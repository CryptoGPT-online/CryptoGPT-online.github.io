### False Positive Misuse ###

- The first misuse report claims that the Key is hardcoded, but it's part of a default fallback component for backward compatibility which is less likely to be used in a real-world security-sensitive setting.
- The second misuse report points out the usage of the insecure FastNonSecureRandom for session ID generation. While it's articulated as a potential vulnerability, the class `TomcatWithFastSessionIDs` is primarily focused to be used for testing purposes and not in production, where secure session ID generation would be required.
- The third misuse report related to ECB mode encryption doesn't apply since `Cipher.getInstance("DESede")` does not specify ECB mode. By default, it uses CBC mode with the "DESede" algorithm.
  
Overall, the provided code is part of a test utility and configuration classes which are not a static piece of a production system but cater to setup and utility needs where specific cryptographic rules may not be strictly enforced as it would be with actual application cryptography. Misuses pointing out hardcoded keys and insecure random for session IDs are not direct security issues if the application uses these classes in the correct context, i.e., for setup, compatibility, or testing.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

Based on the reasoning above, the only remaining misuse is related to the usage of a potentially weak encryption algorithm (3DES) which should be replaced by a stronger alternative such as AES in any security-sensitive context.
