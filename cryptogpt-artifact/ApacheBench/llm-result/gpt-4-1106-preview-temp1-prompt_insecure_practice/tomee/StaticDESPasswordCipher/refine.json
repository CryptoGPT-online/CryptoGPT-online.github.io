### False Positive Misuse ###

The following misuse is a false positive:

- "Improper Error Handling": It is true that the code throws a runtime exception, which is a broad exception type. However, from the provided code, it is not clear that sensitive cryptographic details are revealed. Since the thrown `OpenEJBRuntimeException` does not directly expose cryptographic primitives or secrets, stating that it potentially exposes underlying cryptographic details might be incorrect without more context. Whether this is a security issue depends on what `OpenEJBRuntimeException` does with the caught exception. Since this information is not available, this particular misuse should be considered with caution.

Keep in mind that some of the reported misuses can be generalized, as they are essentially pointing out similar issues under different descriptions or method signatures. In the optimized list, duplicate issues with just different wordings have been merged to avoid repetition, focusing on the root cause of the misuse.
