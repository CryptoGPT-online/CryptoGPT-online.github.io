### False Positive Misuse ###
- The report mentions "Improper Validation of Certificate with HostMismatch (CWE-297)" as a misuse in the encryption/decryption operations. However, a review of the code provided doesn't show any direct use of SSL/TLS network operations inside the `Util.doEncryption` and its related encryption/decryption methods. Therefore, this misuse does not apply to the provided code and should be removed.
- The report about "Unsecured Temporary File" could be a valid concern. However, the provided code deals with creating a temporary file for storing a resized image and doesn't involve encryption keys or other sensitive cryptographic operations. So, this caution is not relevant to the cryptographic context and can be considered a false positive in this specific report.
