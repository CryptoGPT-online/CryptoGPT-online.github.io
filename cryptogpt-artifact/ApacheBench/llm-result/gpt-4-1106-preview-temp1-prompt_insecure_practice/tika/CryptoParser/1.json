        "description": "The 'transformation' parameter should specify a secure transformation including the algorithm, mode, and padding. If only the algorithm name is provided (for example 'AES'), insecure defaults may be used for the mode and padding (possibly ECB mode and PKCS5/PKCS7 padding), which are not secure for sensitive data.",
        "recommendation": "Specify a secure transformation string that includes a strong encryption algorithm, a secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, OFB, GCM or others (avoid using ECB), and a strong padding mechanism (such as PKCS7Padding). For example: 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding'."

        "description": "If CBC mode is used without explicitly specifying an IV, a static IV could be used, which is insecure as it leads to predictable ciphertexts for the same plaintexts and a compromise of confidentiality. The code does not handle the scenario where a default IV might be needed.",

If a weak source of randomness is used for cryptographic functions, it might compromise key generation, IV generation, and more.",
