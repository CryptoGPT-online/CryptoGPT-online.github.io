    "description": "The code generates a key from a password hash by truncating the output of SHA-256 (a 256-bit hash) to 128 bits for AES key generation. The use of SHA-256 for password hashing is weak from a security perspective since it is not resistant to brute-force attacks, as it doesn't include a salt and it's fast.",

    "description": "The encryption process does not use an integrity check (e.g., MAC, HMAC, AEAD) and the AES algorithm is used in ECB mode, which is insecure and can leak information about the plaintext due to patterns preservation.",
    "recommendation": "Use an encryption mode that combines confidentiality with integrity checks, such as GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), and avoid using ECB mode."

    "recommendation": "Ensure that the file containing sensitive cryptographic material is created with the most restrictive permissions possible (e.g., on Unix systems, chmod 600) to minimize the risk of unauthorized access."
