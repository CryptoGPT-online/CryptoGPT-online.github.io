    "description": "The methods 'obfuscate' and 'deobfuscate' provide a weak form of protection for sensitive data. Although they are not directly using cryptographic APIs, they perform operations intended to obscure data in a way that is similarly reversible, which can be easily broken and pose a security risk.",

    "description": "SecureRandom is being used directly without a specified algorithm. While this is not a direct vulnerability, it relies on platform defaults that could be insecure if the default algorithm isn't cryptographically strong.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a known strong algorithm when constructing instances of SecureRandom. For example, `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` can be used to choose a known strong algorithm available on the platform."

    "description": "These methods are using a weak key derivation function 'PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1' with a low number of iterations (1024). Additionally, the use of a static obfuscation salt 'OBFUSCATION_SALT' and passcode 'OBFUSCATION_PASSCODE' within the same class poses a serious security risk, as it could be decompiled and easily broken.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key derivation function, such as Argon2id, and a higher iteration count. The salt should be unique and random for each encryption operation. The key used for encryption should be private and securely managed."
