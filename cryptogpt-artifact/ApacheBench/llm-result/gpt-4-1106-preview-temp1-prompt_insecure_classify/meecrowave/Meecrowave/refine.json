### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Regarding the `TomcatWithFastSessionIDs.start` misuse - This is a test class that comments it uses fast, insecure session ID generation for testing purposes only. It's explicitly stated and acknowledged by the developers, indicating that it's not intended for production use. Therefore, this is not a misuse in the given context.
   
2. The `ValueTransformers$1` misuse - This is an inner class intending to provide a compatibility mode with TomEE for a specific use case. It uses 'Static3DES' which is weaker than AES but its purpose is compatibility, not security. Again, the context seems to indicate it's deliberate and users are aware of the trade-offs.
