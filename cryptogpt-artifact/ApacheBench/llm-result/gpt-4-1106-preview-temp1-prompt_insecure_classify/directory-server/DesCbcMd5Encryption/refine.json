### False Positive Misuse ###
- None of the reported misuses in the first JSON array are false positives since the points raised are valid in the context of the code provided. DES is indeed an outdated encryption standard with inadequate key length, and the given `iv` is static, which is insecure for CBC mode. The use of MD5 for integrity checks and the need to verify the randomness provided by `getRandomBytes()` is also relevant.

The removal of false positives was not applicable in this scenario because the misuses identified have substantiated claims when the provided code is reviewed. The optimized list consolidates the valid concerns with the cryptographic implementations used in the code.
