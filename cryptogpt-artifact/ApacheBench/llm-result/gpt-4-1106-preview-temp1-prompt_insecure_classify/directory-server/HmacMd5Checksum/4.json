        ],
        "description": "MD5 is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes because it is vulnerable to collision attacks. Using HmacMD5 for generating a cryptographic checksum may be risky, as the security of the checksum relies on the resistance of the hash function to collisions.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256, in combination with HMAC. Switch to `Mac.getInstance(\"HmacSHA256\")`. Ensure that all related systems are updated to support the more secure algorithm as well."
