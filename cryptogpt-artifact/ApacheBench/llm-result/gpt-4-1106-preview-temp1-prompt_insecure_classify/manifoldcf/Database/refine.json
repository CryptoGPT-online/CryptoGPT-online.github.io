### False Positive Misuse ###

For the last list of potential misuses, the concerns about hardcoded credentials (CWE-798) are false positives. The code accepts credentials as parameters and assigns them to instance variables, which is a common pattern for object-oriented design in Java. The actual values of the credentials are not hardcoded but are expected to be provided by the caller (e.g., configurations, environment variables, etc.). Therefore, the reported misuse regarding hardcoded credentials is not applicable in this context.
