    "description": "The code uses a fixed salt and a static iteration count which can lead to weak encryption. Furthermore, it employs the PBEWithMD5AndDES algorithm, which uses MD5 (a weak hashing algorithm) and DES (an outdated encryption algorithm with a key size of 56 bits which is considered to be too small).",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm such as AES with a proper key length, a random salt for each encryption, and a higher iteration count."
