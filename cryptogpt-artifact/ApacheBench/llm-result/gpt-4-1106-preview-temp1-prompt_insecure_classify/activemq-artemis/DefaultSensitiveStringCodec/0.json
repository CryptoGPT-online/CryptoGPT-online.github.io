    "description": "The encryption key for Blowfish is hardcoded, which could be extracted from the code base and used to decrypt sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure method to provide the encryption key, such as environment variables or a secure configuration management system, and ensure the key has a sufficient length as well as using a secure key generation process."

    "description": "The Blowfish encryption algorithm uses a hardcoded key 'clusterpassword', meaning the key is the same in every instance and could be discovered by analyzing the code.",

    "description": "The method to generate the salt value does not specify the use of a secure random number generator, potentially leading to weak salts that do not provide enough randomness.",

    "description": "The use of Blowfish as a cryptographic algorithm is regarded as a legacy algorithm and potentially risky due to its 64-bit block size, which makes it susceptible to birthday attacks when used to encrypt large amounts of data.",
    "recommendation": "Switch to a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES."
