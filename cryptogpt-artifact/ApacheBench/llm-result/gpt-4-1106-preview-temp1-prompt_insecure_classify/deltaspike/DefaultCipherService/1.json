        "description": "The system uses a hash of the password as an AES key directly and trims it to 128 bits, which does not ensure adequate entropy if the password is weak. Additionally, not using key derivation functions reduces the strength of the derived key.",

        "description": "The encryption uses AES with a 128-bit key, which might be considered insecure in certain contexts. While AES-128 itself is not broken, the method of key derivation by directly truncating the hash (SHA-256) of the password is insecure.",
