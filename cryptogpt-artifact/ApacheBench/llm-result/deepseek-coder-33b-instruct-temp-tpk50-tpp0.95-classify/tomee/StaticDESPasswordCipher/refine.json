Based on the provided code and misuse reports, we found the following misuses in cryptographic API:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. The Triple-DES encryption algorithm used by the StaticDESPasswordCipher class is known to be weak.
2. CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials. The _3desData variable in the StaticDESPasswordCipher class contains a hard-coded encryption key, which is considered a bad practice for security.
3. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation. The algorithm used is hard-coded to Triple-DES, which might lead to a less secure negotiation.
4. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation. The use of encryption without considering the certificate validation process could potentially lead to security risks.

Below is the JSON format of the misuses:
