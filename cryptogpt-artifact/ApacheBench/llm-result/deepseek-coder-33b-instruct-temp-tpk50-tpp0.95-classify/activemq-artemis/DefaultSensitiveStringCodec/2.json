Based on the code, the issues are mainly related with cryptographic algorithm implementation and security configurations.

Misuses:
1. The `BlowfishAlgorithm` class does not use secure encryption keys for encryption and decryption of sensitive data. It uses hardcoded value "clusterpassword" as a key.

Mitigation:
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure we use a secure and randomly generated secret key for encryption and decryption. The key should be stored in a secure manner and not hardcoded in the code.

2. The `PBKDF2Algorithm` class uses a fixed number of iterations for the PBKDF2 algorithm. This can lead to vulnerability if an attacker is able to guess the key based on the number of iterations.

Mitigation:
To address this issue, we should increase the number of iterations to make the algorithm computation slower and harder for brute force attacks.

3. The `PBKDF2Algorithm` class uses a fixed salt length for the PBKDF2 algorithm. This can lead to vulnerability if an attacker is able to guess the key based on the salt.

Mitigation:
Using a unique salt for every password makes it harder for attackers to use the same salt to try different passwords. This can be achieved by using a secure random salt generation.

4. The `PBKDF2Algorithm` class uses a fixed key length for the PBKDF2 algorithm. This can lead to vulnerability if an attacker is able to guess the key based on the key length.

Mitigation:
The key length should be large enough to resist brute force attacks and should be a multiple of the byte size (e.g., 512 bits for SHA1)

5. The `PBKDF2Algorithm` class does not clean the password after it is used.

Mitigation: We should clear the password after it is used to prevent password leakage.

6. The `DefaultSensitiveStringCodec` class uses a static method `main` for encoding sensitive strings. This method uses the hardcoded password in the main method.

Mitigation: The static method `main` should be removed or secured to prevent unwanted access.

Note: Please note that the mentioned vulnerabilities are only theoretical risks and need to be analyzed based on the security needs of the application.
