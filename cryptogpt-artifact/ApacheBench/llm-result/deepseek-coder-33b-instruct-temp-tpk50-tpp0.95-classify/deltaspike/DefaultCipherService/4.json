The provided code is part of a library for cryptography used in Apache DeltaSpike.

Cryptography-related issues found in the provided code include:

1. Insecure usage of SHA-256 for hash calculations. It is known to have vulnerabilities. Instead, a stronger algorithm should be used.

   Class: `DefaultCipherService`
   Method: `secureHash(String value)`
   Misuse Type: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

Example of vulnerable code:
```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(HASH_ALGORITHM);
```

Recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm like SHA-512, SHA-3, or a higher iteration of SHA-2 (such as SHA-256).

2. Master password is stored in a file as an encrypted string but no password protection is used.

   Class: `DefaultCipherService`
   Method: `getMasterKey(String masterSalt)`
   Misuse Type: CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.

Example of vulnerable code:
```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(CIPHER_ALGORITHM);
```

Recommendation: Use a password protection mechanism like AES with a unique password for every user, rather than hardcoded credentials.

Please note, the fixes are beyond the scope of this tool as they require secure storage of credentials and use of secure encryption algorithms.

Also, make sure the code is not handling sensitive data. If it's handling sensitive data, make sure it's handled properly (e.g., encrypted, hashed, etc.) and the cryptographic methods used are secure.

Do note that security vulnerabilities not necessarily mean the tool is wrong. It just means there's a need to handle the issue in a secure way, and in this case, the suggested fixes might not be suitable.

Please make sure to verify the above findings with an expert or professional for accurate assessment.
