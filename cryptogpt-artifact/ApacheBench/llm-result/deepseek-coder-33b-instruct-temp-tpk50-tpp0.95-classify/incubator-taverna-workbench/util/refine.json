Here are the issues that have been detected:

1. Weak Random Number Generator: The code uses InetAddress.getLocalHost() to generate a random number, but this can be easily guessed if the application is hosted in a publicly accessible environment.

2. Use of an Unsafe Cryptographic Algorithm: The code uses PBEWithMD5AndDES, which is an outdated cryptographic algorithm that is insecure.

3. No use of secure randomness: The use of System.getProperty("user.home") for a random salt is not secure, as this can be easily guessed.

4. No use of salt: The salt used for the encryption is stored in a static field, which makes it susceptible to attacks.

5. Storing passwords in the code: The password for the encryption is stored in a static field which is accessible.

6. No use of secure key storage: The keys used for encryption and decryption are stored in a static variable which makes it susceptible to memory dumping attacks.

7. Insufficient Key Length: The generated encryption key length is 56 bits, which is lower than the recommended length of 128 bits.

8. No use of secure password storage: The password used for encryption is stored in a static variable, making it susceptible to attack.

Here's how the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses in JSON format:

]
```

The cryptographic misuses identified in the code are due to the use of weak random number generators, unsafe cryptographic algorithms, poor salt management, and inadequate key lengths. To ensure secure cryptographic practices, stronger cryptographic algorithms, random and unique salts, secure password storage, and higher key lengths should be used.
