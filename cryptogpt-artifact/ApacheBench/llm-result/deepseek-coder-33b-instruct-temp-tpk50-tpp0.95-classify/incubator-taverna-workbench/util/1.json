The code is quite extensive and there are multiple cryptographic and security issues that can be detected using cryptography and security analysis tools. Since it has been requested, here are some potential issues I found in the code:

1. Use of an unsafe password derivation function: The code uses PBEWithMD5AndDES for password derivation which is known to be insecure.
2. Use of SHA1 for message digest: MD5 is known to be vulnerable to hash collision attacks. The usage of MD5 should be replaced with a more secure alternative like SHA-256.
3. No use of secure randomness: The use of System.getProperty("user.home") for a random salt is not secure, as this can be easily guessed.
4. Use of DES algorithm for encryption: DES is known to be vulnerable to exhaustive search attacks. AES or stronger algorithm should be used instead.
5. No use of secure key storage: The keys used for encryption and decryption are stored in a static variable which makes it susceptible to memory dumping attacks.

In conclusion, this code does not appear to be a good example of secure cryptographic practices. It should be improved to use modern cryptographic techniques and secure random number generators to protect sensitive data.

Here's a simple example of how a better password encryption can look like:

```java
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEParameterSpec;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class SecurePasswordExample {
    private static final int ITERATION_COUNT = 10;

    public static byte[] encrypt(String password, byte[] salt) {
        try {
            SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
            PBEKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, ITERATION_COUNT, 256);
            SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
            return key.getEncoded();
       
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] salt = new byte[32];
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        byte[] encryptedPassword = encrypt("myPassword", salt);
        System.out.println(Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedPassword));
    }
}```

This example uses the PBKDF2 algorithm with a salt that is randomly generated and at a reasonable number of iterations, resulting in a reasonably secure password encryption.

You should replace the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 algorithm to something stronger and appropriate for your needs.

These are just examples, you should also consider other factors such as secure transport of your data, use of secure memory, and input validation to prevent attacks.

Also note that the use of System.out.println in this example is just for illustration and should be replaced with a proper logging library.

It would be a better idea to use libraries like Spring Security, or implement a more sophisticated way of handling password encryption.
