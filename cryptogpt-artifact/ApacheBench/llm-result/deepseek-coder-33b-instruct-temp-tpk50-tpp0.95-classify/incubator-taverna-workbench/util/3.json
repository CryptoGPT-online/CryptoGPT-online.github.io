Security issues in this code are detected:

- Use of the DES algorithm in PBEWithMD5AndDES is known to be insecure. Consider replacing it with a better algorithm such as AES.
- The password for the encryption is stored in a static field which is accessible. You should not hardcode sensitive information like passwords in your code.
- The salt used in the encryption also hardcoded. It's also recommended to store sensitive data such as passwords outside of the code.

The JSON format response is:
