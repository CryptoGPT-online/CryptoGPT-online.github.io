The provided code is an implementation of a cryptography tool named SunJceCrypt in Java. The code uses Sun Java Cryptography API (JCA) for encryption and decryption of strings, primarily for passwords.

Misuses in the provided code are:

1. Inadequate Encryption Strength. The iteration count used in the algorithm is hardcoded as 17, which is relatively low. This means that the encryption algorithm needs to perform more iterations to perform the encryption, making it potentially vulnerable to slower than necessary hardware attacks. The code can be modified to use a higher iteration count.

2. Use of static password and salt. The provided code uses hardcoded, static passwords and salt for the encryption. If these values are compromised, the encryption is susceptible to attacks. The code can be modified to use unique passwords and salt values for each encryption.

Here is the modified code:

```java
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class SunJceCrypt extends AbstractCrypt {
    
    /** Iteration count used in combination with the salt to create the encryption key. */
    private final static int COUNT = 100_000;

    /** Name of the default encryption method */
    public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPT_METHOD = "PBEWithMD5AndDES";

    /** Salt */
    public final static byte[] SALT = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().generateSeed();
    
    ...
    
    protected AlgorithmParameterSpec createParameterSpec()
    {
        return PARAMETER_SPEC;
    }

    protected KeySpec createKeySpec()
   
    {
        return new PBEKeySpec(getKey().toCharArray(), SALT, COUNT);
    }
}
```

This code uses a higher iteration count for security, and dynamically generates salt each time the cryptography tool is used, preventing the same values to be used across multiple usages.

Please note that the actual implementation would need to take into account the needs and constraints of the specific application and environment.

If you found this helpful, please do not hesitate to provide the solution in the correct format.
