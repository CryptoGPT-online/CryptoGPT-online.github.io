The provided code is vulnerable to Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. 

The code uses the PBEWithMD5AndDES method for encryption and decryption. This algorithm is known to be weak and has been criticized for lack of resistance to attacks. It has been suggested to use other cipher algorithm instead.

Misuse Cryptographic Algorithm: The PBEWithMD5AndDES use MD5 as a digest algorithm and DES as the block algorithm, both known to be vulnerable to attacks.
Vulnerable Method: generateSecretKey(), where the SecretKeyFactory.getInstance() method is used with PBEWithMD5AndDES as the argument.
Vulnerable Code: `SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(cryptMethod);`

Recommendation: Use a secure algorithm for cryptographic operations. Candidates are algorithms that are proven to be resistant to attacks. For example, AES with a large number of rounds, or ChaCha20.

You may refer to CWE-327 for further details and fixes.
