The code given is a Java class implementing a symmetric encryption algorithm using Java's javax.crypto library. The given code is used to encrypt and decrypt strings. Here are the security vulnerabilities I found:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The default cryptographic method used is "PBEWithMD5AndDENS". This method is known to be vulnerable and no longer considered secure. The "PBEWithMD5AndDENS" algorithm uses MD5 as the hash function, which is known to be vulnerable to collisions and exploited. It also uses DES for encryption, an extremely old and insecure algorithm.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Valities: The hardcoded salt used in the code is not a random value but rather the same for everyone, so it's predictable and could be exploited.

Here is the sample code that is vulnerable:

```java
public class SunJceCrypt extends AbstractCrypt {
...

private static final PBEParameterSpec PARAMETER_SPEC = new PBEParameterSpec(SALT, COUNT);

...

protected AlgorithmParameterSpec createParameterSpec()
{
    return PARAMETER_SPEC;
}
...
}
```

The solution could involve using a stronger algorithm and a randomly generated salt.

Please note that this code is an example and it is not clear whether this library is used directly by an application, or whether it is part of a larger application framework. In the latter case, the application may have it's own configuration and potentially use a secure algorithm. It's important to check the configuration in such cases.

This code is also part of Apache Wicket, which is widely used in Java web applications, so fixing this issue would be highly recommended.

For example, you could use "PBEwithSHA256and256" as your cryptographic method and use SecureRandom to generate the salt.

You can modify the crypt method like this:

```java
private String cryptMethod = "PBEwithSHA256and256";
```
and in createParameterSpec method replace

```java
return PARAMETER_SPEC;
```

with 

```java
return new PBEParameterSpec(SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().generateSeed(), COUNT);
```

However, please consider consulting with a security expert to make sure the proposed changes are appropriate.

This script is used in Java applications to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. Therefore, changing the encryption method used by the application could affect the integrity of user data.
