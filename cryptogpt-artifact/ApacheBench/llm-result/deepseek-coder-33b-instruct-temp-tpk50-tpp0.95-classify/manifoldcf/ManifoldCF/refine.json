**False Positive Misuse**

Misuse of cryptographic API might come under following categories:

1. Use of Insecure Randomness: The `SecureRandom` class does not provide enough randomness.

Vulnerable Method: `startHash`
Vulnerable Code Snippet: `return MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");`
Description: Using insecure randomness for cryptographic operations can result in vulnerabilities.
Recommendation: Use `SecureRandom` instead of `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA")`.

Misuse of Cryptographic API can have a critical impact. Please validate the cryptographic misuse against the context. The above misuse of cryptographic API might be false positive if the context is secure and the use case is for hashing sensitive data to provide a unique identifier.

Please run your code under a secure context to validate the cryptographic misuse.
