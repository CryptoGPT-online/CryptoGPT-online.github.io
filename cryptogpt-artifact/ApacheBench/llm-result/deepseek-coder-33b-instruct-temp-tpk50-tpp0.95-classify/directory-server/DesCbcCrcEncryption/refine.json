From the provided code, it's evident that the CWE-327 misuse was identified correctly. The issue is with using DES, which is considered a vulnerable and less secure encryption algorithm.

This issue has been reported to the JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "getEncryptionType()",
    "vulnerable_code": "public EncryptionType getEncryptionType() {return EncryptionType.DES_CBC_CRC; }",
    "description": "The encryption type used is DES, which is known to be weak and vulnerable to attacks. This is an issue because it does not meet modern cryptographic standards.",
    "recommendation": "Consider replacing DES with a more secure algorithm such as AES."
  }
]
```

As for Misuse 2, the use of non-random numbers for padding is not applicable in this code because the code does not use a manual padding scheme. It appears to be using an AES-based encryption algorithm, which is generally secure, and does not require padding to a specific length. Additionally, the use of System.arraycopy and concatenation of arrays indicates that a fixed-length byte array is being used as a placeholder for padding, rather than a dynamic random padding.

So, the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses in the same format as the provided JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "getEncryptionType()",
    "vulnerable_code": "public EncryptionType getEncryptionType() {return EncryptionType.DES_CBC_CRC; }",
    "description": "The encryption type used is DES, which is known to be weak and vulnerable to attacks. This is an issue because it does not meet modern cryptographic standards.",
    "recommendation": "Consider replacing DES with a more secure algorithm such as AES."
  }
]
```
