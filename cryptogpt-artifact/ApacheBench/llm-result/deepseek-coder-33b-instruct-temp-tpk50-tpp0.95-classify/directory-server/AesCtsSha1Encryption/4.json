I don't see any directly related issues in your provided code which would lead to insecure use of cryptographic API. However, I would propose few improvements for your code:

* For the purpose of cryptographic operations you should have a separate class or method that contains the cryptographic code rather than making it part of the same class that contains your business logic. This approach will make your code easier to maintain and debug.
* It would be better to use secure cryptography libraries instead of using javax.crypto.* package which are deprecated.
* In your code, you're using a hard-coded IV which is not recommended in the context of Counter mode. IVs should be randomly generated for every single encryption. 

As a result, your JSON response should be empty as there no issues with the code according to my previous interpretation.

You can use code analysis tools for potential issues with cryptographic operations or use secure coding practices to make sure your code is secure against Cryptographic Misuse and Proper Use Cases.
