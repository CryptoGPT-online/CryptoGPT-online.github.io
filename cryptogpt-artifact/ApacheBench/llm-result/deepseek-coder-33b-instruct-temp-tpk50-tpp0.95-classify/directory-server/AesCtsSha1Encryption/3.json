The code you provided is related to encryption and checksum operations using the AES encryption algorithm with the CTS (Ciphertext Stealing) mode and HMAC-SHA1 for checksum.

Misuses and recommendations:

1. Storing sensitive data like keys and passwords directly in the code.
    - Misuse: CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.
    - Description: The keys and passwords used in this code are hardcoded and directly stored in the source code. This is a security risk and should be avoided as it makes the code susceptible to attack.
    - Recommendation: Store sensitive data in environment variables or secure vaults instead of hardcoding them.

2. Using a vulnerable cryptographic algorithm (AES) with a security level below the minimum requirement.
    - Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
    - Description: The AES algorithm is considered secure, but the length of the keys used in this code is not secure. The keys should be at least 128-bit or higher.
    - Recommendation: Update the key length to a higher value, such as 128-bit.

3. Using a weak hash function (SHA1) for checksum calculations.
    - Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
    algorithm is less secure then the requirement.
    - Description: SHA1 is known to be vulnerable to collision attacks, and is considered insecure for many purposes, including hashing passwords.
    - Recommendation: Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm for checksum calculations, such as SHA-2 (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3).

4. Using Crypto API in an incorrect way.
    - Misuse: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.
    - Description: In the encryption process, the initialization vector (iv) is hardcoded to be all zeroes. This is a poor choice for security purposes because it can make the encryption deterministic and easier to crack.
    - Recommendation: Randomize the iv for each encryption operation.

Please note that some of the issues are potential vulnerabilities if they are not addressed. The recommendations provide ways to make the code more secure.
