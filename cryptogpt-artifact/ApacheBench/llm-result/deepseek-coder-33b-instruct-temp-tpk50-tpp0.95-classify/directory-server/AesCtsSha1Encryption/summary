    {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
     "description": "AES/CTS with 'NoPadding' is used indicating no secure padding is being handled, and SHA-1 is used which is vulnerable to collision attacks. It's advised to avoid the combination of CTS, 'NoPadding', and SHA-1 due to risks associated with each."},

    {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
     "description": "The length of the AES keys is not specified which can result in an inefficient key being used, and the potential of hard-coded keys in the source code, which should be stored and handled securely."},

    {"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
     "description": "The IV is either hardcoded as an all-zero value or has a fixed value, which is not random and could compromise encryption security."},

    {"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
     "description": "HmacSHA1 may be prone to vulnerabilities; alternative and more secure hash functions such as SHA-256 should be considered for the checksum process."},

    {"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
     "description": "Sensitive data such as keys and passwords are hardcoded directly in the source code, posing a risk of being exposed to unauthorized parties and should be stored in a more secure manner."}
