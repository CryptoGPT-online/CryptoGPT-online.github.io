This is an example of a misuse:

- CWE-327: The code creates and uses a secret key with the wrong algorithm "ARCFOUR" instead of "HS-MD5". This violates the correct use of cryptographic algorithms. The correct algorithm should be "HmacMD5".

- CWE-295: There's no certificate validation in this code so the integrity of the data cannot be guaranteed. This would not be an issue if the key is securely stored and managed.

- CWE-798: The hardcoded password "SecretKey" is not a good practice.

Here is the JSON response:

}]
```

Please note that I've corrected the wrong name of algorithm in the "vulnerable_code" section.
