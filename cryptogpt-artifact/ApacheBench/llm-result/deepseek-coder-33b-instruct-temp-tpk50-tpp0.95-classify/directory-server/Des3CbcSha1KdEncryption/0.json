Misuses found:

1. The DES (3) encryption is vulnerable to a lot of known attacks that suggest it is not suitable for security applications. It's recommended to use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead, which has a longer block length and is resistant to a more number of attacks.

2. The provided implementation uses DES with CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with no padding. This is not secure and has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. Implementations should always use padding and depending on the specific situation, may want to use authenticated modes of operation (e.g., GCM, CCM).

3. The use of DES and SHA1 for checksum calculation is also considered vulnerable. They should be replaced with stronger algorithms, e.g., AES and SHA-2 (like SHA-256, SHA-3, etc.), at least for new implementations.

4. The code uses DES key derivation via bit manipulation. This is known as a key schedule derived from a master key, a method which is very unsafe and susceptible to many attacks.

5. The encryption is using hardcoded initialization vector (iv). It should be randomly generated and stored alongside the encrypted data.

6. There is no proper handling of unpadding errors when decrypting data. An unpadding error may not cause immediate failure but can lead to security risks if the error is not properly handled.

7. The key derivation function uses hardcoded values which may not be the correct ones depending on the desired security level.

The code lacks sufficient randomness for both encryption keys and initialization vectors. Not using a cryptographically secure random generator makes the resulting keys vulnerable to attack.

Please note, I've listed potential misuses, but it is a good practice to check the correctness of the code based on your requirements and security standards.

In conclusion, the provided code has multiple vulnerabilities related to the cryptographic algorithms used and cryptographic procedures implemented, and thus it is not suitable for a production environment.

Please implement the above mentioned corrections to make the code secure.
