Here are the potential misuses identified:

1. The code uses DESede (DES3) as the encryption algorithm, which is considered as a vulnerable algorithm. CWE-327: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" is related to this issue. The code is using DESede, which is a weak algorithm known to be vulnerable to attacks.

2. The code uses HMAC-SHA1 for integrity checking, which also is considered a weak algorithm. CWE-327: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" is relevant in this case. The code uses HMAC-SHA1, which is also known to be vulnerable to attacks.

3. The code does not handle the exceptions that may occur during encryption and integrity checks. This could potentially lead to uncaught exceptions that may compromise the system's security.

4. The code does not use secure random for generating confounder and salt. CWE-330: "Use of Insufficiently Random Valels" is related to this issue. The random bytes for the confounder and salt are generated using the default random generator, which may not be secure enough.

5. The code uses hardcoded encryption and integrity algorithms. CWE-798: "Use of Hardcoded Credentials" is related to this issue. The algorithms are hardcoded in the code, making it difficult to change them without introducing potential security issues.

The recommendations for fixing these issues include using stronger cryptographic algorithms, handling exceptions properly, using secure random generators for generating confounder and salt, and using configurable parameters for algorithms.
