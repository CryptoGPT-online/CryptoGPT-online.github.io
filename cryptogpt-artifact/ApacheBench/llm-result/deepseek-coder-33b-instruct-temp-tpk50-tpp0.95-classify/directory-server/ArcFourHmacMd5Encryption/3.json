The given code is implementing RC4 HMAC encryption method. This is a weak encryption algorithm due to the susceptibility to various attacks such as linear and timing attacks.

Misuses:

1. Using Weak Cryptographic Algorithms (CWE-327): The code uses "ARCFOUR" algorithm, known as an older cryptographic algorithm, which is not considered strong. It is susceptible to attacks and should be replaced with modern cryptographic algorithms.

2. Usage of RC4 HMAC (CWE-327): Combining RC4 cipher and MD5 hash function (which is vulnerable to certain attacks) may also be vulnerable.

Code Part that is Misusing the Crypto API:

Using 'ARCFOUR' in getEncryptedData method:
```java
return new EncryptedData( getEncryptionType(), key.getKeyVersion(), plainText );
```

Using 'ARCFOUR' in processCipher method:
```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("ARCFOR");
SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec( keyBytes, "ARCFOUR" );
```

Recommendation:

Replace the usage of "ARCFOUR" with a more modern and secure algorithm, such as "AES" ("Advanced Encryption Standard"). For cryptographic integrity, consider using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) library. It offers a number of cryptographic algorithms and is designed to be used with a wide variety of cryptographic protocols.

Here is the sample replacement with AES:
```java
return new EncryptedData( getEncryptionType(), key.getKeyVersion(), processCipher(true, plainText, keyBytes));
```

For 'processCipher' method:
```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec( keyBytes, "AES" );
```

Remember to ensure the appropriate key size, initialization vector (IV), or salt is used when using AES.

Note: You should also make sure that the cryptographic keys used are securely managed and stored. Proper access controls and key usage should be implemented.
