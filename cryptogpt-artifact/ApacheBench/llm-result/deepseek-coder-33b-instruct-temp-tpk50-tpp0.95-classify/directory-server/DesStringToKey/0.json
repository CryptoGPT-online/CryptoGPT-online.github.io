The code is a pure Java implementation of an algorithm to generate a DES key from a password. However, the code uses several deprecated cryptographic functions:

1. DES is a cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered secure.
2. The "DES/CBC/NoPadding" mode uses CBC mode without padding. This may cause problems for plaintexts whose length is not a multiple of the block size (8 bytes in this case).
3. The getStrongKey method uses the DESKeySpec.isWeik function to determine if the generated key is weak, and then corrects it by XOR'ing with 0xF0. However, this function is deprecated in Java 1.7.

As a result, there are potential issues in the code:

1. The misuse of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm: The code uses DES which is known to be vulnerable.
2. Use of weak encryption algorithm: The code uses an algorithm known to be insecure.
3. Use of cryptographic functions that are deprecated: The code uses the isWeak method from the DESKeySpec class, which is deprecated and should not be used anymore.

To correct the issue, the following recommendation is suggested:

1. Replace DES with a more secure algorithm, such as AES.
2. Use padding in the encryption algorithm.
3. Use a non-deprecated cryptographic functions to check the strength of the generated key.

Example of correct code would be using the newer AES encryption algorithm:

```java
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class DesStringToKey {
    public byte[] getKey(String passPhrase) throws Exception {
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();
        return secretKey.getEncoded();
    }
}```

This is a generic example and needs to be replaced with actual functionality.

The cryptographic functions used in the original code also have known vulnerabilities. Please make sure to use proven cryptographic solutions and libraries to avoid any security issues.

Use of hardcoded cryptographic key should be avoided wherever possible. If it is necessary to hardcode a key for development/testing, then it should be kept secret. If the application needs a key, it should be generated randomly and stored securely, ideally in a key vault. 

The use of weak cryptographic algorithms such as DES was commonly seen in legacy systems and code. It's important to identify any old systems that are using these algorithms and update them to use newer, more secure algorithms, if possible.
