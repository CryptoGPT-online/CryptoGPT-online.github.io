The given code is using DES algorithm with CBC mode and MD5 for integrity checks. These are insecure methods that are known to be vulnerable. 

Firstly, the DES algorithm is known to be vulnerable to attacks, while CBC mode is susceptible to attacks if the same IV is used for multiple encryptions of the same plaintext. MD5 is also known to be vulnerable to collisions.

To fix these issues, you can use AES as it is a more secure algorithm and supports modes like GCM which provides both authenticity and integrity. You can consider updating the encryption algorithm and mode to use a more secure pair.

For the MD5, consider alternatives like SHA-256 or at least use a function that incorporates a salt value.

Also, make sure you do not hardcode the IV (Initialization Vector) in your code. IV should be randomly generated and transmitted with the encrypted data.

Here is a potential suggested way to address the CWE-327:

`private static final byte[] iv = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().generateSeed(8);`

This will ensure that a random IV is generated for your session.

Finally, update the processCipher method to use either AES, preferably with GCM. 

`Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");`

Note that the "NoPadding" parameter is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the padding scheme you actually want to use (e.g., "PKCS115padding").

Please consult your security team before replacing these values as the correct configurations may depend on the requirements of your project.
