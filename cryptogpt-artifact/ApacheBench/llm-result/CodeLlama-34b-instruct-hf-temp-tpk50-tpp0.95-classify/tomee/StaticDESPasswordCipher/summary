        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The use of Triple-DES (3DES) for encryption has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. It should not be used for new cryptographic systems as this could lead to plaintext recovery attacks and other serious security issues."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "description": "The secret key used for 3DES encryption is hardcoded in the source code. Hardcoded credentials are easily discoverable by attackers, pose a security risk, and could be used to compromise encryption, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) used for 3DES encryption is not generated randomly, and the hardcoded secret key appears to be insecurely generated. This can reduce the cipher's security, lead to a lack of randomness, and reduce the strength of the encryption."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "description": "The 3DES algorithm uses a key size of 128 bits, which is not sufficient for modern cryptographic standards, and the key used is only 16 bytes long, which is inadequate for encryption. This raises security risks as shorter and weaker keys are vulnerable to brute force attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "description": "The use of a hardcoded secret key in application code is a serious security risk, particularly as an attacker able to decompile the application code may obtain the secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. Proper certificate management and validation procedures are necessary."
