 I have reviewed the provided code and identified several potential cryptographic API misuses. Here is a list of misuses along with their description, recommendation, and relevant code snippet:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Vulnerable Method: `StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt(String)`
Vulnerable Code: `Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION);`
Description: The encryption algorithm used, Triple-DES, is considered to be broken and should not be used for new cryptographic systems. This vulnerability can lead to plaintext recovery attacks and other serious security issues.
Recommendation: Implement a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a sufficient key size. Consider the use of a well-vetted cryptographic library such as OpenSSL or NaCl to ensure that the cryptography is implemented correctly.
2. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Vulnerable Method: `StaticDESPasswordCipher.decrypt(char[])`
Vulnerable Code: `Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION);`
Description: The encryption algorithm used, Triple-DES, is considered to be broken and should not be used for new cryptographic systems. This vulnerability can lead to plaintext recovery attacks and other serious security issues.
Recommendation: Implement a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a sufficient key size. Consider the use of a well-vetted cryptographic library such as OpenSSL or NaCl to ensure that the cryptography is implemented correctly.
3. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
Vulnerable Method: `StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt(String)`
Vulnerable Code: `final SecretKeySpec KEY = new SecretKeySpec(_3desData, "DESede");`
Description: The use of a hardcoded secret key in the application code poses a serious security risk. In particular, an attacker that is able to decompile the application code may be able to obtain the secret key and use it to encrypt and decrypt data.
Recommendation: Implement proper certificate management and validation procedures to ensure that secret keys are securely generated and stored. Consider the use of a hardware security module (HSM) to store the secret key.
4. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
Vulnerable Method: `StaticDESPasswordCipher.decrypt(char[])`
Vulnerable Code: `final SecretKeySpec KEY = new SecretKeySpec(_3desData, "DESede");`
Description: The use of a hardcoded secret key in the application code poses a serious security risk. In particular, an attacker that is able to decompile the application code may be able to obtain the secret key and use it to encrypt and decrypt data.
Recommendation: Implement proper certificate management and validation procedures to ensure that secret keys are securely generated and stored. Consider the use of a hardware security module (HSM) to store the secret key.
5. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Vulnerable Method: `StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt(String)`
Vulnerable Code: `final byte[] _3desData = { (byte) 0x76, (byte) 0x6F, (byte) 0xBA, (byte) 0x39, (byte) 0x31, (byte) 0x2F, (byte) 0x0D, (byte) 0x4A, (byte) 0xA3, (byte) 0x90, (byte) 0x55, (byte) 0xFE, (byte) 0x55, (byte) 0x65, (byte) 0x61, (byte) 0x13, (byte) 0x34, (byte) 0x82, (byte) 0x12, (byte) 0x17, (byte) 0xAC, (byte) 0x77, (byte) 0x39, (byte) 0x19};`
Description: The secret key used for encryption is hardcoded and appears to be insecurely generated. In particular, the key appears to be a simple concatenation of hexadecimal values, which may be vulnerable to brute force attacks.
Recommendation: Implement proper secret key generation and management procedures to ensure that keys are securely generated and stored. Consider the use of a hardware security module (HSM) to store the secret key.
6. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Vulnerable Method: `StaticDESPasswordCipher.decrypt(char[])`
Vulnerable Code: `final byte[] _3desData = { (byte) 0x76, (byte) 0x6F, (byte) 0xBA, (byte) 0x39, (byte) 0x31, (byte) 0x2F, (byte) 0x0D, (byte) 0x4A, (byte) 0xA3, (byte) 0x90, (byte) 0x55, (byte) 0xFE, (byte) 0x55, (byte) 0x65, (byte) 0x61, (byte) 0x13, (byte) 0x34, (byte) 0x82, (byte) 0x12, (byte) 0x17, (byte) 0xAC, (byte) 0x77, (byte) 0x39, (byte) 0x19};`
Description: The secret key used for encryption is hardcoded and appears to be insecurely generated. In particular, the key appears to be a simple concatenation of hexadecimal values, which may be vulnerable to brute force attacks.
Recommendation: Implement proper secret key generation and management procedures to ensure that keys are securely generated and stored. Consider the use of a hardware security module (HSM) to store the secret key.

Based on the analysis of the provided code, it appears that there are several potential cryptographic API misuses that could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the encrypted data. I recommend that you carefully review the provided recommendations and implement the necessary changes to ensure the security of your application.
