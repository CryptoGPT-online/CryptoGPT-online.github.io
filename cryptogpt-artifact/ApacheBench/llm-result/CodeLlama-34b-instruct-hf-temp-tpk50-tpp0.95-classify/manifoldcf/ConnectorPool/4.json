        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_method": "ConnectorPool.pollAll(IThreadContext threadContext)",
        "vulnerable_code": "lockManager.scanServiceData(serviceTypeName, sumClass);",
        "description": "The method uses the scanServiceData method of ILockManager to retrieve service data for a service type, without properly sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the data and potentially cause the system to use an unintended cryptographic algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for retrieving service data, such as ILockManager.getServiceData or ILockManager.getServiceDataNames, and ensure that any input is properly sanitized."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
        "vulnerable_method": "ConnectorPool.createConnectorInstance(IThreadContext threadContext, String className)",
        "vulnerable_code": "Class theClass = ManifoldCF.findClass(className);",
        "description": "The method uses the findClass method of the ManifoldCF class to load a class based on a hardcoded class name. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the system by loading an arbitrary class and potentially causing the system to use hardcoded credentials.",
        "recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials and instead use a secure method for loading classes, such as IThreadContext.loadClass or IThreadContext.getClassLoader."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_method": "ConnectorPool.pollAll(IThreadContext threadContext)",
        "vulnerable_code": "int increment = globalMax >> 2;",
        "description": "The method uses a predictable way to generate random numbers, which could allow an attacker to predict the output and potentially cause the system to use an insufficiently random value. This could potentially weaken the cryptographic security of the system.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as IThreadContext.getSecureRandom, to generate random numbers."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
        "vulnerable_method": "ConnectorPool.pollAll(IThreadContext threadContext)",
        "vulnerable_code": "lockManager.enterWriteLock(targetCalcLockName);",
        "description": "The method uses the enterWriteLock method of ILockManager without properly validating the certificate. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the system by exploiting a vulnerability in the certificate validation process.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that all certificates are properly validated before using them to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities in the certificate validation process."
