 I apologize for the confusion, here is the revised JSON response with the false positive misuses removed:

        }
    ]
}

In this revised JSON response, the false positive misuse report has been removed from the optimized misuse JSON. The false positive misuse report was for the hardcoded credentials misuse, which was identified in the parse method but was not present in the provided code. The other misuse reports remain the same.
