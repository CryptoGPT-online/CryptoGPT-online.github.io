After consolidating the duplicate entries and arranging the others, the JSON list of cryptographic API misuses is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The code is using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which is outdated and considered insecure due to its short key length and vulnerability to brute-force attacks. This misuse appears in several methods such as 'DesStringToKey.calculateChecksum', 'DesStringToKey.getStrongKey', and 'DesStringToKey.generateKey', signaling a need to replace DES with a more secure algorithm like AES."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "description": "The code contains hardcoded credentials, which is a security risk as these are easily discoverable and can lead to unauthorized access. Methods like 'DesStringToKey.calculateChecksum' and 'DesStringToKey.padString' specify hardcoded keys or salts, and they should be replaced with dynamically generated credentials stored and retrieved securely."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "description": "The code uses predictable or insufficiently random values for key derivation or other security-sensitive operations, leading to potential vulnerabilities. Identified in methods like 'DesStringToKey.fanFold' or with fixed salts in 'DesStringToKey.getKey()', it's recommended to use a secure random number generator for random values."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "description": "The usage of a 56-bit key for encryption, as seen in 'DesStringToKey.getKey()', doesn't provide adequate security. Modern encryption practices recommend using stronger key sizes, such as 128 bits or more with the AES algorithm."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "description": "The selection of 'DES/CBC/NoPadding' during cryptographic negotiation is problematic due to the vulnerabilities associated with DES. The use of less-secure algorithms can be a potential risk, and methods like 'DesStringToKey.getKey' and 'DesStringToKey.calculateChecksum' should opt for more secure algorithm choices such as AES."
  }
