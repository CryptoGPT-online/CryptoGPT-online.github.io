 Here is the analysis of the provided Java code:

1. Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* Vulnerable method: `DesStringToKey.getStrongKey()`
	* Vulnerable code: `DESKeySpec.isWeak( secretKey, 0 )`
	* Description: The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used.
	* Recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, and avoid using weak keys.
2. Misuse: CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
	* Vulnerable method: `padString()`
	* Vulnerable code: `byte paddedByteArray[] = new byte[( 8 - length ) + encodedString.length];`
	* Description: The code contains hardcoded credentials, such as the salt value 'SALT', which should not be stored in plaintext.
	* Recommendation: Avoid using hardcoded credentials and instead use secure mechanisms, such as a key management system, to store and manage sensitive data.
3. Misuse: CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
	* Vulnerable method: `getKey()`
	* Vulnerable code: `Cipher.getInstance( 'DES/CBC/NoPadding' )`
	* Description: The code uses the 'DES/CBC/NoPadding' algorithm, which is less secure than other algorithms, such as AES.
	* Recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, and avoid using less secure algorithms, such as DES.

Based on the analysis, it is recommended to replace the use of the DES algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as AES, and avoid using weak keys. Additionally, the code should be refactored to avoid using hardcoded credentials and use a secure mechanism, such as a key management system, to store and manage sensitive data. Finally, the algorithm should be negotiated securely to prevent downgrade attacks.
