After consolidating the duplicated entries and arranging them in the requested JSON format, the consolidated list is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The code uses the insecure \"DES/CBC/NoPadding\" and simply \"DES\" cipher algorithms, which are vulnerable to attacks that use the known plaintext attack and padding oracle attack, and are considered broken."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "description": "The encryption mechanism uses insufficiently random values such as a non-cryptographically secure method CRC32 checksum and a hardcoded checksum value, as well as insecure key generation practices."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "description": "The code uses an encryption key length of 8 bytes with a DES algorithm, which is too small and not considered cryptographically secure."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "description": "The code allows the cipher to be negotiated, which can lead to the selection of an insecure algorithm, and utilizes weak checksum algorithms."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "description": "Hardcoded key material is used in the encryption and decryption process, which is insecure as it doesn't use a secure storage mechanism."
    }
]
```

Please note that I have excluded specific code snippets and merged similar recommendations for brevity and consolidated the results, as per the provided descriptions.
