        "description": "The AES encryption algorithm is used with a fixed key size of 16 bytes, which can be easily broken with modern cryptanalysis techniques. A unique salt value for each user is not employed, and a hardcoded salt value, which can be easily obtained by an attacker, is used instead. SHA-256, a weak hash algorithm, is used for key generation."
