  "recommendation": "Use a well-known secure random number generation algorithm like SHA1PRNG explicitly by calling SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\"). Additionally, consider using the java.security.SecureRandomParameters API instead of nextBytes() for better control over the random number generation process."}]
