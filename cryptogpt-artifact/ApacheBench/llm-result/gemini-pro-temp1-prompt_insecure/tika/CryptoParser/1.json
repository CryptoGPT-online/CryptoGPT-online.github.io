```java
super.parse(
                    new CipherInputStream(stream, cipher),
                    handler, metadata, context);
```

The issue is that if the key used to decrypt the stream is weak, an attacker could potentially recover the plaintext data.
The recommended fix is to use a strong key to encrypt the data.
