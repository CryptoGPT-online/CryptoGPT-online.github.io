### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse:** Weak Crypto Algorithm
    - **Vulnerable Method:** getInstance
    - **Vulnerable Code:** `Cipher.getInstance( "AES/CTS/NoPadding" )`
    - **Reason:** The misuse report assumes that AES/CTS/NoPadding is a weak algorithm, but it is not applicable in this context because this is the expected algorithm for this type of encryption.
