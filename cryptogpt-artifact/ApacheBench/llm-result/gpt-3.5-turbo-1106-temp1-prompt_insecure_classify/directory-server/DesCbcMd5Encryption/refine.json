[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "DesCbcMd5Encryption.processCipher",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance( \"DES/CBC/NoPadding\" );",
    "description": "DES/CBC/NoPadding is considered a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for secure data transmission.",
    "recommendation": "Replace DES/CBC/NoPadding with a more secure algorithm such as AES/GCM/NoPadding."
  },

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "DesCbcMd5Encryption.processCipher",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance( \"DES/CBC/NoPadding\" );",
    "description": "Using the DES algorithm with CBC mode can lead to inadequate encryption strength, as DES is considered to have insufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Upgrade to a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES, and ensure appropriate key lengths and iteration numbers are used for key generation."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values for cryptographic context",
    "vulnerable_method": "DesCbcMd5Encryption.processCipher",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static final byte[] iv = new byte[] { ( byte ) 0x00, ... };",
    "description": "Using a hardcoded initialization vector (IV) which may lead to potential security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for each encryption operation and securely pass it along with the ciphertext."
