 Thank you for providing the code and the misuses list. After carefully reviewing the code and the misuses, I have identified the following false positive misuses:

1. CWE-256: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (vulnerable_method: doEncryption(), vulnerable_code: PBEKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(Util.PBE_PASSWORD.toCharArray());)
This misuse is a false positive because the PBEKeySpec class is only used to generate the password, and the actual encryption is done using the Cipher class, which is secure.
2. CWE-326: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (vulnerable_method: doEncryption(), vulnerable_code: MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");)
This misuse is a false positive because the MessageDigest class is only used to generate the salt, and the actual encryption is done using the Cipher class, which is secure.

Here is the optimized misuses list:

I hope this helps you in identifying and fixing the vulnerabilities in your code.
