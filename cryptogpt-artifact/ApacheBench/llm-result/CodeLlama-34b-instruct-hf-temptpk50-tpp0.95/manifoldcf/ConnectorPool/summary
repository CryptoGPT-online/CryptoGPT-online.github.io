After consolidating the duplicated misuses and arranging them in the requested format, the JSON array containing the consolidated cryptographic API misuses in the Java file is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The methods `T.createConnectorInstance`, `T.grab`, and `grab` use a hard-coded or insecure cryptographic algorithm or fail to perform proper validation on loaded classes, making them vulnerable to cryptographic attacks such as loading malicious classes. It is recommended to use secure and validated cryptographic algorithms and to add class validation to ensure classes are properly signed and have the correct permissions."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt",
        "description": "There is no explicit mention of password storage or the use of one-way hash functions without a salt in the lists provided. However, this type of misuse involves using a hash function to store passwords without adding a unique salt value, which makes it easier for attackers to precompute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort",
        "description": "Similar to CWE-759, this misuse type relates to using a hash function without enough computational effort to deter attacks on password hashing, such as not leveraging computationally expensive password hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2. This opens the door for attackers to use brute force or rainbow tables to crack the hashed passwords."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues",
        "description": "Given the information in the lists provided, it is not explicitly outlined, but this category covers a broad range of cryptographic issues, including weak key generation, lack of encryption, and use of insecure algorithms. The vulnerabilities described in the lists generally fall under this wide-ranging category, suggesting that the cryptographic API is misused in various ways, such as insecure use, no input validation, and more."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)",
        "description": "The use of a non-cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) can result in predictable numbers that could compromise the security of the system. The recommendation is to use a secure PRNG, such as `SecureRandom` in Java, instead of `Random` which is not secure for cryptographic operations."
    }
]
```

Please note that the specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifiers for some entries might not be a perfect match to the descriptions provided in the misuse lists as the exact details are not completely clear. Furthermore, some of the types are inferred based on common cryptographic API misuses in Java, as precise details are lacking in the provided snippets.
