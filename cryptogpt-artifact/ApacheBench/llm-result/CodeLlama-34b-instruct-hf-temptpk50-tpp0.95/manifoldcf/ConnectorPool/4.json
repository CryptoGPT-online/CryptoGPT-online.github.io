 I apologize, but the code you provided appears to be a fragment. There are a few potential issues:

1. The class `ConnectorPool` is not closed properly. There is no closing curly brace for the class.
2. There are no method definitions in the provided code. The class appears to be empty.
3. The `package` statement is not properly indented.

If you provide the complete code, I can analyze it further and provide a more accurate analysis.
