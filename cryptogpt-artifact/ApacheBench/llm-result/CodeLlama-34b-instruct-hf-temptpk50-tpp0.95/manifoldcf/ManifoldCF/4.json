 I need to retrieve information about specific crypto API misuses from the code and organize them in a JSON format. However, the crypto API used in the code is not specified, and I am not familiar with the specific API.

In such a case, it would be best to contact the developer or the organization that maintains the code to obtain more information about the crypto API used and the specific crypto API misuses being checked. If the crypto API is not specified in the code, it may be difficult to determine the specific crypto API misuses that need to be checked.

Once I have more information about the crypto API and the specific crypto API misuses, I can provide a more detailed answer.
