After consolidating the duplicates and arranging the others in the requested format, the consolidated list of cryptographic API misuses and related issues in Java code is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password or Personal Identifiable Information",
    "description": "The code is storing a password or personal identifiable information in plaintext, which could lead to unauthorized access if an attacker gains access to the storage medium or database."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "description": "The code is accepting all server certificates as trusted, which could lead to unauthorized access if an attacker is able to intercept the communication or present an impersonated server certificate."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The code is using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, which could lead to unauthorized access if an attacker is able to intercept or impersonate the communication."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "description": "The code is using an inadequate level of encryption, which could lead to unauthorized access if an attacker is able to intercept or impersonate the communication."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)",
    "description": "The cipher algorithm used is vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks due to the use of a weak PRNG."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
    "description": "The key used by the cipher algorithm is hard-coded in the source, which can lead to attacks if discovered."
  }
]
```

Note: For the sake of brevity and because the descriptions are similar, multiple instances of misuse related to known-plaintext attacks (e.g., CWE-338, CWE-547, CWE-650, CWE-757, CWE-759, CWE-760) have been consolidated under a single entry (CWE-338). Similarly, repeated entries for CWE-256, CWE-295, CWE-326, and CWE-327 security vulnerabilities were merged into single entries each. Moreover, some identified misuses (e.g., CWE-297 about predictable IV) have not been provided with detailed descriptions and recommendations in the lists and are therefore not included in the final JSON output.
