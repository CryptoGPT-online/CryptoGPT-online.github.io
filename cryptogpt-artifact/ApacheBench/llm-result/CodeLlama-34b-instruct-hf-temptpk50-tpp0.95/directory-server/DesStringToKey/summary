After consolidating the duplicated misuses and arranging the unique ones, the list is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The code utilizes DES encryption, which is a broken and insecure algorithm due to its insufficient key size and vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Modern computing power can easily compromise DES encrypted data."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password or Encryption Key",
        "description": "The encryption key is stored or handled in plaintext within the application or system's memory. This presents a risk where attackers could read the key directly from memory or storage, defeating the purpose of encryption."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "description": "The application does not properly verify that the certificate is valid for the requested context, allowing an attacker to present a certificate that is technically valid, but not for the intended party."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
        "description": "The application fails to validate that the certificate presented matches the host to which the connection is being made, leading to a potential man-in-the-middle attack."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
        "description": "The application contains hardcoded cryptographic keys which can be identified through analysis of the source or executable. These hardcoded keys are easily retrievable by attackers."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "description": "The cryptographic operation utilizes an encryption scheme with an inadequately short key size, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-338: Weak Padding Method",
        "description": "The padding scheme used in the cryptographic operation is weak or nonexistent, which can make it susceptible to padding oracle attacks and compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the encrypted data."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-547: Access Restrictions Not Applied to Sensitive Data",
        "description": "Sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys or personally identifiable information (PII), are not properly protected with appropriate access controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access or disclosure."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-650: Failure to Sanitize Input",
        "description": "Input used within a cryptographic operation is not properly sanitized, which can lead to various attacks if the input contains malicious payloads or unexpected characters."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "description": "Cryptographic operations rely on values that lack sufficient randomness, potentially allowing an attacker to predict, influence, or reproduce the values."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-759: Unsalted Hash Used for Password Storage",
        "description": "Stored passwords use an unsalted or improperly salted hash, making them more vulnerable to dictionary and rainbow table attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-760: Predictable Random Value",
        "description": "A cryptographic operation that requires randomness uses a source that may be predictable, thus undermining the security of the operation by allowing an attacker to predict future outputs."
    }
