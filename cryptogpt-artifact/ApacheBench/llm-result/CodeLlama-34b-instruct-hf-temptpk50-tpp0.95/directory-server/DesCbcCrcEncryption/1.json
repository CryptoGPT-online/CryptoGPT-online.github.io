"misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Sensitive Data in a File",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptedData.getEncryptedData()",
"vulnerable_code": "EncryptedData",
"description": "The getEncryptedData() method stores the sensitive data (encryption key) in plaintext inside the EncryptedData object, which can be easily accessed by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Do not store sensitive data in plaintext. Instead, use a secure storage mechanism such as a secure database or a hardware security module (HSM) to store the encryption key."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionEngine.getEncryptionType()",
"vulnerable_code": "EncryptionType.DES_CBC_CRC",
"description": "The getEncryptionType() method does not perform proper validation of the encryption type, which allows an attacker to manipulate the encryption type and execute an attack.",
"recommendation": "Perform proper validation of the encryption type to ensure that it is secure and trusted."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionEngine.getDecryptedData()",
"vulnerable_code": "EncryptionKey.getKeyValue()",
"description": "The getDecryptedData() method does not properly validate the encryption key against the host, which allows an attacker to manipulate the encryption key and execute an attack.",

},
{
"misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.getKeyValue()",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKey",
"description": "The getKeyValue() method uses a hard-coded cryptographic key, which can be easily extracted by an attacker and used to execute an attack.",
"recommendation": "Do not use hard-coded cryptographic keys. Instead, use a secure method to store and retrieve the encryption key, such as a secure database or a hardware security module (HSM)."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.getKeyValue()",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec",
"description": "The getKeyValue() method uses a weak encryption algorithm (DES) with a small key size (56-bit), which can be easily brute-forced by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a strong and secure encryption algorithm with a large key size (e.g., AES-256) to ensure adequate encryption strength."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.getKeyValue()",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec",
"description": "The getKeyValue() method uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (DES), which is vulnerable to attacks such as DES weaknesses and related-key attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and reliable cryptographic algorithm (e.g., AES) to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted data."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Insufficient Key Size",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.getKeyValue()",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec",
"description": "The getKeyValue() method uses a small key size (56-bit) for the encryption algorithm (DES), which can be easily brute-forced by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key size (e.g., 256-bit) for the encryption algorithm to ensure adequate encryption strength and prevent attacks such as brute-force attacks."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-547: Use of Incorrect Parameter in Password Hashing",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.calculateIntegrity()",
"vulnerable_code": "int2octet()",
"description": "The calculateIntegrity() method uses an incorrect parameter (0xFF) in the password hashing function (CRC32), which can lead to hash collision attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a correct parameter in the password hashing function to prevent hash collision attacks."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-650: Failure to Set Cookie with HttpOnly Flag",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.calculateIntegrity()",
"vulnerable_code": "CRC32",
"description": "The calculateIntegrity() method does not set the HttpOnly flag in the cookie, which can allow an attacker to steal the cookie and execute an attack.",
"recommendation": "Set the HttpOnly flag in the cookie to prevent an attacker from stealing the cookie."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.getRandomBytes()",
"vulnerable_code": "EncryptionKey.getEncryptionType()",
"description": "The getRandomBytes() method uses an insufficiently random value (iv) for the encryption algorithm, which can allow an attacker to predict the next block of data and execute an attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a random value that is generated using a secure random number generator (e.g., SecureRandom) to ensure the randomness and security of the encryption algorithm."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-759: Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionKey.getEncryptionType()",
"vulnerable_code": "EncryptionType.DES_CBC_CRC",
"description": "The getEncryptionType() method uses hard-coded credentials (EncryptionType.DES_CBC_CRC), which can be easily extracted by an attacker and used to execute an attack.",

},
{
"misuse": "CWE-760: Incorrect Classification of Failure to Use Internal Error Handling Mechanism",
"vulnerable_method": "EncryptionEngine.getDecryptedData()",
"vulnerable_code": "EncryptionKey.getKeyValue()",
"description": "The getDecryptedData() method does not use an internal error handling mechanism to handle errors, which can allow an attacker to execute an attack.",
