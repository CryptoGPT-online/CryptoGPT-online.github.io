        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "description": "Various methods are not performing proper validation of encryption types or certificates which can allow an attacker to manipulate and execute attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
        "description": "The getDecryptedData method does not properly validate the encryption key against the host, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the encryption key."
