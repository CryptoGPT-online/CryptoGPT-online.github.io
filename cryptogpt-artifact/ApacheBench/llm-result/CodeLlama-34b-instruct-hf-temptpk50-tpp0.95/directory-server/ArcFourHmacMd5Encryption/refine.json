 ### False Positive Misuse

The following misuses are not applicable due to their nature and the context of the code:

1. CWE-256: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (applicable to `processCipher` method)
	* The `processCipher` method is used to process ciphertext, not generate it. Therefore, the use of a potentially weak cipher algorithm is not a vulnerability.
2. CWE-321: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (applicable to `calculateIntegrity` method)
	* The `calculateIntegrity` method is used to compute a message authentication code, not to generate a cryptographic key. Therefore, the use of a potentially weak cipher algorithm is not a vulnerability.
3. CWE-327: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (applicable to `SecretKeySpec` constructor)
	* The `SecretKeySpec` constructor is not used to generate a cryptographic key, but rather to generate a secret key from a provided byte array. Therefore, the use of a potentially predictable value is not a vulnerability.

### Optimized Misuse JSON

Here is the optimized list of misuses in JSON format:

It is important to note that the optimized list of misuses may not include all potential security issues in the code, and it is always recommended to consult with a security expert for a comprehensive security audit.
