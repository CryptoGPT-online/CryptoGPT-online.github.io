 Here are the security issues related to the code you provided:

1. **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**: The code uses the Triple DES encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for new implementations. It has a 56-bit key size, which is also considered too small for secure encryption.
2. **CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation**: The code does not perform proper certificate validation, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. **CWE-297: Improper Certificate Validation**: The code does not check the revocation status of the server's certificate, which can lead to the acceptance of revoked certificates.
4. **CWE-338: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**: The code uses the HmacSHA1 algorithm for calculating the checksum, which is considered broken and should not be used for new implementations.
5. **CWE-547: Improper Checking of Return Value**: The code does not check the return value of the encrypt() and decrypt() functions, which can lead to data corruption or manipulation.
6. **CWE-757: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**: The code uses the DES3 algorithm for generating the random confounder, which is considered broken and should not be used for new implementations.
7. **CWE-759: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**: The code uses the DES3 algorithm for generating the checksum, which is considered broken and should not be used for new implementations.
8. **CWE-760: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**: The code uses the DES3 algorithm for generating the derived key, which is considered broken and should not be used for new implementations.

Recommendations:

* Replace Triple DES with a secure encryption algorithm such as AES.
* Perform proper certificate validation and check the revocation status of the server's certificate.
* Use a secure checksum algorithm such as SHA-256.
* Check the return value of the encrypt() and decrypt() functions.
* Replace DES3 with a secure algorithm such as AES for generating the random confounder and checksum.
* Replace DES3 with a secure algorithm such as AES for generating the derived key.
