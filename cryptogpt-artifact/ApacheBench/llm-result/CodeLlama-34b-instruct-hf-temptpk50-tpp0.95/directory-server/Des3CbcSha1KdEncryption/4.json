 "vulnerable_code": "random-to-key(DR(Key, Constant))",
 "description": "The `deriveKey` method in `Des3CbcSha1KdEncryption` uses the `random-to-key` function, which is a weak key derivation function that is vulnerable to brute force attacks. The method takes a base key, a usage constant, and two integers as input, and uses these values to derive a subkey that is used for encryption or decryption. The `random-to-key` function uses a 7-bit group of the input key, and sets the parity bits to a fixed value. This can be vulnerable to attacks that rely on weaknesses in the PRNG used to generate the subkey.",
 "recommendation": "Update the `deriveKey` method to use a stronger key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or HKDF, that takes a salt value as input. The salt value should be a unique, high-entropy value that is generated for each key derivation. Additionally, consider using a larger key size, such as 256 bits, to reduce the risk of brute force attacks."
