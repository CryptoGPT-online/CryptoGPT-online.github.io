 Here is the JSON response:

[
{"misuse": "CWE-256: Unsafe Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_method": "org.apache.directory.server.kerberos.shared.crypto.encryption.DesCbcMd5Encryption.processCipher",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/CBC/NoPadding\");",
"description": "The DES encryption algorithm is considered insecure and should not be used. It has been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including brute force attacks. In addition, the 'NoPadding' option can leave the encrypted data vulnerable to padding attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, and make sure to use proper padding."
}
