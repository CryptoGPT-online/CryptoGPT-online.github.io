 ### False Positive Misuses

* The use of the `toString()` method in the `arrayToString()` method is not necessarily a security issue. It is true that using `toString()` to convert an array of objects to a string can lead to vulnerabilities if the objects in the array are not properly sanitized, but this is not a security vulnerability in the `Diff` class itself. The `Diff` class does not use `toString()` to perform any sensitive operations, such as storing sensitive data or performing cryptographic operations. Therefore, this is a false positive misuse.
* The `editAll()` method in the `Diff` class blindly appends "<edited>" to the end of each element in the array, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the array contains sensitive information. However, this method is marked as "For testing purposes only" and is not intended for use in a production environment. Therefore, this is a false positive misuse.
* The `randomEdit()` method in the `Diff` class randomly edits the elements in an array, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the array contains sensitive information. However, this method is marked as "For testing purposes only" and is not intended for use in a production environment. Therefore, this is a false positive misuse.
* The `shuffle()` method in the `Diff` class randomly shuffles the elements in an array, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the array contains sensitive information. However, this method is marked as "For testing purposes only" and is not intended for use in a production environment. Therefore, this is a false positive misuse.
