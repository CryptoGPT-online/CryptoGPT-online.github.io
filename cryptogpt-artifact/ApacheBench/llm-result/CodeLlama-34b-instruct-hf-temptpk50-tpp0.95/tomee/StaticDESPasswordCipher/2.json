[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')",
        "vulnerable_method": "decrypt",
        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(encodedPassword).getBytes()",
        "description": "The code uses string concatenation to form a URL, which can lead to injection attacks. For example, if the input string contains a '%', it will be interpreted as the start of an escape sequence. This can be exploited to access data that the application is not intended to access.",
        "recommendation": "Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. For other types of injection, use input validation and encoding to ensure that user input is properly sanitized."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_method": "decrypt",
        "vulnerable_code": "cipher.getInstance(\"DESede\")",
        "description": "The code uses the Triple-DES encryption algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for new code. It has a 56-bit key size, which is too small to provide adequate security.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, with a larger key size, such as 128 bits or more."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password or Other Sensitive Data",
        "vulnerable_method": "encrypt",
        "vulnerable_code": "plaintext.getBytes()",
        "description": "The code stores plaintext passwords in the Base64-encoded bytes of the encrypted password. This can allow an attacker to obtain the plaintext passwords, even if the encryption algorithm is secure.",
        "recommendation": "Do not store plaintext passwords or other sensitive data in cleartext. Instead, use secure password hashing algorithms, such as Argon2 or bcrypt, to store the hashed values of the passwords."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
        "vulnerable_method": "decrypt",
        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(encodedPassword).getBytes()",
        "description": "The code uses a static key to encrypt and decrypt passwords. This can allow an attacker to intercept the encryption key and use it to decrypt the passwords, even if the encryption algorithm is secure.",
        "recommendation": "Use a dynamic key that is generated for each session and is never stored in cleartext. Also, make sure to validate the hostname of the certificate to ensure that it matches the expected hostname."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-759: Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_method": "decrypt",
        "vulnerable_code": "static final byte[] _3desData = { ... };",
        "description": "The code uses a static and hardcoded key for encryption and decryption. This can allow an attacker to obtain the key and use it to decrypt the passwords, even if the encryption algorithm is secure.",
        "recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials in your code. Instead, use a secure mechanism to store and retrieve sensitive data, such as a secure password vault or a key management system."
