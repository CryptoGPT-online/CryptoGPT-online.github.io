 Here are some security issues that could be present in the provided code:

* CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (line 43)
* CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (line 53)
* CWE-326: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Key (line 55)
* CWE-338: Use of Key-Based Cryptography without Key Management (line 56)

The code is using a hard-coded encryption key, which is not secure. It is also using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (AES in ECB mode) and not using a secure random number generator to generate the initialization vector. Additionally, the code does not seem to be using a secure key management system, which could lead to key management issues.

The code also has some style and formatting issues, such as inconsistent indentation and missing curly braces. It would be good to address these issues as well.
