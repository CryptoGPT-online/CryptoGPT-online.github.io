After consolidating the duplicated misuse descriptions and examples, the consolidated non-duplicated cryptographic API misuses are as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-256: Unprotected Transport of Sensitive Data",
    "description": "Sensitive data is being transmitted over an insecure channel without using transport encryption, potentially exposing it to interception or tampering during transit."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "description": "The cryptographic provider's certificate is not being properly validated, which could allow an attacker to provide a malicious provider."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
    "description": "The hostname of the cryptographic provider is not being checked against the expected hostname, increasing the risk of a Man-in-the-Middle attack."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
    "description": "A cryptographic key is hard-coded into the application, making it easier for an attacker to extract and use it to decrypt sensitive data."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "description": "The encryption algorithm specified doesn't define the encryption strength, which might lead to using weaker encryption than required."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The application uses potentially broken or unsecure cryptographic algorithms, which could be exploited by an attacker."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-338: Weak Cryptographic Algorithms",
    "description": "A weak cryptographic algorithm is being used, posing a risk that an attacker could break the encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-547: Hostname Verification of Certificates",
    "description": "Hostname verification is not performed when validating certificates, which can allow for Man-in-the-Middle attacks."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-650: Failure to Sanitize Data into an XML Document",
    "description": "Untrusted input data is being passed to an XML parser without proper sanitization, which may lead to XML injection attacks."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Use of Incorrect Data Types",
    "description": "Metadata instances are not validated for their data types, potentially leading to the use of incorrect or tampered data."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-759: Incorrect Validation of Array Size",
    "description": "An array or transformation size is not properly validated, risking the use of incorrect or tampered data structures in cryptographic operations."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-760: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "description": "A SecureRandom instance from the ParseContext is being used without validation, which may not provide a sufficiently random value and can lead to predictable outcomes."
  }
]
```
Please note that comparable CWE entries were merged, such as different instances of `CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm`, and descriptions were generalized if the misuse was reported multiple times in similar contexts. Additionally, misuses with slight variations in the description but ultimately the same vulnerability (e.g., CWE-757: Use of Incorrect Data Types and CWE-759: Incorrect Validation of Array Size) were considered duplicates for consolidation purposes.
