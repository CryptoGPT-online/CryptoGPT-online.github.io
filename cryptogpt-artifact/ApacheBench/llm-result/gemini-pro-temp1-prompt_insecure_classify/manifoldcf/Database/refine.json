### False Positive Misuse ###

- The reported misuse of “CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.” in method randam() is false positive. The code does not use any random function.
- The reported misuse of “CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.” in method verify() is false positive. The code is not related to certificate validation.
- The reported misuse of “CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.” in method connect() is false positive. The code does not use hardcoded credentials.
- The reported misuse of “CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.” in method negotiate() is false positive. The code does not use negotiation.
