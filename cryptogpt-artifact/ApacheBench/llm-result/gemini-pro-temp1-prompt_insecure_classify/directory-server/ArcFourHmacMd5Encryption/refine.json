### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

This misuse is a false positive because the ArcFourHmacMd5Encryption class uses the RC4 algorithm, which is still considered to be adequate for many applications. Although RC4 is not as strong as modern algorithms like AES, it is still significantly stronger than no encryption at all.
