### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
   - **Vulnerable Method:** encrypt
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance( "DES/CBC/NoPadding" );`
   - **Reason:** DES is still considered secure for some applications, such as legacy systems or applications with low security requirements.
