### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
   - **Reason**: The method `getRandomBytes()` is used to generate a random confounder. However, the Java API's SecureRandom class should be used instead to ensure cryptographically secure randomness.
   
2. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
   - **Reason**: The code does not validate the certificate in any way. This could allow an attacker to present a forged certificate and decrypt the data.
