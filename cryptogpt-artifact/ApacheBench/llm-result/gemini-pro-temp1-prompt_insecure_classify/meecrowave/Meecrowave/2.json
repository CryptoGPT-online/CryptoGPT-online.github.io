"description": "Meecrowave uses Static3DES to decrypt encoded password. DESede is an old standard for encryption and should not be used anymore. Key must contain 24 bytes, and the cipher will use a weak padding scheme. So, if the password encoded uses a large key and a modern cipher like AES, the decrypted password will be truncated.",
"recommendation": "It's recommended to use AES in CBC or GCM mode."
