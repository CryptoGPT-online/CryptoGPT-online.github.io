Sorry, I did not find any specific instances of use of crypto APIs, but I will provide a common example of an insecure usage for the sake of clarification:

Let's consider the "PBE_PASSWORD" and "PBE_SALT" constants for encryption. 

```java
private static final String PBE_PASSWORD = System.getProperty("user.home");
private static final String PBE_SALT;

static {
	String host_name = "";
	try {
	  host_name = InetAddress.getLocalHost().toString();
	} catch (UnknownHostException e)
	host_name = "unknown_localhost";
	PBE_SALT = host_name;
}
```

The usage of user.home as the password for encryption is a common mistake in security. It is generally a bad practice to use the home directory as a password or salt. Moreover, using the network address of the localhost as salt is also not recommended. 

A potential recommendation is to use a secure, hard-to-guess value for the password, and a hard-to-guess unique value for the salt. Such values could be stored as environmental variables or configuration properties.

Here's a suggestion for the code:

```java
private static final String PBE_PASSWORD = System.getenv("MY_SECURE_PASSWORD");
private static final String PBE_SALT = System.getenv("MY_SECURE_SALT");
```

And the user should make sure the environmental variables are set with secure values.
