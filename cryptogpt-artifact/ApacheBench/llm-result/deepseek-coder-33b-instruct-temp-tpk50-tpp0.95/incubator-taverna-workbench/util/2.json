Here are the potential security issues that I found in the code:

1. CWE-256 (Unprotected Storage of Passwords (or Credentials) in a Configuration File.):
- vulnerable_method: The `encrypt()`, `decrypt()`, and `doEncryption()` methods in the `Util` class are used for encryption and decryption of passwords.
- vulnerable_code:
```java
public static byte[] encrypt(String str) {
    return (doEncryption(str, Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE));
}
```
- description: The encryption methods in the code use a password and salt for encryption which is hardcoded in the program. This means the password and salt used for encryption are not dynamically generated and are not protected against unauthorized access or manipulation.
- recommendation: The password and salt used for encryption should be stored in a secure manner such as a configuration file that is encrypted or a key store.

Please note that CWE-256 does not necessarily mean the entire code is vulnerable, but rather a portion of the code is storing sensitive information (in this case, passwords and salt) in a plaintext manner.

2. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:
- vulnerable_method: The `doEncryption()` method in the `Util` class uses the DES algorithm for encryption and decryption.
- vulnerable_code:
```java
private static byte[] doEncryption(String str, int mode) {
    // password-based encryption uses 2 parameters for processing:
    // a *password*, which is then hashed with a *salt* to generate
    // a strong key - these 2 are defined as class constants
    try {
      SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBEWithMD5AndDES");
      PBEKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(Util.PBE_PASSWORD.toCharArray());
      SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
      MessageDigest md = MessageDesx.getInstance("MD5");
      md.update(Util.PBE_SALT.getBytes());
      byte[] digest = md.digest();
```
- description: The DES algorithm is known to be vulnerable to attacks and should not be used for encryption of sensitive data.
- recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm for encryption such as AES or RSA.

It seems like other CWE categories are not applicable in this code context, as there does not seem to be any issues with memory management or handling of errors.

I recommend considering the use of a library for handling sensitive data and consider implementing additional security features to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities.

Please note that Cryptographic operations are inherently difficult to get right, and even well-known, widely used algorithms such as DES and AES are known to be vulnerable to certain types of attacks. Therefore, it is advisable to use libraries and platforms that have been tested and proven secure.

If you want a full audit of the code, I would recommend using a tool like SonarQube, it can analyze your code and detect a variety of vulnerabilities.
