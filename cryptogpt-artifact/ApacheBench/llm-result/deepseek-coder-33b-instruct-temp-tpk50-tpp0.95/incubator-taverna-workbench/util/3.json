There are some potential issues in your code. However, I'm unable to confirm those issues because the code appears to be a utility class for various operations. Therefore, I have checked only the code that is not written within the classes such as the `getResizedImageIcon` method. There may be more problems in the other classes or methods. 

1. The `doEncryption` method in the class `Util` uses the "PBEWithMD5AndDES" algorithm for the password-based encryption. It's known to be vulnerable to the Cryptographic Attacks and is considered a weak algorithm for security purposes. The "PBEWithMD5AndDES" algorithm is no longer recommended for use in newer systems, and newer alternatives should be used.

2. The `getResizedImageIconTempFileURL` method in the `Util` class creates a temporary file for storing resized images. However, if the specified URL does not contain an image, the program will be unable to convert it. This could potentially result in a NullPointerException during execution.

3. There are a lot of similar methods in `Util`. It seems like there are opportunities for code duplication. You could consider using a generic method to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

4. The `composeAPIQueryElements` method in the `Util` class generates a string that represents part of the URL query for myExperiment API. However, the code doesn't seem to check the null value of 'queryInstance' and the possible null values from 'getRequiredAPIElements()' might cause NullPointerExceptions. 

5. The `getBaseClassName` method in the `Util` class gets the base class name from the class name. However, it seems it will not work properly if the class is nested inside another class.

Please confirm these issues or any other potential issues in your code.
