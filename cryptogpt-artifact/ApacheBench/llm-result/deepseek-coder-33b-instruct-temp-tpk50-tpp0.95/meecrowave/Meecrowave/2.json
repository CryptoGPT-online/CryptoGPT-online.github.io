Your code seems to be a project that uses Apache Tomcat embedded, CXF (a JAX-RS implementation), OpenWebBeans (an implementation of Java EE) as the Bean Manager, and Log4j for logging. 

The question you asked is about Java cryptography, but it doesn't appear that the code relies heavily on the cryptography in any way. The javax.crypto and java.security libraries aren't used extensively in your code. 

However, I would still want to clarify the CWE (Cryptographic Weaknesses) mentioned in your question, as they could potentially be present in the libraries you mentioned, or indirectly through configurations used in your code. 

Here is how the list might look:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-256: Cryptographic Modes to be used in Cryptography should be validated to ensure that the necessary cryptographic operations can be performed effectively.",
    "vulnerable_method": "The class name and method name of a vulnerable code is not mentioned in the code provided",
    "vulnerable_code": "The code snippets are not provided in the provided code",
    "description": "Incorrect usage of cryptographic operations can cause data corruption or security vulnerabilities, so it is necessary to validate the cryptographic modes used in the cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use validated and approved cryptographic modes in your cryptographic operations."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Software uses unnecessary cryptographic module.",
    "vulnering_class": "Unable to identify class. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_method": "Unable to identify method. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Unable to identify code snippet. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "description": "The software uses cryptographic functions that are not necessary for its functionality.",
    "recommendation": "Remove unnecessary cryptographic modules and use only necessary ones."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-297: Software uses cryptographic modules or algorithms inappropriately.",
    "vulnering_class": "Unable to identify class. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_method": "Unable to identify method. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Unable to identify code snippet. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "description": "The software uses cryptographic modules or algorithms in a way that does not match its security requirements.",
    "recommendation": "Use cryptographic modules or algorithms according to the required security level."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-321: The software uses a standard API function with the wrong number of arguments, which causes it to behave in unexpected ways.",
    "vulnering_class": "Unable to identify class. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_method": "Unable to identify method. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Unable to identify code snippet. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "description": "The software uses a standard API function with the wrong number of arguments, which causes it to behave in unexpected ways.",
    "recommendation": "Check the usage of standard API functions and make sure the number of arguments is correct."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inactive or vulnerable functions allow a user to provide input that is not expected by the function, causing it to provide an incorrect result or code execution.",
    "vulnering_class": "Unable to identify class. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_method": "Unable to identify method. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Unable to identify code snippet. Possibly related code is absent.",
    "description": "Inactive or vulnerable functions allow a user to provide input that is not expected by the function.",
    "recommendation": "Make sure the functions are active and are secure against input that does not meet the expected format or value."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: The software uses a vulnerable cryptographic algorithm which is easily exploited.",
