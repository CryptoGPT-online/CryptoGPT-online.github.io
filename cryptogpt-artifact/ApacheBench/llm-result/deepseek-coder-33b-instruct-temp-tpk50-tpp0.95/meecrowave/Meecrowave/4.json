Below are some potential security issues found in the provided code.

1. Misuse: CWE-256 - Unprotected APIs Vulnerability (Password in Configuration File)
   Vulnerable method: getProperties, getKeyPass
   Vulnerable code:
```java
String value = config.getProperty(prop);
```
   Description: The configuration file might contain sensitive information (such as passwords) in plain text. This is dangerous as if the configuration file is compromised, the passwords will be exposed.
   Recommendation: Do not store sensitive information in the configuration files. Instead, use secure vaults or environment variables to store sensitive information.

2. Misuse: CWE-295 - Improper Certificate Validation
   Vulnerable method: SSLContext::getInstance, SSLSocketFactory::getSocketFactory
   Vulnerable code:
```java
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
SSLSession sslSession = connection.getClientSession();
```
   Description: The code uses SSL for secure communication. However, it does not validate the certificate provided by the server, which may cause MITM (Man-in-the-middle) attacks.
   Recommendation: Validate the certificate provided by the server to ensure it is valid and issued by a trusted authority.

3. Misuse: CWE-259 - Missing Dynamic Initialization
   Vulnerable method: ClassLoader getInitialClassLoader, ApplicationLoader getLoader, ClassLoader getClassLoader
   Vulnerable code:
```java.
ContextClassLoader classLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
ClassLoader classLoader = ServletContext.getLoader().getClassLoader();
ClassLoader classLoader = getInitialClassLoader();
```
   Description: The code may not have proper initialization for classLoader. If not properly initialized, it could lead to unintended behavior.
   Recommendation: Initialise the classLoader before using it to avoid any misbehaviour.

4. Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
   Vulnerable method: Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("DESede");
   Vulnderable code:
```java
SecretKeySpec key = new SecretKeySpec(new byte[]{(byte) 0x76, (ete. 0xba, (byte) 0x39, ..., (byte) 0x12, (byte) 0x17, (byte) 0xac, (byte) 0x77, (byte) 0x39, (byte) 0x19}, "DESede");
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("DESede");
c.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
String result = new String(c.doFinal(cipherText), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
Description: The code is using DESede algorithm for cryptographic operations. DESede was considered vulnerable in 2012 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
   Recommendation: Use a safer algorithm such as AES for cryptographic operations.

These are preliminary issues. Further testing and analysis would be required to confirm these issues and potential other vulnerabilities.
