        "description": "The `getInstance()` method in this code is used to create a `Cipher` object with the transformation algorithm specified by `TRANSFORMATION`. The transformation is "DESede" which is known to be vulnerable to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using DESede, use a more secure algorithm like AES or RSA. Also consider using a different cryptographic library that has been thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities."
