    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "org.apache.openejb.cipher.StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt()",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION)",
    "description": "The use of the DES encryption algorithm is a risky choice. It is no longer considered safe for encryption. This code uses DES for password encryption which is known to be susceptible to attacks. Moreover, it uses DESede, which is a 3DES (3-way DES) encryption algorithm but the transformation string is specified as DESede when the SecretKeySpec is initialized. This is not correct and will cause an exception to be thrown.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a safer cryptographic algorithm, like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest Shamtimate and Adleman)."
