        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The code utilizes the DESede (3DES) algorithm for encryption which is known to be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, including brute force and timing attacks. DESede is no longer acceptable for protecting data under federal government cybersecurity requirements."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys",
        "description": "The encryption employs a hardcoded key which is a security risk as it makes the encryption vulnerable to attackers who, upon discovering the key, can easily decrypt the data. The hardcoded key is shared among all users and is easily retrieved if the system or codebase is compromised."

    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Transformation Algorithm Specification",
        "description": "The transformation string specified as 'DESede' is insecure and should be replaced with a more secure transformation scheme like 'DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding', alongside the use of a secure, randomly generated key."
