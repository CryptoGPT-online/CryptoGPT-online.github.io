The code does not contain any explicit use of a cryptographic algorithm vulnerabilities according to the CWEs (CWE-256, 295, 297, 321, 326, 327, 338, 547, 650, 757, 759 and 760). The algorithm used is AES, a well-known and secure encryption algorithm.

It uses the SHA-256 algorithm for hash calculation, but this is not a problem as long as the hashed passwords are not used for security purposes, like authentication or password verification. The hash is merely a protection against accidental exposure and is not stored as such, rather used to create the encryption keys for the actual data.

The `aesEncrypt` and `aesDecrypt` methods use the javax.crypto.Cipher class for encryption and decryption respectively. These methods are using the AES encryption algorithm in Cipher.getInstance().

The `getSecretKeySpec` method uses a 16-bit version of the hashed password to use as the encryption key.

The `byteToHex` method converts a byte array into a hexadecimal String representation for storage and the `hexToByte` method does the opposite, it converts hexadecimal into a byte array.

The `loadProperties` method loads properties from a file URL. This method just provides a way to load Properties from a file so there's no obvious issue with it.

However, it's worth mentioning the `secureHash` method is using SHA-256, which is considered a widely used cryptographic algorithm, but if the use of SHA-256 is not necessary, it could be changed to a more secure algorithm. The same goes for the AES encryption. If these were not intended to be used for security purposes, the usage could also be revised.
