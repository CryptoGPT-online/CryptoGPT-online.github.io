    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The AES algorithm's encryption strength depends on the key length which could be lower than 256 bits, and the code uses SHA-256 for hashing which may be considered weak."

{
    "misuse": "CWE-256: Use of Password Hash Instead of a KDF",
    "description": "The code does not use a Key Derivation Function (KDF) resulting in the derivation of the same key for the same password each time the function is called."

    "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)",
    "description": "A weak random number generator is used for master password generation, resulting in predictable keys."

    "misuse": "CWE-297: Unhandled Exceptional Conditions",
    "description": "The code ignores exceptions without appropriate error handling, especially in cryptographic operations like 'getMasterKey' and 'aesDecrypt'."

    "description": "The 'aesEncrypt' function does not use a random salt for encryption, making it more susceptible to attacks."
