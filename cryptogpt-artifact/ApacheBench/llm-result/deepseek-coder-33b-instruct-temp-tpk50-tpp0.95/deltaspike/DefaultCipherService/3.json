1. A weak random number generator is used for the master password generation. This is a common mistake and results in predictable keys.
2. The user password (if used) is not scrubbed properly. Avoiding this issue would require stringizing of some way.
3. The "secure" hash function used is SHA-256, which is known to be vulnerable to collisions and this could lead to vulnerability. Consider using a stronger algorithm for the master hash.
4. The "aesEncrypt" function does not use a random salt for the encryption. This could result in vulnerability. Adding a salt is a recommended practice.
