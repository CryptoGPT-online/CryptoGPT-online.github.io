You seem to be looking for specific cryptographic usage and insecure practices in this Java source code. However, the code seems to be a system initialization class and does not contain specific cryptographic implementations.

It's difficult to detect specific cryptographic issues in this code because it doesn't use the cryptographic methods directly. Instead, it seems to handle encryption/decryption through a custom implementation (encryption/decryption is done through "obfuscate", "deobfuscate" , "encrypt" and "decrypt" methods), which uses cryptographic APIs, namely `java.security.MessageDigest`, `java.security.SecureRandom`, `javax.crypto.Cipher`, `java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets`.

If you want to check for potential vulnerabilities of cryptographic operations, you would need to look at places where these operations are called, and ensure they are done correctly and securely. In this code, the operations are used for some string processing (encryption/decryption of strings, conversion to hashes, etc.), which is not inherently vulnerable. However, it does not have any logic for handling sensitive data such as passwords or authentication tokens, so it does not need to be considered for general cryptographic security analysis.

If you want to check for general security issues in Java, you could check against the OWASP Java Security Guide and the SECSEC (SECure-SECurity) guidelines. However, these are more general security guidelines for Java applications, and they do not explicitly refer to cryptography, as cryptographic operations are usually implemented correctly and are not a security risk unless they're used incorrectly.

So, your question "Does this code has misuses related to Java crypto API?" seems to have a lack of a concrete point, given that the code is initializing and configuring itself, and does not have any cryptographic operations itself.
