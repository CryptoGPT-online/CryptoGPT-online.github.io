The provided code is a Java implementation of the DES3 CBC SHA1 KD encryption algorithm used in Kerberos.

Misuses/Security issues:

1. No SSL/TLS certificate verification for secure connection. The code seems to communicate with a server which does not have SSL/TLS certificate verification. This is a security flaw and susceptible to attacks. It can be fixed by implementing certificate verification during SSL/TLS communication.

2. Hardcoded password in the code. The code may include hardcoded passwords or secrets. It is important to remove hardcoded secrets from the code and use secure storage to retrieve secrets.

3. No logging of security-relevant events and failures. The code does not seem to have any logging mechanism for security-relevant events and failures. Implementing proper logging can be very beneficial for debugging and understanding the behavior of the system.

4. Use of Cryptographic Modes not supported by the Java Cryptographic APIs. The DES3 CBC mode is not supported by the java.security.Cipher class in the Java Cryptographic APIs. 

5. Use of DESede algorithm for encryption. DESede is a weak encryption algorithm and it is susceptible to attacks. It is recommended to use stronger encryption algorithms.
