Security issues found:

1. Usage of DES encryption algorithm: CWE-327.

   Misuse Code: `cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/NoPadding");`

   Description: DES is known to be susceptible to various attacks (including exhaustive search attacks) and should not be used for security-critical purposes.

   Recommendation: Use a stronger encryption algorithm, preferably AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

2. No error handling in case of GeneralSecurityException.

   Misuse Code: `catch ( GeneralSecurityException nsae )`

   Description: When a GeneralSecurityException occurs, the program just prints the stack trace and continues. This could potentially lead to unhandled exceptions and unpredictable behavior.

   Recommendation: Consider returning an error instead of continuing execution, or at least logging the error and continuing.

3. Not using secure random for generating random bytes.

   Misuse Code: `getRandomBytes( getConfounderLength() );`

   Description: The use of Random class for generating random bytes is not secure.

   Recommendation: Use SecureRandom instead.

4. Use of DES/CBC/NoPadding as Cipher algorithm.

   Misuse Code: `cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/NoPadding");`

   Description: The padding mode NoPadding is susceptible to padding oracles attacks.

   Recommendation: Use padding modes such as PKCS5 padding, depending upon the requirements of the application.

5. Inadequate key size

   Misuse Code: `SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec( keyBytes, "DES" );`

   Description: SecretKeySpec is used to represent symmetric keys, the actual key length (10 years ago it was 8 bytes, now it's generally 16 bytes, i.e. 128 bits) should be appropriate depending on the algorithm, it's less than the expected 8 bytes for DES.

   Recommendation: Make sure to use appropriate key size based on the chosen encryption algorithm.

6. No IV used for DES encryption

   Misuse Code: `cipher.init( Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, paramSpec );`

   Description: In certain modes, the use of IV (Initial Vector) is recommended, otherwise, the cipher may be vulnerable to attack.

   Recommendation: Use IV for such modes.

Please note that these issues can be fixed based on the severity of impact and the risk.
