    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_method": "org.apache.directory.server.kerberos.shared.crypto.encryption.DesCbcCrcEncryption.getEncryptedData",
   "vulnerable_code": "byte[] encryptedData = encrypt( paddedDataBytes, key.getKeyValue() );",
    "description": "The code uses DES encryption without any cryptographic parameter to encryption function and hardcoded IV, which is weak cryptographic algorithm. IV (Initialization Vector) does not change in subsequent Encryptions of the same plaintext. A predictable IV will allow attackers to reveal information about the key used for encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographic library which provides cryptographic algorithms that are widely accepted and tested, and consider using Cryptography for Java (CJA) ECC, CJA SEC, or Java Secure Coding (JSEC) API in your application."
