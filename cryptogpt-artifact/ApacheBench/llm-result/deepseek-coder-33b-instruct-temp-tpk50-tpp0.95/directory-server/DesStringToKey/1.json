Security issues and their corresponding code snippets within the provided Java code are as follows:

1. The algorithm used for the DES (Data Encryption System) does not have the appropriate Cryptographic Algorithm validation (CWE-327, Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). It directly uses the DES algorithm and does not have any mechanism to validate the integrity and secureness of the used algorithms.
  
Misuse details and code snippets:

```json
{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "getKey methods",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/CBC/NoPadding\");",
    "description": "The Cipher object is being created and the method uses the DES algorithm without any mechanism to ensure the integrity and secureness of the used algorithm",
    "recommendation": "Use a proven cryptographic algorithm. Algorithms that are not secure should be avoided whenever possible. If the use of a non-secure algorithm is absolutely necessary, the code should ensure it has been tested thoroughly and is known to be secure."
}
```

Please note that the use of the DES algorithm is known to be susceptible to various attacks, such as DES cracking. Therefore, it should be replaced with a robust algorithm.

Kindly note that this is a simplified analysis, there might be other potential security issues not listed here. You should consider using a comprehensive security analysis tool to evaluate the code.
