    "vuelnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CTS/NoPadding\")",
    "description": "The code is using the AES/CTS/NoPadding encryption mode, which is susceptible to the Cryptographic Trapdoor One (CTO) vulnerability. It could allow an attacker to manipulate the encrypted data in such way that the integrity check does not fail, but the integrity of the data is compromised. ",
    "recommendation": "Consider using an encryption mode other than CTS, or implement CTS mode manually in a way that eliminates the risk of the CTO problem."
