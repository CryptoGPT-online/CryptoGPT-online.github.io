I will provide the corrected JSON below.

In the first misuse, the key spec in the SecretKeySpec constructor is incorrect. It is written as "ARCFORC" instead of "HmacMD5" which would cause an error in the program.

In the second misuse, the key spec is correct, but the misuse category does not seem to be applicable in this context.

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "HmacMd5Checksum.calculateChecksum",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKey sk = new SecretKeySpec( key, \"ARCFOREAD\" );",
    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used is hardcoded as 'ARCFOREAD', which is known as being 'broken or risky', instead of the intended 'HmacMD5'",
    "recommendation": "The code should be modified to dynamically use the correct cryptographic algorithm based on the specific requirements and security policies."
}]
```

There seems to be only one misuse here, the incorrect key spec is causing an error. This misuse needs to be fixed to ensure the program works as expected.
