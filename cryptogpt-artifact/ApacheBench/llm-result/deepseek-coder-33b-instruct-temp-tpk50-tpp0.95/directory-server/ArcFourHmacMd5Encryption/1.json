    "recommendation": "Consider switching to a modern, secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which is widely accepted as a strong cryptographic algorithm. Also consider updating the provider implementation, as the provider may not provide the latest and better cryptographic algorithms."
