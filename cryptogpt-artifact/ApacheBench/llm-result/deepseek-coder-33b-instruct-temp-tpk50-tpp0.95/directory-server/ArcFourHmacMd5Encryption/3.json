Issue 1: RC4 algorithm is vulnerable to numerous attacks and it's no longer considered cryptographic to use it for modern purposes. It should be replaced with a more secure algorithm (e.g. AES).

Issue 2: The security of any cryptographic algorithm relies not only on the algorithm, but also on using the keys in a secure manner. It's important to store keys in a secure manner, and ensure that keys are never stored as strings or in a format that can be easily read (i.e., passwords stored in the clear is a bad idea).

Issue 3: In `getEncryptedData()`, the returned `EncryptedData` object has the encryption type and version as defined in the class, but the cipher is just the plain text. It seems the actual encryption process is not performed at all.

Issue 4: The `calculateIntegrity()` method calculates a MAC (Message Authentication Code) using HmacMD5, but there is no signature in the `EncryptedData` returned by `getEncryptedData()`. This makes integrity checks ineffective.
