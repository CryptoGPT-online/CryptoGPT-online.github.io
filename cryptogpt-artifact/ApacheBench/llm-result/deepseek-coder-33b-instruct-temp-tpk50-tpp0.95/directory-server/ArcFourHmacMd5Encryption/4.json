The provided code is a part of Apache Directory Server Kerberos implementation which uses RC4 encryption and MD5 HMAC for integrity checking. There are multiple security issues in this implementation which need to be addressed:

1. The usage of RC4 cryptographic algorithm for encrypting and decrypting data which is known to be vulnerable to attacks.
2. The usage of MD5 hash algorithm as a MAC for integrity checking.
3. The confidentiality of the keys used for encryption and MAC computation are not properly protected.
