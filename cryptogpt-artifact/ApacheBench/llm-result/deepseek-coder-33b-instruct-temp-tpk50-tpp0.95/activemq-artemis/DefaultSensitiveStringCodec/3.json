The security risks in the provided code are mainly related to the cryptographic algorithms used in the Blowfish and PBKDF2 algorithms. Here is a brief analysis and proposed fixes:

**Blowfish Algorithm**
1. There is a hard-coded key string in the DefaultSensitiveStringCodec.BlowfishAlgorithm class: "clusterpassword". This key is not necessary hard-coded, and it should be made configurable. If this key is compromised, the whole encryption and decryption of the data will be vulnerable.
2. The "Blowfish" is a weak cryptographic algorithm. It is not secure and has been known to be vulnerable to attacks.

The solution for the first issue is to remove the hard-coded key, and instead, use a configurable key.

The solution for the second issue is to use a stronger cryptographic algorithm. You may consider using a higher level of encryption such as AES or a cryptographic library that provides a higher level of security.

**PBKDF2 Algorithm**
1. The iterations are hard-coded to 1024. This means that the algorithm will process the input a fixed number of times. This may not be optimal in terms of security. The number of iterations should be chosen based on the computational cost of the system.
2. The length of the salt is hard-coded to 32. This means that the salt is a fixed length. This could be improved to be randomly generated and stored alongside the password.
3. There is no mechanism to verify user input against the stored password. The `verify` method should be implemented to compare the input with the stored password.

The first issue can be fixed by dynamically determining the number of iterations based on the computational capabilities of the system. 

The second and third issues can be addressed by implementing the `verify` method correctly and ensuring that the salt is randomly generated and stored along with the password.

Please note that the above suggestions are general and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints.

If possible, consider using a proven, well-tested library for encryption instead of implementing these algorithms yourself.
