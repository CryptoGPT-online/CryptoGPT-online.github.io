The code doesn't appear to have any security issues regarding cryptographic use of APIs. However, as a general recommendation, you might consider whether the random generator used in your application is suitable for the security context. 

Here is the JSON format response related to cryptographic use:

```json
[{"misuse": "Use of Random in Cryptography", "vulnerable_method": "All methods in RandomUtil class","vulnerable_code": "All methods in RandomUtil class","description": "Random class is used in cryptographic operations such as generating keys and nonces. However, the used Random class does not provide cryptographic-quality randomness.
The default Random class in Java uses a system time for the seed of the random number generator, which means that if you use the random class for generating cryptographic keys or nonces, you are not generating randomness and you are susceptible to predicting the output of the generator, if you have knowledge of the system or the application.", "recommendation": "For cryptographic use of random, consider using the class java.security.SecureRandom. It uses system entropy (such as the timing of key presses) in addition to system time, to provide cryptographic randomness. In certain situations, if deterministic behavior is needed, a specified seed can be used."}]
