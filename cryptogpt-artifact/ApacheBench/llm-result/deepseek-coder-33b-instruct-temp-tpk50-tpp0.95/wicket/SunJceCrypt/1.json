The code provided is a class for encryption and decryption of strings using Sun's Java Cryptographic Extensions (JCE). However, it seems like there are no actual security issues detected in the provided code. 

Here, the PBEWithMD5AndDES method is used for encryption and decryption, which is a well-known and widely accepted cryptographic algorithm. This algorithm is also provided by Sun's JCE, so there should be no issues with compatibility and availability.

One thing to consider, as per the Cryptographic Failure in the Code and Cryptographic Errors, Outs and Unknowns paper by Snyder (Nataraj, Banerjenehan), this code currently uses hard-coded Salt values which should be changed to random each time instead of hard coding in the code. This is not a major issue but a security improvement.

Overall, this class looks fine for use with default encryption method (PBEWithMD5AndDES) and hard coded salt values. It's always a good idea to use the most secure and robust algorithms and practices for cryptographic operations, but they should always be chosen according to the specific requirements of the application and environment.

So, the code provided is safe and there is no immediate issue to report.
