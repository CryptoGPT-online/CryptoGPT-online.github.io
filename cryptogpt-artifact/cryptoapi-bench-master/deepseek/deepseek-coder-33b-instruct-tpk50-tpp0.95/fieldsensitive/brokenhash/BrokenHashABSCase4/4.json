Misuse: 
   Misuse Type: Use of Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)

Vulnerable Code:
```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);
```

Description: 
   The code is using the MessageDigest class with the instance of the crypto algorithm (crypto). The crypto algorithm used, "MD2", is a weak hash algorithm which is not recommended for new applications anymore. It's also known to have vulnerabilities like collision problems.

Recommendation:
   To fix the issue, replace the use of "MD2" with a secure cryptographic algorithm like "SHA-256", "SHA-3", or "SHA3-256" etc. You can replace the instance creation with the selected algorithm.

Here is a solution:

```java
public void encrypt(String str, String passedAlgo) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, InvalidKeyException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException {
        if(passedAlgo.isEmpty()){
            passedAlgo = crypto;
        }

        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        md.update(str.getBytes());
        System.out.println(md.digest());

    }
```
