        "description": "MD2 is a weak and obsolete hash algorithm. It is not considered secure anymore. Using it for cryptographic operations could result in security vulnerabilities. You should use stronger algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-3 or BLAKE2B. Additionally, it's good practice to select a hash algorithm that is appropriate for your specific use case to avoid potential vulnerabilities.",
