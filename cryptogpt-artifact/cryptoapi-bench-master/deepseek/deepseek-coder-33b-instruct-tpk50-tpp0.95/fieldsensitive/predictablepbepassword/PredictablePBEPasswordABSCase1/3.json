Misuse: Weak Crypto Algorithm

Vulnerable Code:

```java
pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(passedPassword.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);
```

Description: The code is using PBEKeySpec with a very low iteration count (11010). This number is considered too low by many sources, which means it is easily guessable by an attacker and may not provide the same level of security as higher iteration counts.

Recommendation: Consider raising the iteration count to at least 1000000 (1,000,000). This is the minimum recommended for PBKDF2.
