The provided code has a few issues related to cryptography. 

1. The use of IDEA as an encryption algorithm (defaultAlgo) in C6 class is weak and not recommended for encryption purposes. It is a deprecated encryption algorithm with a small key size.

2. The defaultAlgo is not being used during encryption. Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo) will create a new instance with the default algorithm, which is passed in the constructor of C6 class, but it is not being used during encryption. The algorithm should be based on the passedAlgo.

Here is the response in JSON format:
