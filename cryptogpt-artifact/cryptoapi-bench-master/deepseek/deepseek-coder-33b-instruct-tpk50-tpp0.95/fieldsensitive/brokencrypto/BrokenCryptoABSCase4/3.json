  "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used here, RC2, is considered weak and shouldn't be used in any modern system. It's being used without a key which means it's using a system-generated key that might be weak, not a key generated by the user. Additionally, the encryption algorithm is not specified when using the encrypt method, so the default algorithm is used.",
  "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES, and provide a key for the encryption. It's also important to always specify the encryption algorithm when calling the encrypt method. The default algorithm should not be used if a specific algorithm is required."}]
