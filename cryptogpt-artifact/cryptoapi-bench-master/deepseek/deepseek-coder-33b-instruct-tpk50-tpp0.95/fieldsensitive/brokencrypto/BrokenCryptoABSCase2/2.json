        "description": "Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher that can operate in three modes: Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), and Output Feedback (OFB). When no key size is specified, it uses a default key size of 128 bits. However, Blowfish keys smaller than 32 bits are considered to be weak. It is recommended to use a key size of at least 128 bits for Blowfish encryption. The code does not specify the key size, which could be a security risk.",
        "recommendation": "Specify a key size when generating the key. For example, you can use keyGen.init(128) to generate a 128-bit key, or keyGen.init(256) for a 256-bit key. The recommended key size for Blowfish encryption is at least 128 bits."
