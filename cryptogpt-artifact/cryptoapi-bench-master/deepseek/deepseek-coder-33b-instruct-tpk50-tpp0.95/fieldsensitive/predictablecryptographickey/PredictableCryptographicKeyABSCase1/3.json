Misuses:
1. Insecure Cryptographic Storage of Secret: 
Misuse Type: Broken Crypto Algorithm
Vulnerable Code:
```java
byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes("UTF-8");
```
Description: The key is being stored as a byte array using UTF-8 encoding which may not be secure. UTF-8 is commonly used for string representation, but the original key may not be stored in a UTF-8 encoded string. If the key is not correctly handled or encoded/stored insecurely, it can lead to various vulnerabilities.
Recommendation: Use a secure method of securely storing the encryption key. The KeyStore facilities, which are provided by the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), can be used for secure key storage.

2. Insecure use of Cipher: 
Misuse Type: Broken Crypto Algorithm
Vulnerable Code:
```java
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,keySpec);
```
Description: The Cipher object is being initialized for encryption using a SecretKeySpec. If the Cipher object is not initialized correctly, it can lead to incorrect or unexpected results. The Cipher object should be initialized for encryption and decryption. 
Recommendation: Ensure that the Cipher object is correctly initialized before any encryption or decryption operation.

3. Insecure use of getKey method: 
Misuse Type: Misconfiguration
Vulnerable Code:
```java
if(passKey == null) {
    crypto = new Co("defaultkey");
}
```
Description: The `getKey` method is used to retrieve keys from a system property. If the system property is not correctly set or is set incorrectly, it can lead to an incorrect key being used for encryption and decryption.
Recommendation: Ensure that the system properties are correctly set and secured to prevent insecure use of keys. 

4. Insecure use of getKey method: 
Misuse Type: Misconfiguration
Vulnerable Code:
```java
byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes("UTF-8");
```
Description: The `key` is being converted to a byte array using UTF-8 encoding. This can lead to issues if the key is not correctly encoded or if the key contains characters that cannot be represented in UTF-8.
Recommendation: Ensure that the key is correctly encoded before being used for encryption and decryption.

Please review these findings with a security expert to ensure any recommendations are accurate and safe to implement.
