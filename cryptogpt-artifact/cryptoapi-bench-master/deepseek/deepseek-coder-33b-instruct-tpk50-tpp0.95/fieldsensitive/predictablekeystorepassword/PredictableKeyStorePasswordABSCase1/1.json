The provided code includes a misuse of the Cryptographic API:

1. Insecure Use of Hardcoded Cryptographic Key: The hardcoded cryptographic key is provided as a default value for the method parameter 'passedKey' and later used in the KeyStore.load method. This is a severe security vulnerability, as it opens up the application to potential cryptographic attacks.

```
    passedKey = defKey;
    //...
    ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), passedKey.toCharArray());
```

2. Unverified TLS/SSL Certificates: The application loads TLS/SSL certificates from an URL without verifying them, which can expose the application to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

```
    cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com");
    ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), passedKey.toCharArray());
```

Recommended Fixes:

1. Secure the Key: Instead of using a hardcoded key, use a secure and randomly generated key. 

2. Verify TLS/SSL Certificates: Always verify the TLS/SSL certificates to avoid MitM attacks. 

Please note: The exact recommendation for these fixes may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.
