This code snippet is utilizing the KeyStore API to load a keystore from a URL, which is a secure method for storing and managing cryptographic keys. However, it's misusing the KeyStore API in a way that could lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

Misuse Type: Insecure Default Keys
Vulnerable Code:
```java
passedKey = defKey;

String type = "JKS";
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);
cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com");
ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), passedKey.toCharArray());
```
Description:
The misuse here is that the KeyStore is loaded with a default key which is hardcoded within the code, instead of being dynamically generated or even fetched from a secure environment variable. This key is "changeit", which is the default key in a new JKS keystore. The use of default keys exposes the application to risk if the keystore is leaked or attacked.

Recommendation:
Instead of hard-coding the key, the key should be fetched from a secure environment variable or a secure configuration file. If the key is not known at compile time, it should be fetched dynamically at runtime from a secure source. For example, a secure password vault, or an external service like AWS Secrets Manager.
