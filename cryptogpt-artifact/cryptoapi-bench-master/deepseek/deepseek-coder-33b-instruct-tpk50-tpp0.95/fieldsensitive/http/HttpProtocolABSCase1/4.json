The code does not contain any cryptographic issues, but it has a security vulnerability related to URL handling. 

If a malicious attacker can control the input to the method1, they could potentially cause a malformed URL exception to be thrown. This could potentially be used to execute a denial-of-service attack by causing the program to crash due to an unhandled exception.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "URL Handling Misuse",
    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(passedURL)",
    "description": "If the passedURL is controlled by an attacker, they could potentially cause a malformed URL exception. This could potentially be used to execute a denial-of-service attack.",
    "recommendation": "You should validate the URL before using it. You can use URL.toURI() method to verify it. Make sure to handle MalformedURLException properly."
  }
]
```
