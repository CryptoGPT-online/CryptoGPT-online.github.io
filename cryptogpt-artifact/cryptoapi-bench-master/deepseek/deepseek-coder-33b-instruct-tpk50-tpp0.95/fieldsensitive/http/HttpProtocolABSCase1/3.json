        "description": "The code accepts user-provided input to create a URL object which can lead to uncontrolled input. If the input is not properly validated, an attacker can craft a URL string which, when parsed, can result in unexpected behavior such as leaking local files, performing redirections to malicious websites, etc.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that all inputs passed to the URL class are sanitized and are not user-controlled. A recommended practice is to use a whitelist-based approach to validate the user input. Also, use the `new URL(String protocol, String host, String file)` constructor to avoid a potentially dangerous URL construction with String concatenation."
