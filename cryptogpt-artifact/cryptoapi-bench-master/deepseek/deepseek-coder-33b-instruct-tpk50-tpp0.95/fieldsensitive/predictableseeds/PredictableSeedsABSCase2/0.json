The code provided appears to have multiple misuses related to cryptographic operations, particularly related to secure random number generation. Here is the list of misuses:

1. The seed value for SecureRandom is always the same - 100. This could potentially allow an attacker to predict the generated random numbers.

2. The passedSeed value is overwritten within the method1() function, which could lead to unexpected behavior in your application.

The recommended changes include:

1. Changing the seed value for SecureRandom to a more secure random value, such as the output of a strong random number generator.

2. Not overwriting the passedSeed value within the method1() function, or using the passedSeed as the seed if it's a desired behavior.

Here is how the updated code might look:

```java
public class P2 {
    C2 crypto;
    public P2() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
        byte seed = 100;
        crypto = new C2(seed);
        crypto.method1((byte) 20);
    }
}

class C2 {
    byte defSeed;

    public C2(byte seed) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        defSeed = seed;
    }

    public void method1(byte passedSeed) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, InvalidKeyException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException {

        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

Please remember to consider these changes based on your application's specific needs and requirements for random number generation.
