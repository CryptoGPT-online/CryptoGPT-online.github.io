The code has two main issues. The first is that the passedSeed is being reassigned with defSeed within the method1 method of C2 class. This is essentially overriding the passed value for the secure random number generator. Secondly, SecureRandom constructor is deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 11. The reason is, it can be potentially weak and may not generate cryptographically strong random numbers.

Here is the JSON response with the issues:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Unsecure Cryptographic Operation",
        "vulnerable_code": "passedSeed = defSeed;",
        "description": "Passed seed is overridden by the class-level seed variable. This could make the use of secure random generator ineffective.",
        "recommendation": "The assignment operation of passedSeed with defSeed should be eliminated. The passed value should be used directly."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Deprecated or Insufficient Cryptographic Algorithms",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});",
        "description": "Deprecated SecureRandom constructor is used. This may lead to the generation of weak cryptographic keys and less secure random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Use the other overloaded constructors of SecureRandom or use a non-deprecated constructor."
    }
]
```
