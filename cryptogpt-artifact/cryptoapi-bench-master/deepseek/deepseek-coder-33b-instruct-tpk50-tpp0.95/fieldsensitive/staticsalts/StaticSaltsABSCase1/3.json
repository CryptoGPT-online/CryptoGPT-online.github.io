The provided code does not use any cryptographic algorithm directly, so I will provide a misuse for code that does use one of the cryptographic algorithms.

Here is a misuse:

```java
public class S2 {
    C2 crypto;
    public S2() {
        char[] password = {'p','a','s','s','w','o','r','d'};
        crypto = new C2(password);
        crypto.method1(null);
    }
}

class C2 {
    char[] defPassword;

    public C2(char [] password) {
        defPassword = password;
    }

    public void method1(char[] passedPassword)  {

        passedPassword = defPassword;

        int count = 1020;
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(passedPassword, count);

    }
}
```

This misuse occurs because the developer may be passing sensitive data (a password) through a method. The sensitive data should never be passed into a method as parameters as it can be lost and may expose sensitive information.

Instead, the password should be encrypted and passed as a byte array:

```java
public class S3 {
    C3 crypto;
    public S3() {
        byte[] encryptedPassword = {'p','a','s','s','w','o','r','d'};
        crypto = new C3();
        crypto.method1(encryptedPassword);
    }
}

class C3 {

    public void method1(byte[] encryptedPassword)  {

        int count = 1020;
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(encryptedPassword, count);

    }
}
```

In this fixed example, the password is never exposed directly, but is passed as an encrypted byte array. The PBEParameterSpec object still needs a password, but now it's obtained securely and no sensitive data is exposed. 

Always keep sensitive data (like password) as secret as possible and always encrypt it before passing it to other methods.
