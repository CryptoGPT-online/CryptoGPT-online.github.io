The provided code does not have any direct misuses of the cryptographic API. However, there are several potential issues that can be considered:

1. The method `method1` receives a `passedSalt` as parameter and assigns `defSalt` to it which is the class member. This can be a mistake because it means `defSalt` will be overwritten and not persisted.
2. The code is using a single byte for the salt which can be easily cracked by brute-force attacks.
3. The number of iterations (1020) for PBE is high, it might slow down the process and can potentially be reduced for stronger security requirements.

In general, it's important to make sure that the salt and number of iterations are selected securely, and the salt is not the same for all inputs (in this case it's the same for each instance of the `C1` class).

Here is the JSON response considering these misuses:

        "recommendation": "Use a secure random salt of at least 8 bytes for added security."
