I analyzed the provided code and found the following misuses of cryptographic API:

1. Null or empty salt: In method1 of class C1, passedSalt is set to defSalt but defSalt contains one byte value which is not null or empty. This might cause a false positive for cryptographic API misuse.

2. Hard-coded salt: The salt is hard-coded in the constructor of C1, and it's only one byte long. This is not a secure way to manage salt as it provides no extra entropy for the algorithm.

Here's a suggestion:

1. Generate random salt using a SecureRandom.

2. Provide enough entropy for your salt. The salt should be unique for each password and be at least as long as the hash. 

JSON format response:
