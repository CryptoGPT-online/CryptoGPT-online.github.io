The code provided does not contain any misuses related to CWE-256, 295, 297, 321, 326, 327, 338, 547, 650, 757, 759 and 760. However, there are some things that should be considered for better coding practices:

1. Unnecessary use of `IllegalBlockSizeException`, `BadPaddingException`, `InvalidKeyException`, `UnsupportedEncodingException` and `NoSuchAlgorithmException` in the constructor of the `C1` class. The exceptions thrown by these methods are not used for error handling, but for indicating that a method may throw these exceptions.

2. The variable `passedCount` is passed to the constructor of `PBEParameterSpec` before its value is assigned. This may cause a `NullPointerException`.

Here is the revised code:

```java
public class L1 {
    C1 crypto;
    public L1() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException {
        crypto = new C1(20);
        crypto.method1(0);
    }
}

class C1 {
    int defcount;

    public C1(int count) {
        defcount = count;
    }

    public void method1(int passedCount) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, InvalidKeyException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException {
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        byte[] salt = new byte[32];
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        random.nextBytes(salt);

        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, passedCount);
    }
}
```

In this revised code, I have removed the unnecessary exceptions thrown by the methods, and I've corrected the order of operations in the `method1` so that `passedCount` is properly assigned before being passed to `PBEParameterSpec`.
