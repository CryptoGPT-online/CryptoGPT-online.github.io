The code you provided is using a Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode for encryption, which is not considered safe and has multiple vulnerabilities such as the IV not being random and reuse. This could lead to security issues such as replay attacks or the possibility of the ciphertext being recovered when plaintext is known.

Misuse: Unsafe usage of PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm
Vulnerable_code:

```
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
byte[] salt = new byte[32];
random.nextBytes(salt);
pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt,passedCount);
```

Description: The code is using a hard-coded value `32` for the size of the salt in bytes. This makes the code not scalable and makes it easy for an attacker to brute force the salt value.

Recommendation: The salt size should be a configuration value and should be randomly generated for every encryption operation. 

Misuse: Reusing of the same Initialization Vector (IV)
Vulnerable_code:

```
pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt,passedCount);
```

Description: The PBEParameterSpec is being used with a count of `passedCount`, which is being reassigned to `defCount`. This means that the same IV (with the same count value) is being used for multiple encryption operations.

Recommendation: An IV should not be reused. It should be randomly generated each time a new encryption operation is performed.

Note:
The code is generating a salt and an IV using `SecureRandom` which is a good practice, but the salt and IV size are not configurable and are being fixed to a specific value, which could lead to security issues.

Please consider using a key management system or HSM to securely generate and manage cryptographic keys and IVs.
