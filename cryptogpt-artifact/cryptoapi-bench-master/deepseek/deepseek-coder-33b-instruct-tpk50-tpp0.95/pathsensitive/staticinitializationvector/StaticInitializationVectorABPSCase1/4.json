        "description": "The AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding is the most common mode of operation for CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), where AES is used as the encryption algorithm and PKCS5Padding is used for padding. The main issue with this method is that it is not as secure as it appears. The AES with CBC is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which allows the attacker to decrypt the ciphertext by sending it through the system and see if it gets accepted.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using an authenticated encryption mode with AES and CBC (e.g., AES/GCM/NoPadding), which will provide confidentiality and integrity. For instance: Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\"). It's important to note, however, that this might also affect your code because GCM doesn't support NoPadding unlike CBC does."
