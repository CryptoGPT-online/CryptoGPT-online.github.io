[{"misuse": "Initialization vector not correctly generated", "vulnerable_code": "bytes = new byte[16];\nsr.nextBytes(bytes);\nIvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);", "description": "Using a fixed size array can lead to predictable IVs being created. This can lead to security problems. A misuse of the code can cause a pattern of IVs that can be easily discovered and used by an attacker to decrypt the message. It is also not necessary to create a new array and generate a new IV every time the go method is called. A fixed size array or a static array can be reused.", "recommendation": "Use a method to generate an IV that ensures randomness. A simple way is to generate random data, but beware of the security implications. AES has a block size of 128 bits, so the IV should also be 128 bits or larger. For CBC mode, you should also use a secure random number generator to generate the IV."}]
