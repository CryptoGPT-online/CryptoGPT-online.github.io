This code is not secure because of the following reasons:

1. Insecurely Initialized SecureRandom: The SecureRandom object is used to generate a random string to be used as the default key for the keystore. However, since no specific seed is provided to the SecureRandom, it's not cryptographically secure, which could lead to weak random number generation and potential exploitation of weak random number generators.

2. Hardcoded Key: The default key is hardcoded as "changeit". While this is the default keystore password, it's also well-known and insecure. Using a hardcoded key like this exposes the key to attackers.

3. Insecurely Loaded Keystore: The keystore is loaded from a URL. While this URL is "https://www.google.com", which is a valid URL, it doesn't point to a keystore file, which makes this approach problematic. Moreover, loading from a URL may not be secure as the URL may be intercepted.

4. No Encryption/Decryption Code: There is no encryption or decryption code provided in the code. While keystores can contain keys and certificates, it's important to protect the integrity and confidentiality of these elements by using encryption.

5. No Error Handling: There is no error handling in the code. Errors should be appropriately handled to avoid unexpected behavior.
