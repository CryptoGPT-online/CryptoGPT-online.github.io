This code is misusing the `KeyStore.load` method in multiple ways:

1. It's using a hard-coded default key "changeit" to load the keystore. This is a misuse because hard-coded keys are bad security practice.

2. It's loading the keystore from a URL, which is insecure and may not be trusted. The URL is to Google's home page, not a keystore.

3. It's generating a random password for the keystore and using it for loading. This could potentially cause a denial of service attack.

Here is the JSON response:
