The misuse in the code is using RC4 algorithm instead of AES for cipher instance creation.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```java
public class B3 {
    public void go(int choice) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");

        if (choice > 1)
            cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B3 bc = new B3();
        int choice=2;
        bc.go(choice);
    }
}
```

Description: In the provided code, the `Cipher.getInstance("RC4")` is used which is a week encryption algorithm. RC4 is no longer considered as secure. It is now recommended to use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) instead for encryption.

Recommendation: Use `Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")` to create the `Cipher` instance. This will use AES with CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode and PKCS5Padding. This is a secure choice for encryption.
