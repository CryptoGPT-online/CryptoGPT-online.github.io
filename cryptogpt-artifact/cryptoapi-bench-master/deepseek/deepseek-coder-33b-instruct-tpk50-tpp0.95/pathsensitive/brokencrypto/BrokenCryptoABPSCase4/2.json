The misuse in this code is the use of RC2 algorithm which is considered weak against brute-force attacks and does not provide adequate security against quantum computers. It also does not provide any authenticity or integrity protection, which might be necessary depending on the application.

Here is the JSON format response:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "RC2 Algorithm used for encryption",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
    "description": "RC2 is considered a weak algorithm. It does not provide adequate security against both classical and quantum computers.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger algorithm like AES which provides strong security against both classical and quantum computers."
}]
