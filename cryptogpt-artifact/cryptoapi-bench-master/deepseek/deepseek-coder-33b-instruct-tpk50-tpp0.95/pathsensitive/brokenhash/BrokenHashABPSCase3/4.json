        "description": "MD4 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. MD4 is considered a weak hash function and there are potential collision attacks. Therefore, the MD4 algorithm is not recommended for any real-world security use.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use stronger cryptographic algorithms. Instead of using MD4, you can use SHA-256 or any other modern hash functions."
