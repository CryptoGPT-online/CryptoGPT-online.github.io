The provided Java code seems to be secure when correctly used. However, it does not implement any cryptographic best practices. Here is a list of potential issues:

1. The choice to use SHA-1 or SHA-256 is variable, which can be a security concern. If an attacker can influence the choice, they might potentially use a weaker hash function.

2. The code only hashes the string "abcdef" without any salting. Salting is a recommended practice to protect against rainbow table attacks. If an attacker can gain knowledge of the hashed string, they might be able to crack it without knowing the original input if it's not salted.

3. The code is susceptible to collision attacks if the input data is controlled by an attacker.

4. The MessageDigest.update() method can be used multiple times to include more data, while the MessageDigest.digest() method is invoked, which can add additional data at the same time. This can potentially introduce a race condition.

In conclusion, the code seems to have some good practices, but the security of the code relies heavily on the input data, and the use of a secure cryptographic library and adhering to good cryptographic practices.
