Here's a JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Cryptographic misuse",
        "vulnerable_code": "md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\"); \nif(choice>1) \n md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\"); \nmd.update(name.getBytes());",
        "description": "This code is vulnerable to Cryptographic misuse because it uses MD5 when the choice is greater than 1. MD5 is a broken cryptographic hash function that is easily forged, meaning that it is trivial to generate a new message that hashes to the same value as an existing message. This can be used to impersonate legitimate users or systems. It's recommended to use SHA-256 or better.",
        "recommendation": "The code should be changed to use SHA-256 or a stronger hash function."
    }
]
