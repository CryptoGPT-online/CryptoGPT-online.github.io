This code sample has the following misuse:

1. Insecure Cryptography API Misuse

Code:
```java
if(choice>1)
    md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```
Description: The code sets the `MessageDigest` to use the SHA-256 algorithm only when `choice` is greater than 1. For most situations, this is insecure because SHA-256 is considered more secure than MD5. If the `choice` is less than or equal to 1, the code defaults to the less secure MD5 algorithm.

Recommendation: Always use secure and trusted algorithms for cryptographic operations. In this case, if `choice` is not 2, the code should default to MD5.

Please note that the output of this code is not easily readable. It's recommended to convert the digest to hexadecimal for easier human readability.

```java
public class B2 {
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String name = "abcdef";
        int choice = 2;
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
        if(choice>1)
            md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        md.update(name.getBytes());
        byte[] digest = md.digest();
        String myHash = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(digest).toLowerCase();
        System.out.println(myHash);
    }
}
```
