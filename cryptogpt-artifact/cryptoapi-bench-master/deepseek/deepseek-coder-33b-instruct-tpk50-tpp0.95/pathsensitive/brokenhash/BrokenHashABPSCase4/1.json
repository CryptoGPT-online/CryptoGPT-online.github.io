This code is not secure. It is vulnerable to CWE-327, which is the weak cryptographic primitive (Weak cryptography primitive used). In this case, the code is using MessageDigest class to calculate a hash, but the choice of cryptographic algorithm is based on a user-controlled variable. This could lead to an insecure usage of crypto API where a hardcoded/predictable algorithm is chosen.

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```java
if(choice>1)
    md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```

This code is vulnerable because the algorithm used for calculating the hash is based on a user-controlled variable. If the choice value is greater than 1, the code will use SHA-256 which is a strong algorithm. However, if the choice value is not greater than 1, the code will use the "MD2" algorithm which is a weak algorithm.

The recommendation is to choose a strong cryptographic algorithm for all cases to avoid this misuse. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public class B4 {
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String name = "abcdef";
        int choice = 2;
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256"); // use SHA-256 for all cases
        md.update(name.getBytes());
        System.out.println(md.digest());
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, the SHA-256 algorithm is used for all cases. This is a better approach because it ensures the code will use a strong cryptographic algorithm.
