        "description": "The code is using the MD2 hashing algorithm, which is considered weak and broken. It might be vulnerable to length extension attacks, and is also no longer recommended for secure hash functions. Additionally, the code checks a user-controlled variable choice before deciding the hashing algorithm to use. This leaves room for an attacker to manipulate the choice and thus select the weak algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the MD2 algorithm with a stronger algorithm. SHA-256 is considered secure for most purposes and still considered good choice. For a better protection, you may also consider using a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) instead of just hashing the data."
