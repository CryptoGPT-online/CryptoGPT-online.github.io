[{
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020; pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The count value is set to 1020, which is less than the recommended 10000 for PBE algorithms, leading to weak encryption strength. This can allow an attacker to decrypt the data with less computational effort.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the count value to at least 10000, and consider increasing it further based on the level of security required."
