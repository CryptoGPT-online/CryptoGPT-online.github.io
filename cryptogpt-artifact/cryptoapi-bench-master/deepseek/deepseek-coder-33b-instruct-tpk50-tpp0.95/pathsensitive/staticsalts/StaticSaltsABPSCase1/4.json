    "description": "This code is always conditionally updating the salt value based on the value of the variable 'choice'. If 'choice' is less than or equal to 1, 'salt' remains the same, which might be fixed or static in the case of '{ (byte) 0xa2 }'. This can lead to weaker security as the salt remains unchanged which can be exploited in brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks. It also makes the hash unpredictable and unique, leading to a weak cryptographic algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a unique salt value for every unique user. It's also a good practice to include the user id or username in the salt. You can use a salt length of at least 64 bits."
