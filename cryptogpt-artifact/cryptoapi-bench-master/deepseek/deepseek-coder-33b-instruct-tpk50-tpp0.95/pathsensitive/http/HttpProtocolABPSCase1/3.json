The code you've posted is not insecure per se, but it can create a misunderstanding about SSL/TLS use, as it may not always use HTTPS for requests to Google. The code should indeed use the URL object in a way that can properly handle the security settings of the URL it's representing.

Here's the JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Network Connection",
        "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
        "description": "This code instantiates a new URL object which uses the url variable as a string. However, it doesn't specify the protocol (like https://). Therefore, by using a plain URL object, the connection might not use HTTPS (which is a secure protocol), which could be a potential misuse.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the protocol when creating the URL object. For example, use new URL(\"https://\" + url) to ensure a secure connection."
    }
]
```
