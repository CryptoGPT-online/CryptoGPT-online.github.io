There are multiple cryptographic misuses in the provided code.

Misuse 1:
```
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding");
```

Description: In this misuse, the developer specifically set the padding to "PKCS1Padding". This is a widely used padding, but "PKCS1Padding" is only secure under certain conditions. It's better to let the JCA (Java Cryptography Architecture) decide the padding.

Recommendation: Remove the "/ECB/PKCS1Padding" part. The JCA will then choose the most secure padding scheme.

Misuse 2:
```
SealedObject encryptedMessage = new SealedObject(myMessage,cipher);
```

Description: In this misuse, the developer used the SealedObject class to encrypt a message. The SealedObject class is designed to allow an object to be encrypted with a symmetric key, then sealed (encrypted) with a public key. However, in this case, it would be more appropriate to use the RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding cipher in order to encrypt the whole message with a single RSA key. The SealedObject class is unnecessary and could lead to misuse if the developer later modifies the code.

Recommendation: Rather than creating a SealedObject, simply use the RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding cipher to encrypt the message.

Misuse 3:
```
String myMessage = new String("Secret Message");
```

Description: This misuse indicates that the developer is encrypting a string message. String data is generally a poor choice for encryption due to its mutability and ability to contain null characters, both of which can lead to padding oracles that can be exploited.

Recommendation: Consider using byte arrays instead of Strings for encryption, especially if the sensitive data can contain null characters.

Misuse 4:
```
int keysize;
if (choice>1)
    keysize = 2048;
else
    keysize = 1024;

kgp.initialize(keysize);
```

Description: The key size depends on the level of security required. A larger key size means a longer processing time and potentially stronger security. However, it also means a larger risk of being broken by a quantum computer.

Recommendation: The key size should be selected based on the security requirements and the current threat landscape, balancing the trade-off between security and processing time. It is recommended to follow the guidance provided by the Cryptographic Storage Standard.
