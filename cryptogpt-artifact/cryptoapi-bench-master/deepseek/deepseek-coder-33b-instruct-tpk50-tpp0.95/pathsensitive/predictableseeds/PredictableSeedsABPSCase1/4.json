        "misuse": "Possible Use of Weak Random Number Generator",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
        "description": "This program uses SecureRandom, which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator, but the seed is set to a predictable value (bytes) at a high level in the code. If the value of the bytes array is predictable or can be controlled by an attacker, they may be able to predict the sequence of random numbers generated by SecureRandom.",
        "recommendation": "SecureRandom should not be used to generate seed for cryptographic purposes. Use other secure ways to generate seed like /dev/urandom or /dev/random in Unix-like systems."
