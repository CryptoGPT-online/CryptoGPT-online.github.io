The code you provided does not contain any explicit crypto API misuse or insecure use of crypto API. However, there are some potential issues that you should consider:

1. Predictable seed for SecureRandom: The `SecureRandom` object is seeded with a fixed byte array `bytes` which is not random. It's always [100, 200]. If an attacker can predict this seed, they could potentially predict the output of the `SecureRandom` object. To fix this, ensure that the seed for `SecureRandom` is as random as possible.

2. Not using a proper crypto algorithm: You're not using any crypto algorithm in this code. If you're trying to generate a secure random number, you should use a proper cryptographically strong random number generator, like `SecureRandom`.

The JSON format response should be:
