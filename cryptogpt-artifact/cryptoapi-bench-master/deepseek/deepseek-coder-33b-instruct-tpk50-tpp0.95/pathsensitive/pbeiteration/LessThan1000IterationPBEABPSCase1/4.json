There is no crypto API misuse in this code. But you should keep in mind that using a high iteration count can significantly increase the amount of time it takes to compute the hash, which in turn could potentially make it vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks. If you're using this code for cryptographic purposes, consider reducing the iteration count or use a different algorithm like Argon2 that supports parameter tuning.

Here is the JSON response:

        "misuse": "Insecure PBE Parameter",
        "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to a high value (1050). This may cause performance issues and potentially make it vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Reduce the iteration count to a more appropriate value. If you're using this code for cryptographic purposes, consider using a different algorithm like Argon2 that supports parameter tuning."
    }
