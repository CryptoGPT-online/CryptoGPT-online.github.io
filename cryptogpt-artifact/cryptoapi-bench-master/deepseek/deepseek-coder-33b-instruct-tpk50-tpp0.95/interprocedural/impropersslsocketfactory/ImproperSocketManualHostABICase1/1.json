This code is using the SSLSocketFactory to create an SSLSocket connection to a remote server, which is a secure and recommended practice. However, the SSL certificate verification is not being done, which is a serious security issue.

A SSLSocketFactory is created using `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` which returns a default factory to create an SSLSocket. However, this factory does not perform hostname verification, which is a critical component of SSL certificate verification. If you use this factory to create a SSLSocket without hostname verification, you may expose your application to man-in-the-middle attacks.

To mitigate this issue, you should use the following steps:

1. Disable the SSL certificate verification: This is not recommended for production, as it can expose your application to security risks.
2. Use a custom SSLSocketFactory with hostname verification.
3. Use truststore that contains the certificate of the server you are connecting to.

Here is an example of how to use a custom SSLSocketFactory with hostname verification:

```java
TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[] {
    new X509TrustManager() {
        public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
            return new X509Certificate[0];
        }
        public void checkClientTrusted(
            java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
        }
        public void checkServerTrusted(
            java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
        }
    }
};

SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
SSLSocketFactory ssf = sc.getSocketFactory();
SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostname, soc);
```

Please note that disabling SSL certificate verification is generally not recommended, as it can expose your application to security risks. Always ensure that your SSL connection is secure.
