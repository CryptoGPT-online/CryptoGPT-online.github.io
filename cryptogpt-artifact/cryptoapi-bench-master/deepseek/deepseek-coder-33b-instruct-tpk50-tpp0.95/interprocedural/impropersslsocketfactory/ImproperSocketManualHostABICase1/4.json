This code is using SSLSocketFactory to create an SSL/TLS connection, but there are no specific misuses that need to be reported. It's generally okay to use SSLSocketFactory in this way. However, this code does not verify the hostname or the server's certificate. 

Verifying the server's hostname helps ensure that you're connecting to the right server. If you do not verify the server's hostname, you risk a man-in-the-middle attack.

Verifying the server's certificate helps ensure that you're communicating with the intended server and not an imposter. If you do not verify the server's certificate, you risk a man-in-the-middle attack or a downgrade attack.

To fix this, you can use the SSLSocket.setUseClientMode(true) method to set the client mode to be on and then use SSLSocket.startHandshake() method. This will perform necessary handshaking with the server. 

Here is the updated code:

```java
private static void go(String hostname, int soc) throws IOException {
    SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
    SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostname,soc);
    socket.setUseClientMode(true);
    socket.startHandshake();
}
```

However, please note that this still won't solve your problem if the server's certificate is not verified. In that case, you need to manually verify the server's certificate.

This code does not contain any misuses that are related to any specific CWE categories you mentioned.
