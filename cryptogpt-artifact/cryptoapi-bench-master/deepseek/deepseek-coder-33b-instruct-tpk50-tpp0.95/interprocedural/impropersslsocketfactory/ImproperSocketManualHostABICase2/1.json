The code provided does not contain any misuses related to the CWE vulnerabilities you're interested in. However, there are a few potential security considerations that you may want to consider.

1. The hostname and port are hardcoded into the program. This could potentially make it easier for an attacker to target your program. If possible, consider making these values configurable, either through command-line arguments or environment variables.

2. The program uses SSL, which is generally a good thing. However, it's worth noting that an attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack if the program is not configured properly to verify the server's certificate. SSL should be used properly to avoid this, possibly by using a certificate from a trusted CA and implementing proper certificate validation.

3. There's a potential misuse in the 'go' method. In the line where we create the SSL socket, we are converting the 'hostName' char array to String before passing it to the 'createSocket' method, which can cause a potential security issue if 'hostName' array contains null characters. This can lead to an exception being thrown and the program being terminated. It would be safer to use the 'createSocket' method which accepts a String.

Here is the refactored version of 'go' method:

```java
private static void go(int soc) throws IOException {
    SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
    SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(new String(hostName), soc);
}
```

Keep in mind, these are general security considerations and might not be applicable in all cases. The exact security considerations would depend on your specific use case and requirements.
