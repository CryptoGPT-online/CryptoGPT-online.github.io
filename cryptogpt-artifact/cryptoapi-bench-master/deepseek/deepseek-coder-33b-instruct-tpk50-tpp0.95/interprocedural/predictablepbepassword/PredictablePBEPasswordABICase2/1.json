The provided code is not directly using the PBEKeySpec. However, there are a few potential misuses related to Crypto API misuse, PBEKeySpec specifically. 

Misuse 1: Unnecessary use of static variables and methods
Description: The code uses a lot of static variables and methods. Unnecessary use of static variables and methods can make the code difficult to maintain and test. 

Misuse 2: Direct use of char[] type for encryption key
Description: The use of char[] type for encryption key can leak sensitive information during a memory dump. 

Misuse 3: Unsafe use of PBEKeySpec
Description: In the provided code, there is a misuse of PBEKeySpec. An instance of PBEKeySpec is created in the "go()" method using an instance variable "encryptKey". If "encryptKey" is not initialized properly before "go()" method is called, it can lead to NullPointerException. 

Suggested fix: 
Replace the static variables "ENCRYPT_KEY" and "encryptKey" with instance variables, and initialize these variables properly before calling the "go()" method. Also, instead of using the raw char[] type, the SecretKeyFactory with PBEKeySpec can be used to generate a secure SecretKey. 

Here is the fixed code:
```java
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.security.spec.KeySpec;

public class P2 {
    private byte [] salt = new byte[16];
    private PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec;
    public static String KEY = "sagar";
    public static char [] DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = KEY.toCharArray();
    private char[] ENCRYPT_KEY;
    private char[] encryptKey;

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        P2 pksp = new P2();
        pksp.go2();
        pksp.go3();
        pksp.go();
    }

    private void go2(){
        this.ENCRYPT_KEY = DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY;
    }
    private void go3(){
        this.encryptKey = ENCRYPT_KEY;
    }

    private void go() {
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.nextBytes(salt);
        pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey, salt, 10000, 16);
    }
}
```
Please note that the SecureRandom implementation and the iteration count for PBEKeySpec are also not suitable for production code. These should be increased for stronger security.
