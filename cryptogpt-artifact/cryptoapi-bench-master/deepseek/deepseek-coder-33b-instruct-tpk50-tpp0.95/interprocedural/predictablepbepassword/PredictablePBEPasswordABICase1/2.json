This code contains a misuse of the PBEKeySpec API, which is a crypto API misuse. 

Misuse: Weak PBE Iteration Count.

Vulnerable Code:

```java
int iterationCount = 11010;
pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);
```

Description: The iteration count is set to 11010, which is relatively low. It's recommended that at least 10000 iterations are used for PBKDF2. 

Recommendation: Increase the iteration count to a higher number to increase the security of the encryption process. For example:

```java
int iterationCount = 50000;
pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);
```

Please note that the actual value for iteration count can vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your application. However, the recommended minimum value is 10000.
