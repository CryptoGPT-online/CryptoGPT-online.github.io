There is no crypto API misuse in the provided code. However, it's important to note that you are using a very low iteration count for PBE (Password-Based Encryption). This is not a security concern in itself, but could potentially limit the security of your encryption if it is vulnerable to brute force attacks, as it might take a considerable amount of time or resources to compute enough rounds to make the encryption secure.

For further security, you should use at least a 1000 iterations for PBE, or ideally a larger number. It's recommended to use a higher iteration count for PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2), which is often used with PBE, due to the computational overhead it adds.

Here is your code with a higher iteration count:

```java
public class S3 {
    public static void main(String [] args){
        byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};
        int count = 10000; // Higher iteration count
        method1(salt,count);
    }
    public static void method1(byte[] s, int c){
        int count2 = c;
        method2(s,count2);
    }

    public static void method2(byte[] salt, int count){
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
    }
}
```
