  "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
  "description": "The algorithm used in this code snippet (PBEParameterSpec) requires a salt to make the hash more secure. Using a fixed salt (such as in this example) without generating a new salt for each hash makes it easier to crack the hashes when the same salt is used for multiple hashes. This is a bad practice in cryptography.",
  "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated salt for each hash to ensure the security of your hash functions. In the case of PBEParameterSpec, you can generate a random salt using a SecureRandom instance."
