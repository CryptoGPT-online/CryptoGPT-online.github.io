The code you provided seems fine except for the following security misuse:

- `new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(salt.toString())}`: This line attempts to convert the `char[]` array `salt` to a `byte[]` array. However, this will fail for arrays with more than one element. The `toString()` method will return a `String` representation of the `salt` array, which is not suitable for the `Byte.parseByte()` method. This can result in `NumberFormatException` at runtime if the `salt` array contains more than one element, or unexpected results if it contains only one element.

Recommendation:

To resolve this issue, you should convert each `char` in the `salt` array to `byte`, which can be done by iterating over the `salt` array and converting each `char` to `byte`.

Here's a corrected version of the `key2()` method:

```java
public void key2(int count){
    PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
    byte[] byteArray = new byte[salt.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < salt.length; i++) {
        byteArray[i] = (byte) salt[i];
    }
    pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(byteArray, count);
}
```

This corrected version converts each `char` in the `salt` array to `byte` correctly, regardless of the array's length.
