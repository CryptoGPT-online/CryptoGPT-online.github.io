        "vulnerable_code": "new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The count parameter in PBEParameterSpec is often used to specify the number of iterations for password-based encryption (PBE) algorithms. Using an inadequate count can reduce the security of the encryption, as an attacker with sufficient resources can crack the encryption with fewer iterations.",
        "recommendation": "Depending on the cryptographic needs, the count should typically be set to a minimum of 1,000. For high security, consider even higher values. It is also advisable to increase the length of the salt used in conjunction with the PBEParameterSpec to improve the security of the encryption."
