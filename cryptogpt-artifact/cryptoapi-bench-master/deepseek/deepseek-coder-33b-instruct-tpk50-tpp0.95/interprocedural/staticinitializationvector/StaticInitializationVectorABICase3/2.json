There are several cryptography-related misuses in the code:

1. AES key is generated for each encryption operation. This makes the cipher vulnerable to chosen plaintext attack. Instead, the same key should be used for each encryption operation.

2. The same initialization vector (IV) is used for each encryption operation. This is also insecure. An IV should be randomly generated for each encryption operation and securely stored.

Here is the JSON response:
