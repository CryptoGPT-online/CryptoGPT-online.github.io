There are several misuses in the provided Java code. 

1. Reusing IVs in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, a mode of operation for block ciphers, is a severe and frequent misuse, known as "Initialization Vector (IV) Reuse". 
2. Key generation without entropy (randomness). The program generates a random key using KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES"), without any seeding of the random number generator. This is a major vulnerability as it could result in a predictable IV that can be leveraged by an attacker.

These are critical misuses in cryptography and can be used to create a variety of attacks, such as "Initialization Vector Reuse" and "Key Reuse".

Here is the JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "IV Reuse",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec);",
        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is being reused which could lead to potential security issues. In CBC mode, it's crucial to generate a new IV every time encryption is performed to ensure the encrypted message isn't vulnerable to attack.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a new IV every time encryption is performed. This can be done by using a secure random number generator to create the IV."
    },

        "misuse": "Key Generation without Entropy",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
        "description": "The program generates a random key using KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\") without any seeding of the random number generator. This can be exploited by an attacker who can predict or know the seed used to generate the key.",
        "recommendation": "Seed the random number generator used to generate the key, to ensure the key is truly random and difficult to predict."
