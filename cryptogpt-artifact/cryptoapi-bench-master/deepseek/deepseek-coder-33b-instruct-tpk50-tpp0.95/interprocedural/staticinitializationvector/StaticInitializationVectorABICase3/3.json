There are two major misuses in the provided code:

1. Key Reuse: The same key is being used for encryption every time the method2 is called. This is a security risk as it increases the risk that the encryption is susceptible to attacks.

2. Initialization Vector (IV) Reuse: The same IV is being used every time the method2 is called. Reusing an IV can potentially leak information about the plaintext, which can be harmful in some scenarios.

Here are the vulnerabilities:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Key Reuse",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();\n",
        "description": "Using the same key for encrypting different data can expose patterns in the data. This can lead to data leakage and other serious security issues.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a new key for each encryption operation."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Initialization Vector (IV) Reuse",
        "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec);\n",
        "description": "The same Initialization Vector (IV) is being used for multiple encryptions, which may leak information about the plaintext in some cases.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a new IV for each encryption operation."
    }
]
