The provided code is not vulnerable to the Crypto misuse security audits. 

For crypto related misuses, it is important to note that AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm. It uses the same key for encryption and decryption. The key should be generated and stored securely. Furthermore, it's important to generate a new Initialization Vector (IV) every time for more secure encryption.

However, the provided code doesn't follow these best practices. There's no specific IV generation or it's not used correctly in the `Cipher` initialisation. It directly converts a character to byte, which might lead to incorrect encryption result.

Below is the JSON response that shows the misuse:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_INITIALIZATION = \"abcde\";",
        "description": "The key 'abcde' used in the code is hard-coded and it should be stored securely, possibly in a configuration file or environment variable.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to store sensitive data like keys securely and fetch them from a secure storage. Use environment variables or a configuration file to store these values."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Incorrect IV usage",
        "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(String.valueOf(initialization))});",
        "description": "The IV (Initialization Vector) is incorrectly used in this case. It should be randomly generated for each encryption. The hard-coded byte conversion also seems inappropriate here.",
        "recommendation": "In order to generate a secure IV, it should be randomly generated with a secure random number generator. The IV should never be reused for the same key. The IV must be securely shared between the encrypting and decrypting parties."
    }
]
