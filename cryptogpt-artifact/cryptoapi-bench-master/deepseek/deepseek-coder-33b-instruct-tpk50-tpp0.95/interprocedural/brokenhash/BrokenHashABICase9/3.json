[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);","description": "The code uses SHA-1 for cryptography. SHA-1 is not considered secure because a hash collision attack can be carried out in practically no time. The algorithm can also be broken if a larger hash size is used. A more secure algorithm to use is SHA-256 or SHA-3.","recommendation": "Replace 'SHA1' with 'SHA-256' or 'SHA-3' in the 'crypto' parameter when calling method2 from main."}]
