CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

This problem involves using a weak crypto algorithm like MD5, which should not be used for storing passwords due to its insecurity.

Misuse Code:
```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);
```

Description: The cryptographic hash function MD5 was designed for software testing and it's now considered insecure. It can be exploited to generate MD5 hash collisions.

Recommendation: Instead of MD5, use SHA-256, which is a more secure cryptographic hash function. Also, note that MD5 is no longer considered secure for other uses.

Response: [{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);", "description": "The use of the MD5 hashing algorithm is not secure because it has been proven to have collision problems. It should not be used for storing passwords due to its insecurity.", "recommendation": "Use SHA-256 or any other strong cryptographic hash function for secure hashing."}]
