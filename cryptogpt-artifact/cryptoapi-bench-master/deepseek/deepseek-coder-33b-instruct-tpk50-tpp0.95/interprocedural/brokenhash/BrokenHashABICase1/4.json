The code is not vulnerable to any of the CWE-* issues that you mentioned. It's using SHA1 algorithm which is a secure hash algorithm for SHA-1 that generates an almost-unique, fixed size 160-bit hash string. 

```

    "misuse": "None",
    "vulnerable_code": "None",
    "description": "The given code is using SHA1 which is a secure hashing algorithm for SHA-1 that generates an almost-unique, fixed size 160-bit hash string.",
    "recommendation": "If you are not using the SHA-1, you should update your crypto API to a more secure one such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
