        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The code uses a default cryptographic algorithm (MD5) that is considered insecure. Using a cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered secure can expose applications to a wide range of vulnerabilities, including attacks that could allow a potential attacker to decrypt and manipulate data or gain unauthorized access.",
        "recommendation": "It's recommended to use more secure hash functions such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. To implement it, replace 'MD5' with 'SHA-256' or 'SHA-3'. However, you need to make sure the hashing algorithm chosen suits your specific use case."
