    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in this code is weak because it is directly based on a String which could be modified. MD4 and MD5 are known to have collision problems and are not considered secure for many applications. SHA-1 is also known to have collision problems and is not recommended for similar use-cases due to the increased vulnerability to brute force attacks and length extension attacks. It is recommended to use SHA-256 or above.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the 'crypto' string with a stronger cryptographic algorithm name directly in the getInstance method or create a setter method for 'crypto' that only allows the use of secure cryptographic algorithms."
