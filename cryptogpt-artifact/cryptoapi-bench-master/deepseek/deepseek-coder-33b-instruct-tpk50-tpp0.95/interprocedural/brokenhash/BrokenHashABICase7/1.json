There are a few security-related issues with your code. 

1. Use of MD4 which is considered insecure and outdated. The code uses MD4 which is a hashing algorithm. MD4 is considered weak by many experts and has been completely broken.

Here is the code with JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Use of Weak Cryptographic Algorithms",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "MD4 is a weak cryptographic hash function, which means it is no longer considered safe for most applications. This algorithm is no longer recommended for most uses because serious flaws have been discovered in the design of the algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger hashing algorithm like SHA-256, SHA-3."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Hardcoding Sensitive Information",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"MD4\";",
        "description": "This code has hardcoded sensitive information, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as accidental disclosure, unauthorized modification, etc. If the code is distributed to a third party or even open source, this could be a security risk.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a configuration file or environment variable to store and manage sensitive information."
    }
]
```
