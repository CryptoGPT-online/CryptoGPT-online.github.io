    "description": "The crypto variable is assigned a reference to CRYPTO array. When CRYPTO array is updated, the changes will also reflect in crypto variable as they both are pointing to the same array in the memory. It can lead to a problem of exposing sensitive data, as crypto variable can be used later in the code without proper checks. This might pose a risk of accidental disclosure of cryptographic keys.",
    "recommendation": "Always use String type to store sensitive data like cryptographic keys. Alternatively, copy the array if you need to use the reference elsewhere. Consider using methods that return a new copy of the array to avoid modifying the original array."
