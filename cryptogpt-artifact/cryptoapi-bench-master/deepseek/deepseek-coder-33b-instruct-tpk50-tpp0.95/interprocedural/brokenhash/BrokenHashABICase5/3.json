Misuse: Use of a broken or insecure cryptographic algorithm
Misuse Code Snippets: `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));`
Description: The cryptographic algorithm being used (`SHA1`) is considered broken and insecure. It is no longer secure because collision attacks on SHA-1 are now a practical possibility, and itâ€™s no longer approved for most cryptographic uses.
Recommendation: You should use a more secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. Here's how you can fix the code:

```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```

Alternatively, if you have a specific need for the SHA-1 algorithm, you should do so carefully and understand the risks.
