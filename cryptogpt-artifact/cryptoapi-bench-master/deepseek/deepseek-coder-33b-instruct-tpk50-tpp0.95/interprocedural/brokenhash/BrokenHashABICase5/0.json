The provided Java code is highly insecure. The variable 'crypto' is initialized in the method 'go3' using the content of the variable 'CRYPTO' but the content of 'CRYPTO' is set only in the 'go2' method which is never invoked in the main method. That means, the 'crypto' variable will remain null in the 'go' method and will cause an exception when trying to use the value of the 'crypto' variable to get the instance of the MessageDigest.

Here's the misuse in JSON format:
```json
[{
    "misuse": "Incorrect Initialization",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = CRYPTO;",
    "description": "The variable 'crypto' is initialized with the content of 'CRYPTO' before it is being initialized in the 'go2' method.",
    "recommendation": "Initialize the 'crypto' variable within 'go2' method to ensure its initialization."
}]
```
