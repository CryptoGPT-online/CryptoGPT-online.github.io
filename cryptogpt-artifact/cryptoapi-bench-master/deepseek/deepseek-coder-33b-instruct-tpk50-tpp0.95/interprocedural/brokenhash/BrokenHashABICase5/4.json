There is no misuse in the given code. It seems to be correct. 

However, if there were any crypto-related issues, it would most likely be related to the following:

1. "CRYPTO" and "crypto" are public. This can be a security issue if this code was shared as a library.
2. MD5 and SHA-1 are considered weak hash functions and should not be used in applications where security is a concern. They can easily be broken by attackers.
3. It should be noted that this code relies on an external input for "crypto". If the user-provided input is not one of the expected values, it could cause an issue.

In general, to avoid these issues, it's recommended to:

1. Limit the visibility of variables and methods to the smallest scope possible.
2. Use stronger hash functions like SHA-256 or SHA-3 for secure operations.
3. If you allow user input for cryptographic operations, validate and sanitize the input to avoid injection attacks.
4. Never store sensitive data such as passwords or cryptographic keys in plain text or as strings. If you must store such data, consider using secure methods such as encryption or hashing.
