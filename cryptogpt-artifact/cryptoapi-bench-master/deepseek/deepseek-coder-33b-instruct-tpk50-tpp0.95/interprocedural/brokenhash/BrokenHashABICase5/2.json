  "description": "Cryptographic keys are stored in plain text or as byte arrays, which can be easily accessed and misused. This code stores the cryptographic key in two ways: as a static string, and as a static char array.",
  "recommendation": "Instead of storing cryptographic keys directly in the code, they should be stored in a secure storage location such as a key store or a hardware security module (HSM). The encryption key should never be hard-coded or stored in plain text."
