Misuse type: Broken Crypto Algorithm

vulnerable_code: String crypto = "MD4";

description: MD4 is considered broken and it should not be used for any purpose where security is required. It is vulnerable to attacks like length extension and other vulnerabilities.

recommendation: Use a crypto hash algorithm that is not considered broken, such as SHA-256. This hash function provides a secure way to generate a hash. Here is how you can implement it:

String crypto = "SHA-256";

{
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"MD4\";",
    "description": "MD4 is considered broken and it should not be used for any purpose where security is required. It is vulnerable to attacks like length extension and other vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a crypto hash algorithm that is not considered broken, such as SHA-256. This hash function provides a secure way to generate a hash."
}
