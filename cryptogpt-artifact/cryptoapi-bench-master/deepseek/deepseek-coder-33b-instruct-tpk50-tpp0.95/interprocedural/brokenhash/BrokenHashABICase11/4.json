Misuse:

Using MD4 is a weak hash function

Vulnerable Code:
```java
String crypto = "MD4";
```
```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);
```

Description:
MD4 and MD5 are both weak cryptographic hash functions. They were designed in the 1990s and have many known collision attacks against them. They are no longer considered secure for most purposes. They should not be used for any cryptographic purpose where collision resistance is important, such as digital signatures.

Recommendation:
The recommended practice is to use at least SHA-256. In Java, this can be done as follows:

```java
String crypto = "SHA-256";
```

```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);
```
