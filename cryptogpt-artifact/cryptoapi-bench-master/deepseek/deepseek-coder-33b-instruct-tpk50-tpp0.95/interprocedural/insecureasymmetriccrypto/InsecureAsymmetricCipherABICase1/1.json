The given Java code uses RSA for encryption and decryption, which is a common choice for asymmetric encryption. However, there are several security concerns and misuses detected:

1. The key size is set based on a variable "keySize". The key size is usually a constant known at compile time, and it is not advisable to change it at runtime, as it may introduce security weaknesses. This could be a vulnerability to the side-channel attacks or timing attacks. The RSA key size should be at least 2048 bits for current security standards.

2. The SealedObject is used, which is a way of combining encrypted data with an encrypted key. However, in this case, the SealedObject is used with only a public key, which can lead to a possible security issue in the future if you decide to use a different key pair for encryption or decryption.

3. Exception handling is too broad. The code catches all types of exceptions, but it's usually better to be more specific about which exceptions you want to handle. This can make your code easier to debug and maintain, because you know exactly what exceptions can be thrown.

4. The key pair generation process does not handle the random number generator properly. This could potentially lead to a security issue if the random number generator is not properly seeded with a strong random number.

Here is the JSON response containing the above findings:
