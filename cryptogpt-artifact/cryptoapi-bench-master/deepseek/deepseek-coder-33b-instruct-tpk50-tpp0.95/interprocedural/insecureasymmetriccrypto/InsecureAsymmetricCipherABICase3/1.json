The provided code has a number of cryptographic misuses:

1. The key size is set by the user input. The cryptographic keys should not be smaller than the default size and not larger than the maximum recommended size. However, the user can adjust the key size and thus it is not always secure. The crypto library should allow a way to set a default key size and use it, instead of allowing any size to be used.

2. The use of 'RSA' algorithm is not considered secure for encrypting data and should not be used for new projects or for encrypting sensitive information. For such cases, it is better to use 'AES' or 'RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding' algorithm.

3. Cipher.getInstance("RSA") and KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA") both initialize an RSA cipher and generator respectively. Although this is a valid use of crypto API, it doesn't provide any additional security as opposed to initializing them with AES or RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding.

4. Using the same KeyPair for both encryption and decryption. Generating a new keypair for each encryption operation is recommended because it ensures that even if the private key gets leaked or guessed, the attacker will not be able to decrypt any message encrypted with the private key.
