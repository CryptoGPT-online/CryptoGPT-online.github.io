Misuses Detected:

1. Using a weak key size: The key size specified in this code is determined by the variable key which is passed as an argument to method2(). The value of key can be customized by the user in the main() function. The key size specified here is 1024, which is considered a weak key size. 

Misuse Code Snippet:

```java
public static void method2(int k) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, IOException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException, ClassNotFoundException {
    int keySize = k;
    method1(keySize);
}
```

```java
public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, IOException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException, ClassNotFoundException {
    int key = 1024;
    method2(key);
}
```

Description: 

Weak key sizes can leave the encryption algorithm vulnerable to attacks. In the case of RSA, a key size of at least 2048 bits is recommended to provide similar security level as 3072 bits.

Recommendation:

Consider using a stronger key size, such as 2048 bits or more. Ensure the key size is selected based on the requirements of the application and not based on general advice like "the larger the better". Key size selection depends on factors such as the system's performance, the sensitivity of the data, and the computational power of potential attackers.
