There are several misuses in this code:

1. Broken Crypto Algorithm: You are using the "RSA" cipher, which is fine for key generation but not for encryption and decryption of data. You should use the RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding or RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding for symmetric key algorithms.

2. Hard-Coded Crypto Key Size: The key size is hard-coded, which can be a security risk. It's better to generate the key with a random size.

3. No Key Expiration: The keys generated in this code will not have an expiration date.

4. Key Size Exposure: The key size is exposed via a public static field.
