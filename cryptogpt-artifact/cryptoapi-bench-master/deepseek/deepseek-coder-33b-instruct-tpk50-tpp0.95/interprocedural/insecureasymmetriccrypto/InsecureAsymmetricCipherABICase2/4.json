This code has multiple cryptographic misuses as listed below:

1. It uses a statically set key size for generating the key pair. This is a problem as the size of the key can be set dynamically according to the level of security required. 

2. It does not initialize a secure random instance for the key pair generation which may lead to predictable keys.

3. It does not use the key pair generator instance "kgp" in generating the key pair. This is unnecessary and will lead to a different key being generated each time.

4. The encryption and decryption is done using the same KeyPair instance which is incorrect, it should be using separate instances for encryption and decryption.

5. The SealedObject class is used for encryption which is not the best practice and can lead to other potential misuses such as insecure deserialization.

Remember to always use secure and up-to-date libraries and to follow best practices for cryptography in Java.
