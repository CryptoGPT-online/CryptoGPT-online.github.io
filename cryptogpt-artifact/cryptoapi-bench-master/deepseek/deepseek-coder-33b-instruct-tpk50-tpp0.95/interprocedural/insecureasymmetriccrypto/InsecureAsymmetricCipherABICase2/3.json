This code is using RSA cipher with SealedObject for encryption and decryption of messages. However, it has the following security misuses:

1. Initializing KeyPairGenerator with a variable key size:
   The KeyPairGenerator's initialize method takes a key size as input, but here it's initialized with a variable (keysize). The keysize's value is set from a static variable which is not modified within this class. It could lead to inconsistent or insecure key sizes, especially if the value of keysize is controlled externally. The recommended way is to use a constant or fixed key size.

```java
KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
kgp.initialize(KEY_SIZE); // use a constant or fixed key size
KeyPair kp = kgp.generateKeyPair();
```

2. Storing encrypted data in a SealedObject before it is encrypted:
   A SealedObject is used to encapsulate an object and a Cipher for encryption. However, before the encryption takes place, the SealedObject is constructed. This could result in unencrypted data being stored in the SealedObject, and hence, it could be a potential source of data leakage or plaintext data available to an attacker.

```java
SealedObject encryptedMessage = new SealedObject(myMessage,cipher);
```

In summary, the key size should be fixed or constant to avoid insecure behavior and data should be encrypted before being stored in a SealedObject.
