There seems to be no misuse of any cryptographic API (as per the list given) in the code provided. The code simply creates a URL object with the string representation of the URL.

However, it would be worth noting that the URL being used in this example is a URL to "www.google.com", which is a public website and is not related to cryptographic operations.

If your codebase was manipulating data related to cryptographic operations, you should consult the cryptographic API guidelines for potential misuses.
