The code provided appears to be correct, and there are no immediate crypto API misuses. The code is taking a URL string, creating a new URL object, and then printing it. 

However, this code has a potential security issue. Specifically, the `URL(String spec)` constructor can throw a `MalformedURLException` if the provided string is not a valid URL. This exception should be caught and handled, rather than simply re-throwing it.

Here's an example of how the code could be updated to handle the exception:

```java
public class H1 {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        String url = "http://www.google.com";
        try {
            go(url);
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static void go(String url) throws MalformedURLException {
        System.out.println(new URL(url));
    }
}
```

In the updated code, `MalformedURLException` is caught in the `main` method and not re-thrown. Instead, the stack trace of the exception is printed for debugging purposes.
