        "description": "The code creates a new URL object using a string. This is not secure because if the string is not a valid URL, it will not be recognized as an error and an exception will not be thrown. Instead, the constructor will silently create an invalid URL that might not work as expected.",
        "recommendation": "In the go() method, before creating the new URL, you should validate the URL first. You can use libraries such as Apache Commons Validator or simply use a regular expression to check if the URL is valid."
