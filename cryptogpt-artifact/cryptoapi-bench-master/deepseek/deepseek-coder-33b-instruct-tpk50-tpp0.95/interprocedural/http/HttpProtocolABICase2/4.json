        "description": "The `url` variable is an array of characters that is created from a string with the `toCharArray()` method. When this `url` variable is used as a string for URL creation using `new URL()`, it might not properly handle special elements. For example, if `url` contains any characters that need to be encoded (such as `%`, `#`, etc.) in a URL, they may not be handled properly. As a result, a potential URL misuse scenario could lead to open redirect, XXE, or other types of vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Always ensure proper encoding and escaping of special characters when constructing URLs. In Java, you can use the `URLEncoder.encode()` method for this purpose."
