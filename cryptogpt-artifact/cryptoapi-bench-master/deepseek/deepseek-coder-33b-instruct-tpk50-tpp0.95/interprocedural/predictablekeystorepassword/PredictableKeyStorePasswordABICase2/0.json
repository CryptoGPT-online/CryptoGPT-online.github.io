The code is misusing the `KeyStore.load()` method, which is typically used to load a KeyStore with a private key and certificate, and also uses a secret key to decrypt it. 

Misuses:

1. Hard-coded Encryption Key: The code uses a hard-coded encryption key "changeit" (`DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY`). Using hard-coded keys can be a security risk as it may expose the key to attackers.

2. Insecure Keys: The keys used are global variables (`ENCRYPT_KEY` and `encryptKey`) and are not private and accessible across the class.

3. URL-based Truststore: The code is attempting to load a KeyStore from a URL, which is an unsecure way to load a truststore since it can be manipulated or redirected.

Here is the JSON response:
