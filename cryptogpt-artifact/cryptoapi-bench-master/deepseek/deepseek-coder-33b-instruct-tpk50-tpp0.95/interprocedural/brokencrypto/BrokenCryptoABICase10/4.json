The provided code is not directly vulnerable to the problems you mentioned, but it does have the following issues:

1. `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` is a public static final string, which means it can be modified directly. This may not be an issue in many applications, but it could be a problem in some secure applications.

2. `CRYPTO` and `crypto` are never initialized. The `go2` and `go3` methods attempt to initialize them, but if they're called before the methods that use them (such as `go`), they'll still be null when `go` is called.

3. `go2` and `go3` are static methods that manipulate static fields. This may cause confusion in code that's reading your class.

4. `go` method initializes a KeyGenerator and a Cipher using the string value of `crypto`. If `crypto` is not initialized, this could throw a NullPointerException.

5. `go` method also initializes a Cipher with the same string value of `crypto`, which is passed to `KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))`. If crypto is not initialized, this could throw a NullPointerException.

6. It is not clear whether this code is part of a larger application. If it is, it's important to consider the overall security implications. For example, if `crypto` is manipulated in a way that allows an attacker to control it, they could potentially manipulate the `Cipher` used by your code.

Here is the code snippet to fix these issues. You can initialize the `CRYPTO` and `crypto` fields in the constructor of your class:

```java
public class B0 {
    public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = "IDEA";
    private static char[] CRYPTO;
    private static char[] crypto;
    
    public B0() {
        CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
        crypto = CRYPTO;
    }
    
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }
    
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B0 bc = new B0();
        bc.go();
    }
}
```
This code initializes `crypto` and `CRYPTO` fields in the constructor of the `B0` class, so `go` method will not throw `NullPointerException` when the fields are initialized.
