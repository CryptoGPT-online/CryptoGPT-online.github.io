Yes, there is a misuse in your code which involves the use of Cryptographic Algorithms. 

In this code, the cryptographic algorithm is determined by a char array, which is set to a static variable CRYPTO in the method `go2` and then later passed to the `go3` method. The `go3` method sets this static char array to an instance variable `crypto`. Then, in the `go` method, this instance variable `crypto` is used to get an instance of KeyGenerator and Cipher.

The use of static instance variables can lead to unexpected behaviour, especially in multithreaded applications. Because static variables are shared across all instances of a class, changing them in one instance can affect other instances.

In your code, `go2` method is setting `CRYPTO` to `DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray()` which is a final and static variable. So, the value of `CRYPTO` is fixed. On the other hand, `go3` method is setting `crypto` to `CRYPTO` which is an instance variable, so its value can be changed.

The recommendation is to remove the static keyword from `crypto` variable. Static instance variables should only be used in rare circumstances, and in this case, they are causing unexpected behaviour in your program.
