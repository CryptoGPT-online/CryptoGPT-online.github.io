This code has a misuse in the `go` method. RC2 is an outdated crypto algorithm and is now considered insecure. It should not be used in new designs as it has been found to have multiple cryptographic flaws.

        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "This code creates a SecretKey using the outdated cryptographic algorithm RC2.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the outdated cryptographic algorithms (like RC2) with newer ones which are more secure. An example of a secure algorithm is AES."
