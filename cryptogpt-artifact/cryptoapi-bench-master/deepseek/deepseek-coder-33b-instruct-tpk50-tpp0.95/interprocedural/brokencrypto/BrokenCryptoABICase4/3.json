Misuse Type: "Broken Crypto Algorithm"
Misuse Code Snippets:
```
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
```
Description: The code uses the obsolete RC2 encryption algorithm which is considered insecure. RC2 is no longer recommended for secure encryption.

Recommendation: Switch to more secure encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, etc.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
public class B4 {
    public void go(String crypto) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B4 bc = new B4();
        String crypto = "RC2";
        bc.go(crypto);
    }
}
```

Please note that this is just a demonstration, actual key generation and cipher creation can vary based on your requirements.
