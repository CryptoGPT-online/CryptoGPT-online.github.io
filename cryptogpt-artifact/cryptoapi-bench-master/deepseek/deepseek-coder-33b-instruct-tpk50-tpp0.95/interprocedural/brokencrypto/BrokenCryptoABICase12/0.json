Misuse: "Weak Cryptographic Principle"

Vulnerable Code:

```java
public static void method2(String c) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        String cryptoAlgo = c;
        method1(cryptoAlgo);
    }
    public static void method1(String crypto) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {

        String crypto = "Blowfish";
        method2(crypto);
    }
```

Description: 
The Cipher object is instantiated using the "crypto" parameter, which in this case is set to "Blowfish". Blowfish is a known weak cryptographic algorithm and is no longer considered secure for new applications. Its strength has been broken and its encryption can be easily broken.

Recommendation:
Instead of "Blowfish" use more secure algorithms like "AES" for symmetric encryption. 

Please note that this is a misuse, but a weak one since there are other CWE categories that can be applied to this code as well. This misuse is a direct violation of CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
