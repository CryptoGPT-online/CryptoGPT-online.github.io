    "description": "The RC2 algorithm is not recommended anymore because it is insecure and has a number of known vulnerabilities. It's been deprecated since 2015 and its use has been heavily phased out in Java 8. RC2 encryption is weak and it will be vulnerable if not updated.",
    "recommendation": "You should not use the RC2 algorithm anymore. Instead, you should use a modern algorithm like AES. For Java, consider using `AES` instead."
