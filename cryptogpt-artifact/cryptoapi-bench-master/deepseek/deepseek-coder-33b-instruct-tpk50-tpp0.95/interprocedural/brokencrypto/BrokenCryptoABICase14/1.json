Misuse of Cryptography:
The code is using the RC2 cryptographic algorithm, which is not recommended for modern cryptographic use. RC2 has been officially deprecated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2002 due to its weak security properties.

Vulnerable Code:
method2("RC2");

Description:
This code uses the RC2 cryptographic algorithm. RC2 is not considered secure, especially not for longer term storage or when it comes to high security scenarios. 

Recommendation:
Avoid using RC2 and use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman) instead.
