    "description": "The code uses the crypto algorithm RC2, which is considered to be weak. It is no longer secure and can be exploited by attackers. Also, RC2 does not support the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, which is a more secure mode of operation.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using RC2, use stronger and more modern algorithms like AES. Also, ensure to use a secure mode of operation like CBC for encryption. Consider using a library like Bouncy Castle for crypto operations."
