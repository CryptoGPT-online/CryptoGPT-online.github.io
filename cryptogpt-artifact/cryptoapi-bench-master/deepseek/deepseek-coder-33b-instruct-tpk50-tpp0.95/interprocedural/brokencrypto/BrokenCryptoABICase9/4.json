        "misuse": "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto)",
        "description": "The crypto parameter is directly used to choose the cipher algorithm which is considered insecure and vulnerable. In the provided code, it uses 'IDEA'.",
        "recommendation": "Choose a secure and modern encryption algorithm. For instance, 'AES' is generally considered secure, or you could choose from the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) family of algorithms, like 'AES-128', 'AES-192', 'AES-256' for different levels of security."
