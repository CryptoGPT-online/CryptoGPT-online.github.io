This code is vulnerable to the misuse of cryptographic algorithm. RC4 is a weak and broken algorithm. 

In cryptographic applications, it is recommended to avoid using RC4 and consider using a more secure algorithm such as AES. The weaknesses in RC4 and other broken cryptographic algorithms mean that they are easier to attack and less resistant to quantum computing.
