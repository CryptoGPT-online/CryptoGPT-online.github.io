        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm DES is not recommended for most new applications due to its relatively short key length. DES keys are only 56 bits, providing an exhaustive search space of 2^56 possible keys. This means an attacker can check all possible keys in less time than it would take to transmit the cipher text across the network. For these reasons, modern cryptographic protocols such as AES should be used.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES."
