The provided code is not susceptible to any known vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that the DES algorithm is known to be weak and is no longer considered secure for modern applications. You may want to replace it with a stronger algorithm like AES.

Here is the JSON response based on this context:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Weak Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(keyAlgo);",
        "description": "The DES algorithm is known to be weak and vulnerable to attacks. It is recommended to use a stronger encryption algorithm like AES.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'DES' with a stronger encryption algorithm like 'AES', and if necessary, adjust the key size to 256 bits."
    }
]
```
