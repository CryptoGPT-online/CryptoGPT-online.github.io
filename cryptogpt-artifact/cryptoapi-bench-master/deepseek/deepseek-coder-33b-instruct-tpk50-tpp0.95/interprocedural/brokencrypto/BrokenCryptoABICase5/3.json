Here are the potential security misuses in the given Java code:

1. No confidentiality or integrity of sensitive data during cryptographic operations.

Vulnerable Code:
```java
public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding";
private static char[] CRYPTO;
private static char[] crypto;

public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO_ALGO = "DES";
private static char[] CRYPTO_ALGO;
private static char[] crypto_algo;

private static void go2(){
    CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
    CRYPTO_ALGO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO_ALGO.toCharArray();
}

private static void go3(){
    crypto = CRYPTO;
    crypto_algo = CRYPTO_ALGO;
}
```
Description: The `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` and `DEFAULT_CRYPTO_ALGO` are hardcoded, and the `crypto` and `crypto_algo` are assigned with the `CRYPTO` and `CRYPTO_ALGO` respectively, which are public static final strings. The sensitive information isn't properly protected during cryptographic operations.

Recommendation: To mitigate the risk of the insecure use of crypto API, the sensitive information (crypto algorithm, key, etc.) should be protected properly. Don't expose the sensitive information in the code, and keep the sensitive information in secure storage like secret storage or environment variables.

2. Possibility of insecure default configuration used.

Vulnerable Code:
```java
public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding";
public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO_ALGO = "DES";
```

Description: The `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` and `DEFAULT_CRYPTO_ALGO` are hardcoded. This is not secure because DES and ECB are not considered secure anymore.

Recommendation: Consider using AES for symmetric encryption and GCM mode for authenticated encryption. It's also recommended to use a random IV in each encryption operation. If the code needs to support Java 6 or earlier, then consider using "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" for CBC mode encryption or AES/GCM/NoPadding for GCM mode encryption.

3. Lack of randomness in key generation.

Vulnerable Code:
```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto_algo));
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
```

Description: The key is generated using a key generator with a non-random seed. This is not secure as a predictable key can lead to an easier guess or brute force attack.

Recommendation: Always use a secure random generator to generate cryptographic keys.

4. Unsecure storage of the key.

Vulnerable Code:
```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
```

Description: The key is stored as a class field and used for encryption. If the key is stolen, the attacker can decrypt the data.

Recommendation: Always encrypt keys and protect the key material in the most secured way possible.

5. Use of weak padding.

Vulnerable Code:
```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
```

Description: `PKCS5Padding` is not recommended for use with block ciphers because it involves using the entire length of the block. This is insecure if the data itself is smaller than the block size.

Recommendation: Consider using an authenticated mode of encryption, like GCM, which provides both confidentiality and integrity in a single operation.
