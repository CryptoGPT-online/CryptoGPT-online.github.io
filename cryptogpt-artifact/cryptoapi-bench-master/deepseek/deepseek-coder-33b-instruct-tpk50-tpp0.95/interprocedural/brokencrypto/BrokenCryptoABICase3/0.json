Misuse: Broken Crypto Algorithm
vulnerable_code: `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);` and `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);`
description: The cryptographic algorithm RC4 was broken, its use is therefore highly discouraged.
recommendation: Switch to an AES, TripleDES, or RSA instead of RC4. Also, ensure that the key length and other parameters are appropriate for the chosen algorithm.
