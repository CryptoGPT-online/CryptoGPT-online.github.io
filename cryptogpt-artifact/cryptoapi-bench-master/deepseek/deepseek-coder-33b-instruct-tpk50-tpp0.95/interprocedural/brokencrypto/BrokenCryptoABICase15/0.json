Here are the findings:

1. Usage of IDEA Algorithm:
The use of IDEA Algorithm is a misuse which violates the principle of not using insecure or weak cryptographic algorithm (CWE-321). IDEA is considered weak now and it's no longer recommended to use it in new designs. Its successor is Blowfish.

```java
// Vulnerable Code
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
```

Description: IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a symmetric-key block cipher, but it's not recommended for use because it's considered weak. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has formally deprecated it in favor of Blowfish.

Recommendation: Use a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of IDEA.

2. Key Generation:
The code generated a key in method1 but the key is never used. This is a misuse of CWE-327, which is about generating keys without any specific uses. 

```java
// Vulnerable Code
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
```

Description: Key generation without specific uses can lead to potential misuse of the keys.

Recommendation: Use the key for encrypting or decrypting messages.
