        "description": "The use of the Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode of operation is insecure as it does not hide data patterns and the same data will always encrypt to the same value. This can leak sensitive information and should not be used without understanding the implication.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using other modes like CBC, CFB, OFB or CTR. CTR mode should be used if you need authenticated encryption as it provides both confidentiality and integrity."
