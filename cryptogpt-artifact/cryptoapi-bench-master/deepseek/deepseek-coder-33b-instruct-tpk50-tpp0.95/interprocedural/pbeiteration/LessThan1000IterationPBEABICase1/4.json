        "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The code provided is generating a PBEParameterSpec object which is meant to be used for Password Based Encryption (PBE). However, the value used for count (20 in this case) is considered a weak value in practice. This weak value may lead to decreased encryption strength, making the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "For stronger encryption, a higher iteration count should be used. A commonly used value is 10000. This value provides a good balance between computational efficiency and security."
