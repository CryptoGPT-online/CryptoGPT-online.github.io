There are several issues with this code, including:

1. The `DEFAULT_COUNT` is declared as a `String` but is used as an `Integer` in the `PBEParameterSpec`.
2. The `count` is used before being initialized in the `go3()` method, which means it can be null.
3. The `DEFAULT_COUNT` value "20" is used directly without any validation or sanitization, which can lead to potential misuse.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```java
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEParameterSpec;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class L2 {
    public static final String DEFAULT_COUNT = "20";
    private static char[] COUNT;
    private static char[] count;
    public static void main(){
        L2 lt = new L2();
        go2();
        go3();
        lt.key2();
    }
    private static void go2(){
        COUNT = DEFAULT_COUNT.toCharArray();
    }
    private static void go3(){
        count = COUNT;
    }
    public void key2(){
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        byte[] salt = new byte[32];
        random.nextBytes(salt);

        int iterationCount = 0;
        try {
            iterationCount = Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            // Handle the error.
        }

        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, iterationCount);
    }
}
```

This version of the code fixes the issues above and makes sure that the `DEFAULT_COUNT` is correctly converted to an `Integer` before being used in `PBEParameterSpec`. It also initializes the `count` variable before it's used in `PBEParameterSpec`. The code also includes a try-catch block to handle the `NumberFormatException` that may occur when parsing the `count` as an integer.
