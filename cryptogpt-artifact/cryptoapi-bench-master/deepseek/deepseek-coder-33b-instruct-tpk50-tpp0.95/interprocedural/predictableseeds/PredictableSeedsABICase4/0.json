The misuse in the code is as follows:

```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});
```

The `SecureRandom` class's constructor takes a byte array as an argument. However, in this code, we are passing a byte array containing a single element that is obtained from `seed` array which is a character array (char[]). This leads to incorrect conversion of characters to bytes, as characters are encoded in UTF-8.

This could result in a loss of information and incorrect seed for `SecureRandom`.

Here is how you can fix it:

```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(DEFAULT_SEED)});
```

This way, we are passing the default seed directly as byte.

Here is the correct JSON format response:

```json

    "misuse": "Misuse in the usage of SecureRandom's constructor",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
