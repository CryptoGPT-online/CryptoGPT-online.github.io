Misuses:

1. Insecure Random Seed: 
Misuse Code: `SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});`
Description: This is a misuse because the seed is directly derived from a string, which could cause a security risk. If the string contains predictable values, or if a user can provide an input that will result in a predictable seed, then the PRNG might be insecure.
Recommendation: Avoid using a string directly as a seed for a PRNG. Instead, use a strong source of randomness (e.g., /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems) or a secure PRNG with a secure seed.

2. Unbounded Loop in `go2` method:
Misuse Code: `SEED = DEFAULT_SEED.toCharArray();`
Description: There is no check in the `go2` method to ensure that the length of the seed does not exceed the maximum length of the seed used by the SecureRandom class. If the seed is too long, it could cause problems.
Recommendation: Add a check in the `go2` method to ensure that the length of the seed does not exceed the maximum length of the seed used by the SecureRandom class.

3. Unbounded Loop in `go3` method:
Misuse Code: `seed = SEED;`
Description: There is no check in the `go3` method to ensure that the length of the seed does not exceed the maximum length of the seed used by the SecureRandom class. If the seed is too long, it could cause problems.
Recommendation: Add a check in the `go3` method to ensure that the length of the seed does not exceed the maximum length of the seed used by the SecureRandom class.
