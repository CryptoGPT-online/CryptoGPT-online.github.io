The provided code does not have any security issue from a crypto API misuse perspective. 

However, it does show a misuse of the SecureRandom class. When it is set a seed, it should not be done during runtime. The seed is intended to initialize a pseudorandom number generator and a static seed does not make the generated numbers truly random. 

Here's the corrected code snippet and explanation:

```java
public class P1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};
        go(seed);
    }
    private static void go(byte [] seed) {
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(seed); // Use the seed here instead of runtime seeding
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

In the corrected version, the seed is set during initialization of the SecureRandom instance. This way, every time you generate a random number, you are not using a static seed, but the seed specified during the creation of the SecureRandom object.

It's worth mentioning that SecureRandom should only be used when strong randomness is necessary. For most applications, the Random class, even though not cryptographically strong, will be sufficient and faster.
