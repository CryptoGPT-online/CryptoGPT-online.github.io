The code provided does not have any obvious misuse of crypto API. It uses `SecureRandom` class correctly, it sets a seed, and then generates random integers. The use of `SecureRandom` is considered secure and commonly accepted.

However, please be aware of the following considerations:

- The seed provided could be predictable. The seed should ideally be unpredictable to avoid predictable random numbers. In this case, the seed could be easily guessed or known.
- It is not recommended to use static variables to hold sensitive information like the seed. In this case, the seed is a constant, but it could be a variable if it was user input.
