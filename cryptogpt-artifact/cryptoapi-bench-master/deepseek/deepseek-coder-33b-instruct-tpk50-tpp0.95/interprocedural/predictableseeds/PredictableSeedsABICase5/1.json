The code provided does not have any misuses related to CWE-256, 295, 297, 321, 326, 327, 338, 547, 650, 757, 759 and 760. 

Here is the code annotated for better understanding:
```java
public class P5 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        // The seed is provided as a byte array 
        byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};
        method1(seed);
    }

    public static void method1(byte[] s) {
        // The seed from main() is passed to method1 where a new seed variable is created with the same byte array.
        byte [] seed2 = s;
        method2(seed2);
    }

    private static void method2(byte [] seed) {
        // The seed from method1 is passed to method2, where a SecureRandom object is created and its seed is set.
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.setSeed(seed);
        // The SecureRandom object is then used to generate a random integer.
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        // The generated random integer is then printed to the console.
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```
The code does not violate any crypto API misuses that I have mentioned. It is correctly using the `SecureRandom` class to generate a random number using a seed provided by the user. The seed is not created from a system-dependent value (like system time) and does not depend on insecure system random number generators.
