The code you've provided appears to be Java, and it doesn't seem to have any specific cryptographic issues that would violate any well-known cryptographic security standards. However, there is a potential issue that may impact the system's security or make it insecure.

The code is using the `toString()` method on an array of characters to convert it into a string, and then to a byte array. This can potentially leak sensitive data and may not be intended behavior, depending on the actual use of the code.

Additionally, the key is truncated or padded to a fixed length of 16 bytes. While this may not directly affect the security of the cipher, it can potentially leak information about the original key.

In terms of crypto API misuses, these issues can lead to a variety of problems, including potential key exposure or even weak encryption. Therefore, the following JSON response suggests the possible misuses:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Misuse of 'toString' method on char array",
        "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();",
        "description": "The 'toString' method may expose sensitive data, especially when used on an array of characters. This can be a potential security risk if sensitive data was stored in the char array.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid using the 'toString' method on an array of characters unless it is explicitly intended to convert the array to a String for display or other non-security related purposes."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Key truncation or padding",
        "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
        "description": "The key is being truncated or padded to a fixed length of 16 bytes. This can potentially leak information about the original key and can negatively affect the strength of the encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of truncating or padding the key, consider using a cryptographic padding scheme, such as PKCS7, which is secure and does not leak information about the original key."
    }
]
```
