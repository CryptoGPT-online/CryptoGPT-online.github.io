The code provided has a misuse related to Broken Crypto Algorithm. The problem is with the line where the SecretKeySpec object is created. The `toString()` method is being called on `encryptKey` which is a `char[]` array. When `toString()` is called, it will return a `String` representation of the `encryptKey` array. 

`toString()` method in Java is used for any object and it will always returns the String representation of an object which is its class name followed by @ and the hash code in hexadecimal form. In this case, it returns something like: `"[C@5e2de807"`. The `toString()` method is not designed to convert the contents of a char array to a string. Therefore, calling `toString()` on `encryptKey` array will not return the actual content as the programmer might expect.

Here's the JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();",
        "description": "The use of `toString()` method on a char array directly can result in loss of information as it returns the String representation of the char array, not its contents",
        "recommendation": "Create a new String from the char array before converting it to bytes: `new String(encryptKey).getBytes()`"
    }
]
```
