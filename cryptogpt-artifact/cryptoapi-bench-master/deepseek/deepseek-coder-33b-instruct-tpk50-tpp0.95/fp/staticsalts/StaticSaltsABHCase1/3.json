Here are the identified security issues:

1. PBEParameterSpec has been instantiated with Byte object (byte) as salt, which is insecure as salt should be a random value.

```java
byte b = hm.get("aaa");
byte[] salt = {b,b};
int count = 1020;
pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
```

The JSON response:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");\nbyte[] salt = {b,b};\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The salt should be a randomly generated value for each password. Using non-random values can lead to predictable keys and broken crypto algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of hard-coding the salt, consider generating a random salt with SecureRandom. You may also want to consider the use of an algorithm like KeyGenerator for generating symmetric keys, which automatically uses a secure random source."

```
