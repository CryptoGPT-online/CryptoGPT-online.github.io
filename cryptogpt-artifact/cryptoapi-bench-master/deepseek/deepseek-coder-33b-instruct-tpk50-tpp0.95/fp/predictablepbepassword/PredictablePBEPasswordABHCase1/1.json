The misuse in this code is "Broken Cryptography: Insecure Random Number Generation for Pseudo Random Number Generator".

Misuse Type: Broken Cryptography: Insecure Random Number Generation for Pseudo Random Number Generator

Misuse Code Snippets:
```java
byte [] salt = new byte[16];
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
sr.nextBytes(salt);
```

Description: The code uses an insecure pseudo random number generator to generate the random salt used in password-based encryption (PBE). The insecure random number generator may not produce high entropy, which in turn reduces the security of the generated keys.

Recommendation: Instead of using the insecure SecureRandom for generating the salt, it is recommended to use the Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE) framework or implement a key derivation function to enhance the security of your keys.
