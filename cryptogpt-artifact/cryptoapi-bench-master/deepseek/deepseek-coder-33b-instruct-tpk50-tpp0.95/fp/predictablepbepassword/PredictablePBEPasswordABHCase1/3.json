There are a few cryptographic misuses present in the given code:

1. Use of SecureRandom to generate salt: SecureRandom should be used to generate random bytes, not to generate strings or integers. In this case, it's being used to generate salt but this is not the intended use.

2. Passing salt directly into PBEKeySpec constructor: The salt should never be converted into a string before passing it into the PBEKeySpec constructor. The salt should always be a byte array.

3. Use of insecure iteration count for PBE: The current iteration count (11010) for PBE is relatively low and may be too insecure for some uses. It is generally recommended to use a count of at least 10,000 for PBE.

4. Use of a fixed key length: In this case, the key length is fixed to 16 bytes. This is generally not a good practice as it makes the keys shorter, which reduces their effective strength.

5. Storing the PBEKeySpec: Even though this code doesn't directly expose this to outside, it's a bad practice to directly store sensitive data like PBEKeySpec. 

Here's how you might improve the code:

```java
public class P1 {
    private PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = null;

    public static void main(String [] args) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        P1 ckp = new P1();
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte [] keyBytes = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(keyBytes);
        ckp.key(keyBytes);
    }
    public void key(byte [] keyBytes) {
        byte [] salt = new byte[16];
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.nextBytes(salt);
        int iterationCount = 10000;
        pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(keyBytes, salt, iterationCount, keyBytes.length * 8);
    }
}
```

This code corrects the aforementioned misuses. The salt is now generated via SecureRandom. The iteration count is increased to a reasonable value. The key length is determined dynamically based on the size of the key. The salt is stored directly as a byte array, without conversion to a string.
