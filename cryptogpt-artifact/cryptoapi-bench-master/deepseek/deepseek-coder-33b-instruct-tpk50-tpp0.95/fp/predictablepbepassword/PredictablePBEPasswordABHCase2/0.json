This code is using PBE (Password-Based Encryption) with a hardcoded number of iterations (11010), which is generally considered insecure due to the following reasons:

1. PBE is an algorithm designed to be slow (as much as desired) to discourage brute force attacks. A higher iteration count will reduce the speed of the algorithm, making it less attractive to brute force attacks. However, a high iteration count also means it will take longer to hash the password. This could potentially make your application slower than necessary.

2. There is no evidence of managing exceptions in your code. The 'nextBytes' method can throw 'NoSuchAlgorithmException'. You should handle this appropriately.

3. The length of the key is set to 16, which is generally the minimum key size needed. This is too short and can lead to security vulnerabilities.
