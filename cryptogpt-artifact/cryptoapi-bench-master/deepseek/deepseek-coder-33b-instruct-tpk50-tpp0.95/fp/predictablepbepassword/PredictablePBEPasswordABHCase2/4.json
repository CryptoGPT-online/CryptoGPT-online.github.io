There are a few potential misuses in your code. The most significant one is with PBEKeySpec:

1. The iteration count in the PBEKeySpec is not constant, it is set to a variable value. It is recommended to use a constant iteration count or a predefined value to avoid issues with brute force attacks.

2. The key length for PBEKeySpec is 16 bytes which is not secure as per OWASP recommendations for cryptographic algorithm. This is generally less than the recommended key length of 32 bytes.

Here is your code after addressing these misuses:

```java
public class P2 {
    private PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = null;
    private PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;

    public static void main(String [] args){
        P2 ckp = new P2();
        Map<String,String> hm = new HashMap<String, String>();
        hm.put("aaa", "afix");
        hm.put("bbb", "bfix");
        hm.put("ccc", "cfix");
        hm.put("ddd", "dfix");

        String key = hm.get("aaa");
        ckp.key(key);
    }
    public void key(String key) {
        byte [] salt = new byte[16];
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.nextBytes(salt);
        int iterationCount = 10000; // Constant iteration count
        int keyLength = 256; // Recommended key length for AES
        pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(key.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);
    }
}
```

Please note: Be sure to choose a good iteration count that balances security and performance. Also, you should not use PBKDF2 for password hashing, since it is susceptible to brute-force attacks due to the lack of salt. Please consider using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) or bcrypt instead.
