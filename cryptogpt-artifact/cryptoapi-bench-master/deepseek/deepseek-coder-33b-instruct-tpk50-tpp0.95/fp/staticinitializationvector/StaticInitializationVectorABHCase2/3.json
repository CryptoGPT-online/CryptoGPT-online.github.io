Misuse: Insecure Initialization of Cipher Mode
vulnerable_code: `cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec);`
description: In this snippet, the cipher is initialized with the AES/CBC mode, but without providing a random IV. If an attacker can figure out the contents of the plaintext, the IV can be used to reveal the key, leading to information leakage.
recommendation: Always use a randomly generated IV for each encryption. You can use `SecureRandom` for this purpose.

```java
SecureRandom randomSecureRandom = new SecureRandom();
byte[] iv = new byte[16];
randomSecureRandom.nextBytes(iv);
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec);
```

Please make sure to also store and protect the IV when using it for decryption.
