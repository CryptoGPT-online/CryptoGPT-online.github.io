Misuse: Weak IV generation with KeyGenerator
vulnerable_code: 
```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
```
description: Using KeyGenerator to generate key can lead to weak IV generation. It's better to use SecureRandom for IV generation.
recommendation: Use SecureRandom to generate IV. Here is the corrected code:
```java
SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
byte[] iv = new byte[16];
secureRandom.nextBytes(iv);
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
```

Please note that, since this is a simple example, the usage of weak IV is not critical in this case, because no sensitive information is being encrypted. However, in a real world scenario, it is crucial to use a secure way to generate the IV to ensure the security of encryption.
