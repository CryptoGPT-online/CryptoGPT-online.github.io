There are a few misuses in the given code related to Cryptographic API misuses.

1. The IV (Initialization Vector) is shared among multiple instances, which is an insecure practice. If a malicious party obtains the IV, he can decrypt the encrypted messages.

2. The KeyGenerator class is used without any SecureRandom instance, which may lead to a lack of randomness, and potentially lead to predictable keys.

The recommendations are:

1. Generate a new IV for each encryption operation.

2. Use a SecureRandom instance with KeyGenerator for generating keys.

Here is the JSON response:
