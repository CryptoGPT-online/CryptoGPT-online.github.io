There is no specific crypto misuse in this code, however, it does contain a couple of potential security misuses.

1. The use of SecureRandom to generate the salt can potentially be vulnerable. It's important to ensure that SecureRandom is properly seeded. 

2. The salt used to generate the key is only 32 bytes in size. This could potentially lead to weak encryption if the key is only 32 bits long.

Here is the suggested fix for these issues:

```java
public class L1 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        L1 lt = new L1();
        lt.key2();
    }
    public void key2(){
        String name = "abcdef";
        Map<String,Integer> hm = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
        hm.put("aaa", new Integer(1020));
        hm.put("bbb", new Integer(20));

        int iteration = hm.get("bbb");

        SecureRandom random = null;
        try {
            random = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong();
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        byte[] salt = new byte[64]; //increasing salt size to 64 bytes
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, iteration);
    }
}
```

Please note that these are general suggestions. Always consult with a security expert when implementing cryptography.
