The provided code snippet has a misuse of cryptographic API. 

Misuse: Predictable KeyStore Password

The code is using a predictable key (from a hardcoded hashmap) as the keystore password. The key "aaa" corresponds to "afix" in the hashmap. If an attacker can guess this key, they could potentially decrypt the keystore.

Vulnerable code:

```
String key = hm.get("aaa");

KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);
cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com");
ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());
```

Description: 

Using a predictable key as a password for a keystore is not secure as it can be easily guessed or brute forced. In the provided code, the keystore password is determined by the value of the "aaa" key in the hashmap, which is set as a hardcoded string "afix". This could be easily discovered or bruteforced by attackers.

Recommendation:

To fix this misuse, the keystore password should not be predictable or hardcoded. It should be randomly generated and stored securely. In addition, the use of the "aaa" key as the password for the keystore is unnecessary. It is better to randomly generate a secure password and use that.
