[{"misuse": "Predictable KeyStore Password", "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());", "description": "The KeyStore instance is being loaded with a predictable password (key.toCharArray()). Using a weak or predictable password for a KeyStore significantly reduces the security of the application. A malicious actor could potentially guess or brute-force this password and gain access to the KeyStore's content.", "recommendation": "Use a strong, random, secret key to encrypt and decrypt the KeyStore. Consider using a cryptographic service that can manage keys for you."}]
