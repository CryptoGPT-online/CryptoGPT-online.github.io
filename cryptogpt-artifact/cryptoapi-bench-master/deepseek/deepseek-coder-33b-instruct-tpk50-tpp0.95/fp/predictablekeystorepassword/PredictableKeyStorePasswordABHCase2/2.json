The code you've posted doesn't contain any specific cryptographic API misuses. However, you should be aware of the following points:

1. A cryptographic algorithm, in this case "JKS" (Java KeyStore), is used.

2. The KeyStore instance is instantiated and loaded with the JKS type and a predictable password ("key.toCharArray()"), which could be considered a misuse. If the password is discovered or guessed, the keystore could be compromised.

3. The JKS file is loaded over a network connection (from the URL "https://www.google.com"), which could also be a security risk. 

4. The HashMap "hm" is created with hardcoded passwords. 

Here's the response in JSON format:
