        "description": "Using a predictable seed value in SecureRandom can lead to security vulnerabilities. The seed is a key in the generation of random numbers, thus a predictable seed leads to the generation of predictable random numbers. This may lead to security risks when sensitive information requires a random seed.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting a predictable seed value. Instead, use SecureRandom to generate a seed value when you need one. For example, instead of using 'new SecureRandom()' , use 'SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()', which is a factory for creating strong random number generators. These generators are intended to provide secure random numbers for cryptographic operations."
