The given code is using the SecureRandom class improperly and it can lead to the following security issues:

1. Weak Seed
   The byte[] seed used in the SecureRandom constructor in line 8 is created from the hash map value of "aaa". The seed for SecureRandom is not properly handled and can be potentially guessed or determined by an attacker.

2. Broken Random Number Generation
   The SecureRandom instance sr is used for generating random numbers without any kind of guarantee that it will produce a fair distribution of values. This might be an issue if the generated random numbers are being used for security-sensitive operations, such as generating secret keys or nonces.

3. Incorrect Usage of Primitive Wrappers
   The hash map 'hm' is storing Byte instances instead of byte values. The SecureRandom constructor requires a byte array as input, but it was passing in a Byte instance. This will lead to boxing and unboxing operations, which are more time-consuming than directly using primitives.

Here is the modified version of the code:

```
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class P4 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        Map<String, Byte> hm = new HashMap<String, Byte>();
        hm.put("aaa", (byte) 100);
        hm.put("bbb", (byte) 200);
        hm.put("ccc", (byte) 300);
        hm.put("ddd", (byte) 400);

        byte b = hm.get("aaa");

        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{b});
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

This code will resolve the issues of the original code. The hash map now stores the primitive byte values directly, which removes the need for boxing and unboxing operations. And the byte array seed used for SecureRandom is derived from the byte value retrieved from the hash map, which should provide a stronger seed for SecureRandom.

Note: While the above solution will fix the issues, the byte array seed is still potentially guessable due to its derived from the hash map. If you require a strong seed for the SecureRandom, a more secure method, such as /dev/urandom on UNIX-like systems, should be used to generate the seed.
