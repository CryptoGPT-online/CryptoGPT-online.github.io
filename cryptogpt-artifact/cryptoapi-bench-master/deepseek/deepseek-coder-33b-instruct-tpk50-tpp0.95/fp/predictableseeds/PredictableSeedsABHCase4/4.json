Here is the response in JSON format:

[
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Seed Generation",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;\nString str = String.valueOf(random.ints());\nbyte[] seed = str.getBytes();",
    "description": "A seed of a pseudorandom number generator should ideally come from a secure random number generator to ensure its randomness and security. This code generates a seed by converting a random integer to a string and then back to bytes, which may not produce a secure random seed.",
    "recommendation": "Use a SecureRandom instance to generate the seed, as shown in the given code."
  }
]
