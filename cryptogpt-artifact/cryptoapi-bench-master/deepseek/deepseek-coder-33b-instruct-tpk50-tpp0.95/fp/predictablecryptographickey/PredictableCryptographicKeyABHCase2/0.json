Your code is using a string as a secret key in AES encryption. This is a significant security vulnerability as using a small or non-random key could lead to easy decryption. Moreover, using a string directly as a key can lead to issues if the string changes, since the ciphertext will no longer decrypt properly.

Here is the vulnerable code:

```java
String key = hm.get("aaa");
byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();
keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);
SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
```

The recommended solution would be to use a secure random number generator to generate the secret key. The secret key should be of a specific size for the AES algorithm. For AES, the key size must be 16 bytes.

Here is the recommended solution:

```java
byte[] keyBytes = new byte[16];
SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
secureRandom.nextBytes(keyBytes);
SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
```

Note: You need to replace the old line where the secret key is created, you should use the SecureRandom class in Java. It provides a cryptographically strong random number which can be used to create a secure secret key.
