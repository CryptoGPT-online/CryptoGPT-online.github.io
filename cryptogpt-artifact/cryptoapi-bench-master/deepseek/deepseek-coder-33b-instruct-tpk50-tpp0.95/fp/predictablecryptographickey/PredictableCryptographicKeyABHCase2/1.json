The code you provided is not directly vulnerable to any security issues but it could lead to security issues if used in a certain context. For example, if it's used for encryption/decryption in a data handling system where the key is sensitive.

The code is taking a string from a HashMap and converting it into a byte array. The byte array is then padded or truncated to 16 bytes which is the block size of AES. This operation is commonly known as "key strengthening" which can lead to vulnerabilities.

AES block size is 16 bytes. It's okay to truncate a key to exactly 16 bytes, but it's not recommended to pad a key shorter than 16 bytes. Padding short keys could lead to vulnerabilities since the padding is a sensitive part of the key. 

However, using a weak key could be a serious problem. If an attacker can somehow obtain the key, he or she can decrypt the encrypted data. So, it's crucial to use a strong key. 

Here is a modified version of your code:

```java
public class P2 {
    public static void main(String [] args) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {

        Map<String,String> hm = new HashMap<String, String>();
        hm.put("aaa", "afix");
        hm.put("bbb", "bfix");
        hm.put("ccc", "cfix");
        hm.put("ddd", "dfix");

        String key = hm.get("aaa");

        byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes("UTF-8");
        keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);

        MessageDigest sha = null;
        try {
            sha = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1");
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        keyBytes = sha.digest(keyBytes);
        keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes, 16); // use only first 128 bits

        SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
    }
}
```

In this version of the code, I've used a SHA-1 hash to strengthen the key. Additionally, I've used only the first 128 bits of the SHA-1 hash to produce a 16-byte key for AES. This is still not a strong key, but it should be much less vulnerable to the known plaintext attack than the original key. 

Remember that this is just an example. The best way to secure sensitive keys depends on the specific requirements of your application.
