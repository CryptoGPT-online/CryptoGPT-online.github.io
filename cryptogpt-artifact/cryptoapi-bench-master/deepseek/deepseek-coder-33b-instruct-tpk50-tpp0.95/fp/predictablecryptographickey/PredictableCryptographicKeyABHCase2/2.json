There are two potential cryptographic misuses in this code:

1. The use of the raw string as a secret key is not secure. The code retrieves a string from the HashMap using a predefined key ("aaa"), then converts this string to a byte array using its getBytes() method, and finally truncates this byte array to be exactly 16 bytes long. This truncated array is then used as a secret key for an AES cipher. This is a misuse of CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key. 

2. The use of an insecure random number generator may cause unpredictable keys. The java.security.SecureRandom class can be used to generate secure random keys instead of using Arrays.copyOf() to truncate a byte array, as it generates random values rather than static ones. This is a misuse of CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).

Here's the JSON response:
