The code you provided uses the PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm, specifically, the PBEParameterSpec class. This is a secure approach for password-based encryption. However, it is not clear from your code whether this is being used in conjunction with an encryption algorithm such as DES, AES, or any other cipher.

Here are the concerns and recommendations for this code:

1. No Encryption Algorithm Used: PBE itself is not an encryption algorithm, but a password-based encryption scheme. Therefore, it is crucial to use an encryption algorithm such as DES, AES, or any other cipher to encrypt data.
2. PBEParameterSpec Salt Length Limited: The salt used in PBEParameterSpec should be at least 64 bits long for security reasons, although it is not checked in this code.

Here is the corrected code, assuming you'd want to use DES encryption:

```java
public class S1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        S1 cs = new S1();
        cs.key2();
    }

    public void key2(){
        SecretKeyFactory factory = null;
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2, (byte) 0xa2}; // Salt should be at least 8 bytes long for DES
        int count = 1020;
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);

        // Assuming DES encryption here
        // Replace "DES" with your preferred encryption algorithm
        KeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec("password".toCharArray(), salt, count, 56); // 56 bits DES
        SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(keySpec);
        SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), "DES");

        // Use the SecretKey for your actual encryption/decryption tasks
    }
}
```

Please, adjust the salt length and strength according to your requirements.

NOTE: The code above uses PBE for password-based encryption, but it does not use secure password handling. Never hardcode your passwords like this in the code.
