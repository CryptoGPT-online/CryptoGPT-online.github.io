This code does not perform any insecure use of cryptographic API. The PBEParameterSpec is used correctly for the Password-Based Encryption algorithm, which includes PBEWith<Algorithm>, where Algorithm is DES, RC2 or RC5. The salt is used in the PBEParameterSpec, a parameter spec for password-based key derivation. The count is also used in the PBEParameterSpec to determine the number of iterations for the key derivation function.
