The provided code is creating an SSL connection to "my.host.name" on port 443. However, this code does not perform any kind of cryptographic operation or use cryptographic protocol.

If you need to establish a secure connection and then use cryptographic protocols like SSL/TLS, then you would typically use SSLSocket to connect to a server and then create an input and output stream to send and receive data over the network.

If you need to use cryptographic operations, you need to implement these operations after you establish a secure connection. For example:

```java
SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket("my.host.name", 443);

// Now use cryptographic protocols
```

Please note that without any cryptographic operations, this code cannot present any cryptographic misuse.
