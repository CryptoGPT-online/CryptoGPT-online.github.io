     "description": "The provided code is insecure because it allows all SSL/TLS connections to proceed regardless of the certificate presented by the server, including those from untrusted or invalid sources. This can potentially allow an attacker to decrypt the traffic.",
     "recommendation": "The code should not simply return true for all host names. Instead, it should verify the SSL certificate presented by the server. Use standard cryptographic functions such as those provided by the SSLContext class, or consider using a third-party library that offers certificate validation."
