    "description": "The provided code disables certificate verification entirely. This can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack where a malicious entity can pretend to be a trusted server. This is particularly dangerous because sensitive information could be transmitted between the client and server without any security.",
    "recommendation": "Always use certificate verification to ensure the client is connecting to the correct server. If you need to accept self-signed certificates, consider using a custom TrustManager that trusts only those specific certificates. Do not accept any other certificates without verifying they are indeed signed by a trusted authority."
