    "description": "The given method overrides the `verify` method in the `HostnameVerifier` interface. This method is used to verify the hostname in an SSL handshake and should only return true if the hostname matches the one expected. However, this method is hardcoded to always return true, which means it is not checking if the hostname is correct or not. This can lead to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "It is highly recommended to verify the hostname in the SSL handshake. You can refer to the official Android documentation on how to do this securely. Incorrect hostname verification can lead to serious security issues."
