  "description": "The code snippet checks if the hostname is equal to \"192.168.0.10\". This is an insecure approach since it allows only a specific hostname instead of checking the whole network. In a production environment, it's recommended to use a secure hostname verification method.",
  "recommendation": "Consider implementing a more secure hostname verification method that checks the whole hostname or uses a certificate pinning mechanism."
