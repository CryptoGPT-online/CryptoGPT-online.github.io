        "description": "This code is attempting to load a KeyStore with an insecure password. Insecure passwords can be easily guessed, which is a significant security risk. Additionally, 'random' password generation may lead to predictable passwords, which could pose a risk to the security of the KeyStore.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a strong, random password for the KeyStore. You could use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Use a library or framework that provides secure random number generation for password generation. It's also a good practice to store the password securely."
