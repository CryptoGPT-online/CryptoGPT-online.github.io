The misuses in the code include:

1. Initialization vector is not securely generated:
Initialization vectors should be randomly generated. However, in the above code, the SecureRandom is used only for generating key bytes. No initialization vector was generated for the cipher.

2. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode is used without initialization vector:
Even if the initialization vector is randomly generated, it's not used in the above code.

The recommended solution is to generate an initialization vector (IV) for CBC mode:

```java
byte[] ivBytes = new byte[16];
SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
secureRandom.nextBytes(ivBytes);
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes);
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec, ivSpec);
```

3. The key is created from a string:
The key is created using a string, which could be guessed if the string is not complex enough.

4. No salt used in key derivation:
If the key is not secure enough, and it may be brute-forced or guessed, a salt should be used to increase security.

In summary, the security of cryptographic operations is very important, and following best practices is highly recommended to prevent misuse and ensure secure implementations.
