The provided code is insecure due to the following reasons:

1. The iteration count is too low which may decrease the security of the encryption algorithm and increase the likelihood of brute force attacks. It is recommended to use a minimum of 1000 iterations.

2. The default key is used directly in the PBEKeySpec, without any form of normalization. This weak key can be easily guessed and lead to security vulnerabilities.

Here is the JSON representation of the vulnerabilities:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Low Iteration Count",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to 11010 which is very low and may decrease the security of the encryption algorithm and increase the likelihood of brute force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a minimum of 1000 iterations."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Weak Key",
        "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"saagar\";",
        "description": "The key used in the PBEKeySpec is a weak, predictable value which can be easily guessed. This makes the encryption vulnerable to brute force attacks and dictionary attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid using weak keys. Use a randomly generated key or a key derived from a password."
    }
]
