The provided code does not seem to involve any insecure use of crypto API. However, there are few things that are not recommended:

1. The use of hard-coded values like `defaultKey`, `salt`, `iterationCount`, and `keyLength`. It's generally recommended to use some sort of configuration file, environment variables or some other secure means to store these values.

2. The default salt length is 16 bytes which is acceptable for modern applications. However, it's always better to use secure random numbers to generate salts.

3. The iteration count is set to 11010 which is quite low for modern applications. According to NIST SP 800-132 it's recommended to use at least 10000.

In a JSON format, the response might look like this:
