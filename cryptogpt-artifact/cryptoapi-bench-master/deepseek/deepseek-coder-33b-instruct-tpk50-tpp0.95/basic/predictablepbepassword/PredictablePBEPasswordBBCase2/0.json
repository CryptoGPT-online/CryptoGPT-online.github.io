This code is using PBE (Password-Based Encryption) with a potentially weak configuration that is not recommended for secure use. In this code, PBE is being used with a static iteration count (11010) and key length (16). This is considered a low value which is generally too low for any secure use. Also, the default key contains only one character ('s'), which is a weak password and is an even lower value for secure use.

Here is the JSON response:
