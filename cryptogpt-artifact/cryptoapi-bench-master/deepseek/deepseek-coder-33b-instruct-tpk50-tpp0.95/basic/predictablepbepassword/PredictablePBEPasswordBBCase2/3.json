The code you have posted seems fine for most cases, however it's worth noting that PBKDF2 iterations count is generally set quite high (e.g. 10,000 or 100,000) for security purposes. It is often the cause of "Slow PBKDF2 Iterations" or "Hardcoded PBKDF2 iterations" misuse.

Here's the JSON format response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Hardcoded PBKDF2 iterations",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "Setting iterations count too low or hardcoded might decrease security by making the computation easier. A typical iteration count is set around 100,000-1,000,000 for PBKDF2, BCrypt and Argon2.",
        "recommendation": "Consider having the iteration count configured externally from the code, or set it at a high, application-determined level."
    }
]
```
