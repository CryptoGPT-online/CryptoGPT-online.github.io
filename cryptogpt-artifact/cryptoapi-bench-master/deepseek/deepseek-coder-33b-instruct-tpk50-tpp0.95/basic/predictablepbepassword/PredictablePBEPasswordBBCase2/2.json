Here are some potential issues related to crypto API misuse:

1. Insecure iteration count
2. Unsafe salt usage
3. Hard-coded key

Here are the detailed issues and code snippets:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure iteration count",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "Setting a small number of iteration count (11010) makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. It should be at least 1000 for better security.",
        "recommendation": "Set the iteration count to a value which is large enough. For example, at least 10000 iterations."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Unsafe salt usage",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = new byte[16];",
        "description": "The salt is created as a byte array of length 16 which is considered secure for cryptographic purposes. But it is hardcoded and not properly random, which makes the system susceptible to dictionary attacks or pre-computed rainbow tables.",
        "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated salt, instead of hardcoding it. You can generate it as shown in the provided code."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Hard-coded key",
        "vulnerable_code": "char [] defaultKey = {'s'};",
        "description": "The default key is hardcoded as a character array with one element 's'. It is easy to guess and could leave the system vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Do not hardcode the key. Use a randomly generated key or get it from the user. The key should be at least 16 bytes long."
    }
]
```
