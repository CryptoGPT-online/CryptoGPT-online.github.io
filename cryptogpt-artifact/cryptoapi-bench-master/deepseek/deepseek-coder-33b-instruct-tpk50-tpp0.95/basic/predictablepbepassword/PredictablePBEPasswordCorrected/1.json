There are two main misuses in the provided code:

1. Password as String:
The password is generated as a string from a `SecureRandom` instance and it is very insecure because the `SecureRandom` instance generates random numbers and these are converted to a String which is not considered a secure practice. It can be resolved by using a `char[]` array directly.

2. Small iteration count and fixed salt:
The iteration count is quite small (11010) which is not recommended for security purposes. Small iterations count makes the hash computation faster, but it also makes it easier to guess. 
Also, the salt is always the same. If the salt is known, an attacker can use precomputed tables to attempt dictionary attacks.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;

public class Pd {
    private PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = null;
    
    public static void main(String [] args){
        Pd ckp = new Pd();
        ckp.key();
    }
    public void key() {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] password = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(password);
        byte [] salt = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        int iterationCount = 10000; // increased to 10000 for security
        int keyLength = 16;
        pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterationCount, keyLength);
    }
}
```

Please note that this is just an example. The code is still vulnerable because the password is still converted to a `String` which is considered an anti-pattern.

Also, the `PBEKeySpec` should not be stored in the instance variable. It should be used locally within a method and discarded immediately after use.

Lastly, the iteration count should be chosen based on the requirements of the application. The suggested number 10000 is only for demonstration purposes.
