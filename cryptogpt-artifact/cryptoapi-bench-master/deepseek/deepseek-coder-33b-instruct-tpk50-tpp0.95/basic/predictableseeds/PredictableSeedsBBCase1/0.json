The code is safe as it's using SecureRandom class for random number generation which is a secure way of generating random numbers. However, it uses a seed that is provided as an array of bytes. A seed in this case is just an initial value that is used to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is not considered a secret value, but rather a seed to generate the same sequence of random numbers each time the program runs. 

However, the given seed is not a good seed as it's very simple and predictable. Using a well-randomized seed is considered good practice, as it increases the security of the random number generator. For example, SecureRandom#nextBytes or SecureRandom#generateSeed methods can be used to generate a secure seed.

So, here is the recommended modification:

```java
public class P1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        byte [] bytes = new byte[16]; // 16 bytes = 128 bits of randomness
        sr.nextBytes(bytes); // this method uses a more secure way of generating seed
        sr.setSeed(bytes);
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

I hope this clarifies your doubt. If you have further questions, feel free to ask.
