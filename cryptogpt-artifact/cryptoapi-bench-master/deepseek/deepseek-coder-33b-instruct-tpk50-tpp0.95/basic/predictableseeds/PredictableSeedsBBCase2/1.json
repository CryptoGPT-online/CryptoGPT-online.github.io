        "description": "The SecureRandom class relies on an algorithm to generate random numbers, which can vary from system to system. If this algorithm is not cryptographically strong (e.g., PRNGs with small cycle lengths or those with a short internal state), it can be subject to exploitation. In this case, the use of a single byte as seed can also be insecure.",
        "recommendation": "It's recommended to use a secure seed for the SecureRandom class. For example, you could use a value that is generated by a cryptographic algorithm."
