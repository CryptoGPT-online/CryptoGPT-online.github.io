The provided code does not have any crypto API misuse, but it uses a deprecated method to create a new SecureRandom object. The SecureRandom(byte[] seed) constructor is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The correct way to create a SecureRandom object with a specific seed is to use the SecureRandom(byte[] seed) constructor and then manually set the seed using the setSeed(byte[]) method. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public class P2 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        byte seed = 100;
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.setSeed(new byte[]{seed});
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

However, the code still does not use any insecure way of cryptography, but the deprecated way of creating SecureRandom is not a good practice. It is better to use the recommended way to create a SecureRandom object with a specific seed.
