Misuse:
"Reusing PRNG Seed"

Vulnerable Code:
```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
long l = sr.nextLong();
sr.setSeed(l);
int v = sr.nextInt();
```
Description:

In the code above, `SecureRandom` instance is created and a long random number `l` is generated. This `l` is then set as the seed for the `SecureRandom` instance. 

This can lead to predictable PRNG behavior, as the same seed will produce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers. 

If the same seed is used in a secure context, it can expose sensitive information.

Recommendation:

To resolve the misuse, the code should not reuse a seed for the `SecureRandom` instance. Instead, new seeds should be generated each time they are needed. 

For the code provided, the issue can be resolved by just removing the `sr.setSeed(l);` line.
