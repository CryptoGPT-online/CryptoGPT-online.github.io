The code provided is not directly vulnerable to any identified misuses in the Java crypto API, but there are several misuses that should be considered.

1. "SecureRandom with Predictable Seed": It's important to use SecureRandom properly because when you use a predictable seed (like in this case, the same as System.currentTimeMillis()), the generated random numbers are predictable.

2. "Non-Random Seed Used with SecureRandom": It is not recommended to use a non-random seed with SecureRandom because it can lead to predictable results.

Here's the updated version of the code with a random seed:

```java
public class Pd {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.setSeed(System.currentTimeMillis()); // Instead of a predictable seed
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

The updated code uses the current time in milliseconds as a seed for the SecureRandom instance, which is a better way to initialize it.
