Ciphertext stealing (CTS) is a type of block cipher mode where the last block of ciphertext is either a checksum or a copy of the last block of plaintext. It allows the decryption function to recover the last block of plaintext even when the final block of ciphertext is lost. In the context of your code, SealedObject uses CTS for its integrity protection, not for secure encryption.

Here are the recommended corrections:

1. Use AES for the encryption algorithm instead of RSA. RSA is a standard cryptographic algorithm that has been extensively studied and is thought to provide enough security for the required tasks. AES, on the other hand, is widely recognized for its performance and efficiency in encryption and decryption tasks.

2. The encrypted data is being stored in a SealedObject, which is designed to ensure data integrity, not confidentiality. If you want to achieve confidentiality, use an appropriate symmetric key encryption algorithm such as AES. 

3. There's no requirement for padding in RSA encryption. Padding (like OAEP or PKCS1) is normally used with RSA encryption in order to make it resist against certain types of attacks. However, as you are not using RSA, you may eliminate padding from your code.

4. RSA does not require any initialization vector (IV) for encryption. Thus, it's not necessary to use CTS in this context. You should also remove any reference to CTS from your code.

Here's an example of how you can encrypt a plaintext with AES and then decrypt it:

```java
// AES encryption
Cipher encrypt = Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
encrypt.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
byte[] encryptedMessage = encrypt.doFinal(myMessage.getBytes());

// AES decryption
Cipher decrypt = Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
decrypt.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
byte[] decryptedMessage = decrypt.doFinal(encryptedMessage);
String message = new String(decryptedMessage);
System.out.println(message);
```

Please replace `secretKey` with your key generation logic.

In summary, the misuses that your code has are related to the use of RSA instead of AES, the lack of an initialization vector in the context of RSA, and the use of SealedObject for integrity protection instead of confidentiality.

I hope this resolves your concerns. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
