The provided code is using RSA for both encryption and decryption which is not secure. It also encrypts and decrypts the data using a SealedObject, which is usually not necessary for RSA. A simple String encryption and decryption using RSA can be done with the following lines of code:

```java
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, kp.getPublic());
byte[] encryptedMessage = cipher.doFinal(myMessage.getBytes());

cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, kp.getPrivate());
byte[] decryptedMessage = cipher.doFinal(encryptedMessage);

String message = new String(decryptedMessage);
System.out.println(message);
```

In the original code, the SealedObject is being used to encrypt the message which is not needed. Also, RSA is a symmetric encryption algorithm, not asymmetric. Asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA are used for exchanging keys, not for encrypting messages. AES is a better choice for symmetric encryption.
