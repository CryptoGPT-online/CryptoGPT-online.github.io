The provided code is a simple implementation of encryption using AES in ECB mode with PKCS5 padding. However, this code is vulnerable to several different security flaws. The code does not generate random keys and directly generates a Cipher using a fixed AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding algorithm. Here's how it can be fixed:

1. Always specify a provider: Provide the name of the provider as the second argument to the getInstance() method.

2. Always use a random key: The code uses a fixed key which can be easily discovered if the code is not obfuscated. It is recommended to use a random key.

3. Always specify a secure random number generator: KeyGeneration can be a source of security vulnerabilities if it uses the same seed each time. It's best to use a SecureRandom object.

4. Do not use ECB mode: ECB mode is not secure for most purposes. It is vulnerable to patterns and repeated plaintexts.

Here is the modified code to address these issues:

```java
import javax.crypto.*;
import java.security.*;

public class E1 {
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES", "BC");
        keyGen.init(256, random); // 256 bit key
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding", "BC");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(new byte[16]));
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        E1 bc = new E1();
        bc.go();
    }
}
```

In this fixed version of the code, we use a SecureRandom to generate a key for AES. The SecureRandom uses a cryptographically strong random number generator. We also specify the "BC" (Bouncy Castle) provider, which is a reputable and generally well-regarded provider of cryptographic libraries. We've switched to CBC mode instead of ECB mode, which is a more secure mode of operation. 

Please note that the Bouncy Castle provider is not part of the standard Java library, you might need to include it in your project dependencies. 

Also, using CBC mode and providing an Initialization Vector (IV) prevents against the repeat plaintext attack, which ECB mode is susceptible to. The IV should be random for each encryption with the same key. In this example, we've provided an IV of all zeroes for simplicity, but in a real-world application, you would generate a random IV.
