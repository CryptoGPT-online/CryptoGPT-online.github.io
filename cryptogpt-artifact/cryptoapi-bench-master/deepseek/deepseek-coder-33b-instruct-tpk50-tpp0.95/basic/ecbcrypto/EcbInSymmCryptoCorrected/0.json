        "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) is a mode of operation for block ciphers of the symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms. This mode is not semantically secure, because it provides no integrity with input of repeated blocks. It is vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks and can leak information about the key.",
        "recommendation": "Use a mode of operation that provides confidentiality and data integrity, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. In addition, always ensure to use secure random algorithms to generate your keys."
