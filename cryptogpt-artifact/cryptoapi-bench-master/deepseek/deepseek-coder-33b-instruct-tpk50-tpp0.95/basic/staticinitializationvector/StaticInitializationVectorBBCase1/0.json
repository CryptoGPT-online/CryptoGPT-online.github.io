    "description": "The IV (Initialization Vector) is a parameter of the encryption algorithm. It is used to ensure that the same plaintext always encrypts to the same ciphertext and vice versa. Randomly generating the IV can make the encryption algorithm harder to predict and harder to break. In this case, the IV is generated using a KeyGenerator and is not securely generated.",
    "recommendation": "SecureRandom should be used for generating the Initialization Vector. Here is how you can modify the code: SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom(); byte[] iv = new byte[16]; secureRandom.nextBytes(iv); IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);"
