[{"misuse": "Use of Broken Crypto Algorithm (MD4)", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")", "description": "MD4 is a discontinued cryptographic hash function that was developed by Ron Rivest. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning an attacker can generate two different input strings that have the same hash output. This is due to the nature of the hash algorithm itself, not a weakness in the Java implementation.", "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic hash algorithm. Bouncy Castle, for example, offers the SHA-2 family of algorithms, which include SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. You could also use one of the modern secure hash functions like SHA3."}]
