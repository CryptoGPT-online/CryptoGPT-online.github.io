The code provided does not have any obvious cryptographic API misuses. However, it does use the MD4 hash algorithm which is considered to be insecure and it should not be used in practice. In addition, the usage of MD4 is not considered best practice. It is recommended to use secure hash algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-3 or BLAKE2.

Here's the JSON output:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "Use of an insecure hash algorithm (MD4)",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "MD4 is a broken cryptographic hash function. It has known vulnerabilities and is no longer considered secure for any cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using SHA-256, SHA-3 or BLAKE2 instead. You can get a MessageDigest instance using the `getInstance()` method, like so: `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")`."
}]
```
