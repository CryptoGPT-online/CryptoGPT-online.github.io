[{"misuse": "Use of Broken Cryptographic Algorithms (MD4)", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")","description": "The MD4 message-digest algorithm is a hash function that was developed by Ronald Rivest in 1990 and was designed to produce a 128-bit hash value. It has been shown to be insecure and cryptanalytic attacks against the algorithm have been demonstrated.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash function such as SHA-256. You can replace 'MD4' with 'SHA-256' in your code to achieve this."}]
