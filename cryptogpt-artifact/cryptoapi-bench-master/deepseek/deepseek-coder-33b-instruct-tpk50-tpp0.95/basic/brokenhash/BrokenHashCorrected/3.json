Misuse: SHA-256 is not secure

Vulnerable code: 
```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```

Description: SHA-256 is considered to be secure, but certain organizations, especially the U.S. government, have started to phase out its use because it has some known vulnerabilities. This is a misuse because in the event of a security breach, it can be a potential problem, as some weaknesses have been reported. 

Recommendation: Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-3. SHA-3 is considered to be stronger than SHA-2, but it is still under active development and may not be available on all platforms. Consider using a well-vetted and maintained library like Bouncy Castle for more complex cryptographic needs.
