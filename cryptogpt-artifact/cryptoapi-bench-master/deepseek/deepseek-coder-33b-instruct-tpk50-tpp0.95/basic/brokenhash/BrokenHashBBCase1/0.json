There are no misuses in the provided code snippet. This code will create a SHA1 hash of the string "abcdef". It's a simple usage of a hashing algorithm that is commonly used in Java. 

However, please be aware that printing `md.digest()` directly might not give meaningful results. You would normally convert the byte array to a hexadecimal or base64 encoded string before printing. 

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.Base64;

public class B1 {
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String name = "abcdef";
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA1");
        md.update(name.getBytes());
        byte[] digest = md.digest();
        String hash = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(digest);
        System.out.println(hash);
    }
}
```
In this corrected code, the digest is first encoded in base64 format (which is more commonly used in situations like this), and then the resulting string is printed.
