The given code is using the SHA-1 hash algorithm, which is considered vulnerable and insecure due to its collision resistance. You should use a stronger hash algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "SHA1 Use",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "SHA-1 has been widely criticized because of its weakness in collision resistance against well-funded opponents. The attacker can generate a new collision with much less computational effort than it would take the original message.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'SHA1' with 'SHA-256', 'SHA-3', or another stronger hash algorithm."
  }
]
```
