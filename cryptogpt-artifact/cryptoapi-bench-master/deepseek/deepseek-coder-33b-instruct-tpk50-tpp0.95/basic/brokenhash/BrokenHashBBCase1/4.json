  "description": "The code uses a hardcoded string, 'abcdef', as input for the cryptographic operation. This is not recommended as it makes the code more susceptible to dictionary attacks or brute force attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding the string, you should prompt the user for an input or use a variable that the user could provide at runtime."
