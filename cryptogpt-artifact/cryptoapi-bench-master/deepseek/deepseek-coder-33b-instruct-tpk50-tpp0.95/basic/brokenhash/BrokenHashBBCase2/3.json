        "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered to be insecure as it produces 128-bit (16-byte) hashes. MD5 has been demonstrated to be vulnerable to collision attacks (pre-image and second-preimage resistance). This means that it is possible to find two different inputs that have the same MD5 hash value. Hence, MD5 should not be used for any cryptographic operations where security is a concern.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm like SHA-256, which produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash. This hash value is significantly harder to guess, even with brute force, providing a more secure way of hashing passwords or other sensitive information."
