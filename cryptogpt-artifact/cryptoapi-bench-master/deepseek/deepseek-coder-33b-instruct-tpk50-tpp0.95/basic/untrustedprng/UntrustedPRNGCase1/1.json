        "description": "The java.util.Random class's 'nextInt()' method is not suitable for creating unpredictable or secure random numbers. The method uses a naive implementation which uses the current time as a seed for the random number generator, which can be predicted if an attacker is able to measure the time between the calls. This can lead to predictable random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as java.security.SecureRandom for generating secure random numbers."
