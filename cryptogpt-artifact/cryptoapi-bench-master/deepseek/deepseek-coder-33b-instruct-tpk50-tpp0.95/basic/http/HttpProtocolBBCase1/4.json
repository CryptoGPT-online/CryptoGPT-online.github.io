This code snippet is not performing any cryptographic or security-related misuses. It simply creates a URL object and prints it. If you are looking for potential misuses, I suggest looking for other code that could lead to potential security issues, such as:

- Insecure communication (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- Untrusted SSL certificates
- URL redirection
- URL parameters
- External inputs or files included in the URL
- Unverified data (e.g., user input, network data)

If you are checking for any specific cryptography misuse or vulnerabilities, please provide more context or a specific code snippet that you want me to review for vulnerabilities.
