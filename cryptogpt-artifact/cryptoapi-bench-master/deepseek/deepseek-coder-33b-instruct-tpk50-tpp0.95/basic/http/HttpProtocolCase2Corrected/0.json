Explanation: 

The given code snippet does not contain any crypto API misuse as per the given list of CWE codes. It only creates a URL object and prints it, which is a standard practice in Java. 

The `MalformedURLException` is handled properly in the `main` method. Moreover, the `url` string is hardcoded and not generated from user inputs, so it's unlikely that this code snippet would contain any insecure use of crypto API.

Please note that, if the `url` string is constructed using any user input or other external data, additional checks and validations would be necessary to avoid potential misuses.
