This code does not have any vulnerabilities related to cryptographic misuses. It's a simple Java program that creates a new URL object from a string. Here's the code:

```Java
import java.net.URL;

public class Hd {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String url = "https://www.google.com";
        System.out.println(new URL(url));
    }
}
```

It's a perfectly fine piece of code that doesn't use cryptographic features, even though the URL object can be used to make HTTP requests, which may involve cryptographic operations. So, the code is not at risk of any cryptographic misuse.
