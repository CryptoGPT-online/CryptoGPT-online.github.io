The code you provided is fine as it uses Blowfish for encryption but it does not use any encryption or decryption method call. If you want to use this code for encryption or decryption, you need to call the `doFinal` method.

Here is an example of how you could modify your code to perform encryption and decryption:

```java
public class B2 {
    public byte[] goEncrypt(String plaintext) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, UnsupportedEncodingException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("Blowfish");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("Blowfish");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);

        return cipher.doFinal(plaintext.getBytes("UTF-8"));
    }

    public String goDecrypt(byte[] ciphertext) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, UnsupportedEncodingException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("Blowfish");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("Blowfish");
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);

        byte[] decrypted = cipher.doFinal(ciphertext);
        return new String(decrypted, "UTF-8");
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, UnsupportedEncodingException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException {
        B2 bc = new B2();
        byte[] encrypted = bc.goEncrypt("plaintext");
        String decrypted = bc.goDecrypt(encrypted);
        System.out.println("Decrypted: " + decrypted);
    }
}
```

Please note that in the real-world code, you should never generate a new key every time you want to encrypt/decrypt, but you should reuse the same key. Also, "Blowfish" algorithm is no longer secure and considered as broken, so you should use more secure algorithms such as AES.
