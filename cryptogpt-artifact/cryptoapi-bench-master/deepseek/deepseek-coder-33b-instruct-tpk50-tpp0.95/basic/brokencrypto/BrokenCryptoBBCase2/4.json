        "description": "Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, now considered to be insecure. It's not approved for federal government use or for use in mission-critical applications. It uses a fixed block size of 64 bits and a variable key size from 32 to 448 bits.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using stronger encryption algorithms such as AES, RSA, or the Twofish algorithm instead of Blowfish. You can use a 256-bit key for AES and RSA."
