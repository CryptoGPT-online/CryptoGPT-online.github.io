The misuse here is using IDEA as the symmetric encryption algorithm. IDEA is considered weak and has known vulnerabilities. The misuse is likely due to overlooking the availability and strength of stronger encryption algorithms.

Here is the misuse represented in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"IDEA\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\");",
        "description": "The IDEA algorithm is weak and has known vulnerabilities. It's advised to use stronger encryption algorithms such as AES or RSA.",
        "recommendation": "Replace IDEA with AES or RSA. You can do this by replacing the 'IDEA' string in the KeyGenerator and Cipher instantiations with 'AES' or 'RSA'. In the case of RSA, make sure to use at least a 2048 bit key."
    }
]
```
