Misuse: 
The use of RC2 is not recommended for encryption due to it being vulnerable to attacks.

Vulnerable Code: 
```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("RC2");
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RC2");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
```

Description:
The RC2 cipher is a weak encryption algorithm that has been found vulnerable to attacks. While it has been superseded by more secure encryption algorithms, it is not recommended to use for new applications due to potential vulnerabilities.

Recommendation: 
It is recommended to replace the use of RC2 and other weak encryption algorithms with a more secure one such as AES. To provide a more secure key, use key sizes of at least 128 bits for AES. Additionally, consider using secure random number generators to generate keys.
