Misuse: RC4 is a weak cryptographic algorithm
Vulnerable_code: 
```
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("RC4");
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RC4");
```
Description: The RC4 algorithm is a stream cipher and has numerous design weaknesses. It is believed to be cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.
Recommendation: Use a secure encryption algorithm like AES instead of RC4.
