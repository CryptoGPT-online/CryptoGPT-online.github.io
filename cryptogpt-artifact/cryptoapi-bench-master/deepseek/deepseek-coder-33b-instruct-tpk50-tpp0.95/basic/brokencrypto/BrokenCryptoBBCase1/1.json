The provided Java code is using a weak cryptographic algorithm (DES) for encryption, which is not secure. Additionally, the key is generated directly, which is not recommended in production environments. This code will be susceptible to several misuses, including:

- Weak Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-326): The DES algorithm is considered to be weak. It can be easily broken even with modern computational power. In production environments, more secure algorithms like AES should be used.
- Inadequate Key Length (CWE-256): While DES provides more than 50 bits of security, it is vulnerable to exhaustive key search, brute force, and birthday attack. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 128 bits or more.
- Generation of Cryptographic Key (CWE-295): In the provided code, the key is generated with `KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES")`. In a real-world scenario, a cryptographic key should be randomly generated, preferably using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
- Hard-Coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321): A cryptographic key should not be hard-coded into a program. If a key is hard-coded, it can be easily discovered by an attacker.
- Mode of Operation: The code is using Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode for encryption. This mode has the disadvantage of providing no confidentiality if two blocks of plaintext are identical. An attacker could use statistical analysis to determine the plaintext if the same plaintext block occurs multiple times in the ciphertext. In production environments, a more secure mode of operation like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) should be used.
- IV (Initialization Vector) is not used: If the mode of operation is CBC, the IV is necessary and should be securely generated.

Here's how to fix these issues:

```java
import javax.crypto.*;
import java.security.*;

public class B1 {
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(128); // specify key size
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"); // use CBC mode
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(new SecureRandom().generateSeed(16))); // use secure random number for IV
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B1 bc = new B1();
        bc.go();
    }
}
```

In this modified code, AES is used as the cryptographic algorithm, as AES provides much higher security than DES. A secure random number generator is used to generate the key, ensuring it's hard to predict. The mode of operation is also changed to CBC from ECB, which provides better security. Lastly, a random initialization vector is used, which also adds to the overall security of the encryption process.
