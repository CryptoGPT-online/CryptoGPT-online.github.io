    "description": "The PBE iteration count is set to 1020 which is less than the recommended count of 100,000. This makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks, which could be used to break the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a higher count value, such as 100,000 or higher, to make the encryption stronger."
