        "description": "The code is using a statically defined crypto algorithm, which is a major misuse. The algorithm is a field of the class B6, which may be manipulated at runtime. This allows an attacker to modify the crypto algorithm at runtime, potentially allowing them to use a less secure algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using a static field for the crypto algorithm, consider using a parameter or a method to allow it to be determined at runtime."
