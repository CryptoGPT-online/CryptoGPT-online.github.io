    "description": "The code is using the SHA1 algorithm which is considered a weak and insecure cryptographic hash function. The risk associated with using such weak hashing functions is that they might be susceptible to brute-force attacks and/or hash collisions.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the usage of weak cryptographic hash functions with stronger alternatives, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. Alternatively, if you need a hash that is shorter for performance reasons, consider using a non-cryptographic hash like the FNV, CityHash, or MurmurHash instead."
