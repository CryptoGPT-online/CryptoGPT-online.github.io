    "description": "The code uses the string representation of crypto, which is the character array 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO'. 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO' is a static string, which could be manipulated, making it vulnerable to attack. The toCharArray() method is not invoked, so the characters are not preserved and instead the object reference is used.",
    "recommendation": "Use a string for the cryptographic hash function name (instead of a character array). Only use the character array if you need the individual characters. Always validate and sanitize all inputs, especially from an untrusted source."
