    "misuse": "MD2 cryptographic hash algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The MD2 hash algorithm is considered insecure and should not be used for any cryptographic operations. It was designed in the 90s and has known vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to collision attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger hash algorithm such as SHA-256. If the data needs to be hashed only to be stored, consider a modern password hashing function like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2."
