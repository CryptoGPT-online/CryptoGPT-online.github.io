        "description": "The provided code seeds the SecureRandom object with a single byte. This is an extremely insecure way to initialize a SecureRandom object. It does not generate a random seed as a sequence of bytes as needed. This can make the generated random numbers predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a method that guarantees a secure seed for SecureRandom such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(). If that is not possible, use a secure random seed generator to generate a suitable seed. Alternatively, if possible, switch to use a Random object for less secure random numbers."
