        "description": "The code uses SecureRandom with a known seed. A seed is used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator, which means that the pseudorandom number generator will always generate the same sequence of numbers if it is initialized with the same seed. This is not considered secure and should not be used for anything other than testing or other non-security related purposes.",
        "recommendation": "If you need a seeded random number generator for testing, consider using a non-cryptographic PRNG (like java.util.Random). If you need a seeded random number generator for something related to security, consider using a cryptographic PRNG (like java.security.SecureRandom) and make sure the seed cannot be guessed or found in any other way."
