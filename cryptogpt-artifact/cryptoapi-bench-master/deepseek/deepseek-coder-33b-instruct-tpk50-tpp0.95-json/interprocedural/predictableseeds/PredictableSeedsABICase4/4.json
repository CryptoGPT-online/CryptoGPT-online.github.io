        "description": "The code is using a byte array to seed a SecureRandom object. This can lead to insecure randomness, as the byte array is only 1 byte long, leading to a limited possible seed values. This can make the random numbers predictable.",
        "recommendation": "You should remove the byte array seeding from the SecureRandom constructor and leave it to automatically seed by the system, or provide a better seed if necessary."
