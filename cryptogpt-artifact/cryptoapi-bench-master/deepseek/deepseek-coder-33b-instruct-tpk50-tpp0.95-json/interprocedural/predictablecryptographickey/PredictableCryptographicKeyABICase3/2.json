    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
    "description": "The hard-coded encryption key can potentially be insecure and may be a source of serious security issues. In this case, the key is hardcoded and not changing for different use cases, which makes it easy for attackers to guess or brute-force the key if they have access to the code. This makes the encryption scheme completely ineffective.",
    "recommendation": "To mitigate this vulnerability, the encryption key should be randomly generated and never hard-coded. It should also be kept secure and not easily accessible. A safe way to generate a strong, random encryption key in Java can be achieved by using the SecureRandom class."
