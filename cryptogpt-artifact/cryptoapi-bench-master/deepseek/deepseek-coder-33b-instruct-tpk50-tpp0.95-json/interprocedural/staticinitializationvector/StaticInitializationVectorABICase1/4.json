    "description": "Using a static, hard-coded IV in AES/CBC is considered a severe misuse because it allows attackers to perform a chosen-plaintext attack. In such an attack, an attacker can encrypt a chosen plaintext and observe the resulting ciphertext. If the same plaintext is encrypted again, the ciphertexts will be identical, revealing the IV.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a new, random IV for each encryption operation. You can do this by calling the SecureRandom class to generate a secure random IV each time."
