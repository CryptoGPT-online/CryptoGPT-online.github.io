    "description": "A fixed initialization vector (IV) can be used in CBC mode, which can potentially lead to patterns in the ciphertext and make it easier to break the encryption if the same message is encrypted multiple times. In ECB mode, the same message encrypts to the same text if the IV is fixed.",
    "recommendation": "Always use a different random IV for each encryption. Do not use the same IV for encrypting the same message multiple times."
