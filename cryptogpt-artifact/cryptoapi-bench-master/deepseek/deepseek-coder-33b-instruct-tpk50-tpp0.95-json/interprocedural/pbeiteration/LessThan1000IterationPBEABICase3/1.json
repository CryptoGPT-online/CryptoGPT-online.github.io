  "description": "The salt used in the PBEParameterSpec object is created locally in the method and then thrown away after the PBEParameterSpec object is created. This means that each time method1 is called, a new salt is created, but that salt is never used after method1 exits. This could potentially reduce the security provided by the salt, as the same salt is used each time.",
  "recommendation": "Store the salt in a field variable, instead of creating a new one each time method1 is called. Then use that field variable as the salt when creating the PBEParameterSpec object."
