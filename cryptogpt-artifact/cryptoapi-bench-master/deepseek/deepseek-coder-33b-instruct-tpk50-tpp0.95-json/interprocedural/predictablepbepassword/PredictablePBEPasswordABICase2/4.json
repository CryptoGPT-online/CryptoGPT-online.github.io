    "description": "The code is using the PBEKeySpec with an iteration count of 10000 for key derivation, which is considered insecure as it could lead to brute force attacks. The iteration count should ideally be around 10,000,000 (10 million) or more.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a higher iteration count. For example, 10,000,000 or more, to make it computationally expensive to brute force the key."
