    "recommendation": "Recommendation is to use a secure value based on the current security standards. The use of OWASP recommendations (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2) is a good starting point."

    "description": "Generating a secure random salt is very important for cryptographic purposes. Using a predictable random number generator can lead to vulnerabilities such as the same salt being used for multiple passwords and easier brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using java.util.Random as it uses an unsafe seed value. Instead, use java.security.SecureRandom, which uses a random seed value from a pool maintained by the JVM and is more difficult to predict."
