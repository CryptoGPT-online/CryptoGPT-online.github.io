It might be used in an application where secrecy of the generated value (like a secret key) is crucial.",
        "recommendation": "The seed for SecureRandom should be unpredictable. You can use current time in milliseconds as a seed. In a distributed system, ensure that a high-quality unique seed is used for each run. "
