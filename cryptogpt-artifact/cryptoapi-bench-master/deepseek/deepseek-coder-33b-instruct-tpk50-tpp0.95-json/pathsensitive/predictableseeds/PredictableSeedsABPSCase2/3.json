        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
        "description": "This code is using the same seed for SecureRandom every time, which makes the random number generator predictable. The same seed will always produce the same random number sequence.",
        "recommendation": "The seed value should be different each time the application is run to ensure a new random number sequence. This can be achieved by using SecureRandom's default constructor, which seeds the random number generator from the current time, in milliseconds."
