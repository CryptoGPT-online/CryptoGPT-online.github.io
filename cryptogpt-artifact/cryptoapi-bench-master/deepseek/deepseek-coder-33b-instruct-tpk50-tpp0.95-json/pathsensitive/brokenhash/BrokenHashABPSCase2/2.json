    "description": "In this code, the algorithm to be used for hashing is controlled by the value of the variable `choice`. This could potentially allow an attacker to choose a less secure algorithm, such as MD5 or SHA-1.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of allowing the algorithm to be controlled by user input, the algorithm should be hardcoded. It is also recommended to use stronger hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or higher, as MD5 and SHA-1 are now considered cryptographically broken."
