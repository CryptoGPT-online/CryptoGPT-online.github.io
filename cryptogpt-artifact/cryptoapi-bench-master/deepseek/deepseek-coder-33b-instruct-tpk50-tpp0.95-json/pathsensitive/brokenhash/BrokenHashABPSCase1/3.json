    "description": "The code is using a weak cryptographic algorithm, SHA1, which is not considered to be secure. In addition, the algorithm is dynamically chosen based on a user input variable. The risk is that an attacker might be able to choose an insecure algorithm and get access to the data.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid dynamically choosing the algorithm. Use a hardcoded secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
