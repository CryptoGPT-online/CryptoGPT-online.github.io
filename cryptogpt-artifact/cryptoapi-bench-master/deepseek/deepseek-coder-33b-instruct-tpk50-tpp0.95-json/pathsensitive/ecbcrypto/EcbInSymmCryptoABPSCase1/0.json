        "description": "The code uses a KeyGenerator instance to generate AES keys. The default behavior of KeyGenerator is to generate keys using a non-secure random number generator. This can make keys predictable and vulnerable to attack.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this, you can specify a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom. You can create a KeyGenerator instance that uses a secure random number generator, like so: `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", \"BC\");` where \"BC\" is the Bouncy Castle provider."
