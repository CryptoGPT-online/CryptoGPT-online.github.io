    "description": "The MessageDigest.getInstance() method creates a new MessageDigest object for the specified crypto provider. In this case, it's creating an MD2 message digest, which is not the intended use case. MD2 is not a message digest algorithm, it's a hash function, which is not used for encryption or decryption. It's generally recommended to use a hash function for storing passwords rather than encrypting them.",
    "recommendation": "For encryption and decryption tasks, use a block cipher algorithm like AES. For hashing tasks, use a hash function like SHA-256."
