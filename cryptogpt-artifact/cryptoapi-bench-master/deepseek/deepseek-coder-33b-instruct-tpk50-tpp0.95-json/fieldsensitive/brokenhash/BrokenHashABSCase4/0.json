        "description": "MD2 is a weak hash function that is considered no longer secure for most applications. It's vulnerable to length-extension attacks, which can allow an attacker to generate a new hash value for a given input, knowing the hash value for a longer string. This can be very dangerous as it can lead to data integrity issues.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using stronger hash algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-3, or bcrypt. However, be aware that if you're really using this for password hashing, bcrypt is still preferable as it's designed to be slow and the slowness can be a defense against brute-force attacks."
