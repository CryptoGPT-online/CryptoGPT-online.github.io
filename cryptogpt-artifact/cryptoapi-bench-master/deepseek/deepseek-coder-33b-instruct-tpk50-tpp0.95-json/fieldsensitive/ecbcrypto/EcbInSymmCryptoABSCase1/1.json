        "description": "The program uses Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode for encryption. CBC has a number of problems related to the security of encryption, such as the ability to reveal patterns and can be susceptible to padding oracle attacks. If the initial value is not randomized, or is reused, it can result in data leakage or insecurity.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a mode such as Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, which is simple to understand and implement. If data integrity is paramount, consider using Cipher FeedBack (CFB) or Output FeedBack (OFB) modes, or the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for Ciphers that support this mode."
