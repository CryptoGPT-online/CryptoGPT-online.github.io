    "description": "The use of low iteration count (20 in this case) can be insecure because it makes PBE weaker. Low iteration counts make PBKDF2 brute-forceable and reduces the time needed to crack the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "The iteration count should be as high as your resources can handle. Considering the time available for brute-force attacks, consider adding a random delay after the specified iteration count to mitigate the risk."
