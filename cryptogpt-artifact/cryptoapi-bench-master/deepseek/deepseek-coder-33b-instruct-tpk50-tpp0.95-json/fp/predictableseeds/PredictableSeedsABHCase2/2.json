    "description": "The use of a byte array as the seed for SecureRandom is not recommended, as this can lead to predictable outcomes if the byte array is known. In the given code, the byte array {b,b} is used, which has a predictable value (b * 256 + b), and this value will be used to seed the SecureRandom object. If an attacker knows this seed, they may be able to predict the output of the SecureRandom.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using a byte array as a seed for SecureRandom. Instead, use a fixed seed, such as System.nanoTime() or a cryptographically secure random number generated with java.security.SecureRandom. If a seed is needed, use a proper cryptographic secure random number generation."
