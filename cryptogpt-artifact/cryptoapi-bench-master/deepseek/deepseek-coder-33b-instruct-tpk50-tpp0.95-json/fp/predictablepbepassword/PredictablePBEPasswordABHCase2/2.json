    "description": "The keys \"aaa\", \"bbb\", \"ccc\", and \"ddd\" are hard-coded into the program. This can be a security risk, as these keys may be reused across the software and are difficult to change if they were to be compromised. It is also not secure to include such sensitive information within the source code.",
    "recommendation": "Any keys or credentials used within the code should not be hard-coded into the source code. Instead, these should be stored in a secure configuration file that is not accessible to the code repository, or should be securely stored in an encrypted database. Furthermore, these keys should not be the same across different systems or instances of the same software."

    "description": "The iterationCount value is relatively low. This can reduce the security provided by the encryption, which could allow for attacks to successfully brute-force the encryption key.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iterationCount value to a minimum of 100,000. This will increase the computation time required for the algorithm and make it more secure against brute-force attacks."

    "recommendation": "Generate and store a unique salt for each user in a secure manner. This could be stored in a user profile or a secure database, and should be randomly generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator."
