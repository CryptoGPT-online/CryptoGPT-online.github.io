"misuse": "Hardcoded Iteration Count and Key Length",
"vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;\nint keyLength = 16;",
"description": "The iteration count is large and key length is relatively small, which might lead to inefficient encryption and make it vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "It is recommended to choose a balance between security and performance. For instance, you might consider using a higher key length (256 bits or more) and consider increasing the iteration count, but be aware that it will also affect the processing time."
