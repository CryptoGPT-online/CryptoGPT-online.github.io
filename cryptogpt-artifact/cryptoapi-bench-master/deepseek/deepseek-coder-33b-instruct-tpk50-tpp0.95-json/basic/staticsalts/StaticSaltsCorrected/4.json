However, PBEParameterSpec does not have an effective way to provide the salt. The iteration count can be set to a value of 1024 or higher. The PBE iteration count is the most important parameter for password-based encryption. By default, JCE suggests 10,000 as a good start. The use of a lower number could result in less secure encryption. Therefore, the provided count of 1020 is not advised.",        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (SecureRandom) to generate the salt and a high iteration count (10,000 or higher) for PBEParameterSpec."    }]
