        "description": "This code does not perform any server certificate validation. This can be a security risk as it allows for man-in-the-middle attacks. A trusted CA root certificate is not checked in this case.",
        "recommendation": "Use proper certificate validation process. Make sure server certificates are issued and signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Also, verify the CN (Common Name) field matches the domain name. Use certificate pinning to ensure the server certificate is exactly the one you expect."
