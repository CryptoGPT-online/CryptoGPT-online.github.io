Its key size is too small (128 bits) and it's not recommended for any serious cryptography applications. Its 12 rounds of encryption is considered too small for modern day computers to break within a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm is also vulnerable to differential and linear cryptanalysis.",        "recommendation": "Consider using stronger ciphers such as AES which is widely regarded as secure."    }]
