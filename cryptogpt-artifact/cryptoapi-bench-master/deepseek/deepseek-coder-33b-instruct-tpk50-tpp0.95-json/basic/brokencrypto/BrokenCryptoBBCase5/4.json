  "description": "The IDEA encryption algorithm is deprecated and the size of the encryption key is weak (128 bits). This can lead to vulnerabilities and is generally considered insecure.",
  "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure encryption algorithm like AES (AES-256) instead of IDEA. This will require changing the cipher instance to AES also, but that's a simple find and replace operation."
