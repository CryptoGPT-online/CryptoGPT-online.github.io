    "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
    "vulnerable_code": "if (\"192.168.0.10\".equals(hostname)) {...}",
    "description": "The code hardcodes the expected hostname to be '192.168.0.10', but this is likely incorrect. This could cause connections to the wrong host, opening up potential security risks.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding the hostname and instead validate the certificate based on the actual hostname."
}]
```

This warning means that the hostname should not be hardcoded into the code. Instead, the hostname should be obtained from user input or other sources, and should be validated based on the actual certificate that is presented during the SSL handshake. This can help prevent potential security issues caused by connecting to the wrong host.
