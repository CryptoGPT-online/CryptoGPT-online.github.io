        "description": "The verify method of the HostnameVerifier interface is used to verify the hostname in the server's SSL certificate. Returning true allows all hostnames, this could potentially allow an attacker to impersonate any server. This is insecure because it can lead to a Man-in-the-Middle attack.",
        "recommendation": "Always use a secure implementation of the HostnameVerifier interface. For example, you can use the default HostnameVerifier which checks if the hostname matches the hostname in the server's certificate."
