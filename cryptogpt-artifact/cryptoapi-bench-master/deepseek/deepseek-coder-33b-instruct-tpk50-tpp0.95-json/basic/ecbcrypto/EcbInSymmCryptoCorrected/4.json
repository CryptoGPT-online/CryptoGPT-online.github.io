        "description": "CBC is generally the better choice than ECB. While ECB is simple and doesn't need an IV (Initialization Vector), it lacks the security from its name (which suggests that identical plaintexts are encrypted into identical ciphertexts). This might allow an attacker to detect that two or more original blocks have been encrypted into the same ciphertext block and therefore might be able to decipher those blocks.",
        "recommendation": "Change the mode to CBC or ensure that the mode is ECB."
