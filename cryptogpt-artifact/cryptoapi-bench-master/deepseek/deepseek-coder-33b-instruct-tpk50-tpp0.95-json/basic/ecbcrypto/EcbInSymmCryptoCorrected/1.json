        "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) is a mode of operation in block ciphers. It encrypts the plain text block by block, and there is no confusion with any other blocks in the encryption process, hence the name, Electronic Codebook. ECB mode does not provide any kind of robustness or security. This is because if the same plain text block is encrypted multiple times, the resulting cipher text is also same each time. This can lead to many vulnerabilities, one of the main being to reveal patterns when plain text is known.",
        "recommendation": "Always use Cipher with a secure mode of operation like CBC, CFB, OFB, or CTR. If GCM mode is available, it is the recommended mode of operation for most use-cases. ECB mode should not be used without a strong justification and not as a default."
