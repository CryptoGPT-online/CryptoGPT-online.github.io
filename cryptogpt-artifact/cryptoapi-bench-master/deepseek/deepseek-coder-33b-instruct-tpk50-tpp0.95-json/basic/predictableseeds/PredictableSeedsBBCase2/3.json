        "description": "The seed used in the SecureRandom constructor is a single byte, which means that the range of possible seeds is very limited. This can lead to the same seed producing the same sequence of random numbers, which could lead to insecure behavior.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a larger seed for the SecureRandom constructor. If possible, use a byte array that is larger than 1 byte. Longer seeds are generally more secure."
