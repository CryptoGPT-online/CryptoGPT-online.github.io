        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
        "description": "The provided code uses a hardcoded key that is too short. The 'getBytes' method converts the key to bytes, and then 'Arrays.copyOf' is used to make the key 16 bytes long, effectively extending it. AES requires a 128-bit key, which is 16 bytes long, therefore this key is too short.",
        "recommendation": "You should use a 16-byte long key (or at least a 128-bit key) to meet the requirement of AES. If you're using a password, you should use a password-based key derivation function such as PBKDF2 to generate a secure key from the password."
