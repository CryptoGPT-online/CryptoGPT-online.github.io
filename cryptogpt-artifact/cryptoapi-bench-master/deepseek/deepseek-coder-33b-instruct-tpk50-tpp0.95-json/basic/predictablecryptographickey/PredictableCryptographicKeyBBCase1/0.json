    "description": "The key is only 16 bytes long and it's created from a short string \"defaultkey\", which is easily guessable. This may make the encryption weak and the data easily vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a longer, randomly generated key for encryption. Using a key management system can also be a good option for securely storing keys."
