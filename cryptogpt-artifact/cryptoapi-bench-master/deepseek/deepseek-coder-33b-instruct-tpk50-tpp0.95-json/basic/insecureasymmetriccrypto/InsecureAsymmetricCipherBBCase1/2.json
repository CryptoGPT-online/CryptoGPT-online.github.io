    "description": "The code is using the RSA algorithm for encryption and decryption. RSA is considered insecure due to vulnerabilities to attacks such as brute force and timing attacks. The algorithm is typically recommended for use in non-sensitive scenarios such as key exchange, digital signatures, and padding.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES for symmetric encryption or ECC/EdDSA for asymmetric encryption."

    "description": "The SealedObject class is used to securely store an object in an encrypted form. However, in this code, the object is simply a string without any specific security measures. If this string contains sensitive data, it should be encrypted before storing in a SealedObject.",
    "recommendation": "Always encrypt sensitive data before storing in a SealedObject. You can use AES encryption for this purpose."
