The code you provided has a few insecure implementations and misuses of the cryptography API.

1. The key length used is not specified:

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
```
The AES key size can be 128, 192, or 256 bits, but this is not specified in the code. It is recommended to use a 256-bit key size for maximum security.

2. The IV is generated from a short string:

```java
byte [] bytes = "abcde".getBytes("UTF-8");
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);
```
The IV (initialization vector) should be randomly generated for each encryption, and should be at least 128 bits long for AES-CBC mode.

3. The Key is generated each time:

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
```
The key should not be generated each time. It should be stored securely, preferably in a secure key store, and loaded each time it is needed for encryption or decryption.

4. The Cipher instance is initialized:

```java
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec);
```
This does not specify a secure random number generator for the key generation and initialization. By default, the cryptography API uses a non-secure random number generator. It is recommended to use `SecureRandom` for key and initialization vector generation.
