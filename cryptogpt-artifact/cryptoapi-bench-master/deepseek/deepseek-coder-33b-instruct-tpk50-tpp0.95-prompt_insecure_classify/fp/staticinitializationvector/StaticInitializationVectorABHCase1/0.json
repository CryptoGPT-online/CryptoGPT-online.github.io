The provided code is using AES for encryption, and IV (Initialization Vector) is set to a static value. This is insecure because it can lead to easily predictable and predictable ciphertexts, which can lead to information disclosure or even a potential for attacks. The IV should be a random value and it is different for each encryption operation.

In the provided code, IV is set to "abcde".getBytes("UTF-8"), which is a non-random value.

The following is the JSON response with the identified misuse:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n\nIvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
    "description": "The IV value is set to a non-random value. It should be generated using a cryptographically strong random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom class to generate a random IV for each encryption operation."
}]
```
