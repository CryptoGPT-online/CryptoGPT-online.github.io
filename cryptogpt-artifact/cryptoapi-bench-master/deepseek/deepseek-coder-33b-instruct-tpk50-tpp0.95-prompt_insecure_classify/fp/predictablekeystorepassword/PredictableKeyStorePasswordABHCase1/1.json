The code you've provided contains a misuse of cryptographic API:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
        "description": "The password is generated from the integer sequence produced by SecureRandom. This can be predicted and doesn't provide a sufficient level of entropy, making it easier to guess or brute-force.",
        "recommendation": "To address this issue, a password should be randomly generated using a source of genuinely random numbers. If a secure password is needed (i.e. for encryption keys), a password should be a randomly generated sequence of characters, a passphrase should be randomly generated, and this passphrase should be turned into a secure key using a key derivation function (KDF)."
