Based on the code provided, I found the following misuses:

1. The use of a predictable password for the keystore. Passwords should be random and complex to make it harder for an attacker to guess.
2. The password used for the keystore is generated as a string of random integers. This is highly insecure as it can be easily guessed by an attacker.

Here's how the code can be fixed:

```java
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.KeyStore;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class P1 {
    URL cacerts;
    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
        P1 p1 = new P1();
        p1.go();
    }

    public void go() throws Exception {
        String type = "JKS";
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] keyBytes = new byte[16]; //128 bit key length
        random.nextBytes(keyBytes);

        KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);
        cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com");
        ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), keyBytes);
    }
}
```

The misuses have been addressed in the updated code. The random password is now a byte array of length 16 (128 bits) instead of a string of random integers. The password is now generated using a secure random number generator (SecureRandom) instead of creating a string from the random integers. 

However, please note that this code doesn't take care of properly encoding the bytes to a valid password. If you want to convert the byte array to a valid password string, you should use a secure encoding method. This will depend on your specific requirements and the security policy of your application.
