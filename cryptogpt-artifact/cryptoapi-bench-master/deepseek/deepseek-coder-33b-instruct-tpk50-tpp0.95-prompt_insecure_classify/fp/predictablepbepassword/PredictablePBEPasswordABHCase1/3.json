Based on the provided code, it appears that there might be an issue with the usage of PBEKeySpec. The iteration count is set to a high value, which can lead to high CPU usage during key derivation. This could potentially lead to a denial of service attack if this code is used on a system without the resources to handle such high computation.

Here is the recommendation:
- You could set a limit on the iteration count based on the security requirements. It is recommended to keep the iteration count low (e.g. less than 10000) to avoid DoS attacks.

The JSON response would be:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to a high value, which can lead to high CPU usage during key derivation.",
        "recommendation": "You could set a limit on the iteration count based on the security requirements. It is recommended to keep the iteration count low (e.g. less than 10000) to avoid DoS attacks."
    }
