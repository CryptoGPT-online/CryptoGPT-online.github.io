The code provided is utilizing the PBEKeySpec and PBEParameterSpec classes from the javax.crypto package, which are used in Password-Based Encryption. However, it contains several security misuses:

1. Use of Insecure Random number generation.
   The SecureRandom class is used to generate a secure random salt. However, the random.ints() method is used to generate the defaultKey, which could lead to predictable key generation, increasing the risk of attacks. 

2. Use of Low Iteration Count.
   In this case, the iteration count is set to 11010, which is relatively low. This can expose the encryption to attacks where the attacker can try a large number of possible key candidates. 

3. Use of Low Key/Salt Length.
   In this case, the key length is set to 16 bytes, which is relatively small. Weak keys can expose sensitive data to attacks. Similar issues exist for the salt length.
