The code provided is indeed vulnerable to several misuses of the cryptography API. 

1. The PBEKeySpec object is being created with a iteration count of 11010. This is quite high, which could result in slower performance or even a possible DOS attack. It's recommended to use a value that is balanced between security and performance.

2. The same goes for the key length which is set to 16. Although AES is generally known for its robustness, you should use a higher key length for better security.

3. The key bytes are being converted to a string before being used. This could introduce an encoding issue if the byte array contains unexpected values that do not map to valid characters in the current encoding. It is recommended to work directly with byte arrays instead.

4. The SecureRandom is not being seeded when generating the key and salt. If the SecureRandom is not seeded, it can be susceptible to certain attacks (e.g. statistical analysis attacks), which can potentially weaken the randomness of the generated bytes.
