The code provided has the following crypto API misuses:

1) CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

Misuse Code: 
```java
int iterationCount = 11010;
```

Description: 
This code is using a high number for the iteration count which is insecure as it can result in a computationally expensive and thus hard to crack the key.

Recommendation:
The PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) should have a minimum iteration count of 10,000 and 310,000 for sensitive applications.

```java
int iterationCount = 310000; // Increase the number for sensitive applications.
```

2) CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

Misuse Code:
```java
byte [] salt = new byte[16];
```

Description:
Salt values should be random and generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG). In this case, an all-zero salt value is used.

Recommendation:
Replace the salt generation with a secure random salt generation.

```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
byte [] salt = new byte[16];
sr.nextBytes(salt);
```

3) CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation

Misuse Code:
```java
String.valueOf(random.ints());
```

Description: 
The code is casting the result of random.ints() (which generates a stream of random integers) to a String and then obtaining the bytes of this string. Although, not directly related to the issue, it is worth noting that `random.ints()` can generate integers in an unpredictable way, it might not generate a secure random key.

Recommendation:
Instead of using random.ints(), a more secure method should be used to generate a random byte array.

```java
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
byte [] keyBytes = new byte[16]; // Adjust the length as needed.
random.nextBytes(keyBytes);
```
