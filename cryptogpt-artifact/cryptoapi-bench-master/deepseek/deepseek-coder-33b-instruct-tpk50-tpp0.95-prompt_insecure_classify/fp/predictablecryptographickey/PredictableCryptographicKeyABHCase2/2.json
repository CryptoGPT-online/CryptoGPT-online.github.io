The provided code does not directly contain a crypto API misuse, but it is an example of low-level crypto code. 

The main misuse in this code is the hardcoding of the AES algorithm key, which can be a significant security risk, especially when dealing with sensitive data. The AES algorithm should not be used with hardcoded keys.

The issue is also that the example is using the old CBC mode for AES, which is insecure. Other issues include not having a IV for CBC mode and using ECB mode for encryption, which is not secure against common attacks.

The code could be replaced with the following more secure version:

```java
public class P2 {
    public static void main(String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {

        Map<String,String> hm = new HashMap<String, String>();
        hm.put("aaa", "afix");
        hm.put("bbb", "bfix");
        hm.put("ccc", "cfix");
        hm.put("ddd", "dfix");

        String key = hm.get("aaa");
        byte[] iv = new byte[16];
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        random.nextBytes(iv);
        IvParameterSpec ivParameterSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);

        SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
        KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(key.toCharArray(), iv, 65536, 256);
        SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);
        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), "AES");

        // then you can use this secretKey with AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
    }
}
```
In this example, the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 is a stronger algorithm to derive keys from passwords, and then this key is used with AES in CBC mode with a random IV. This is a more secure way to use cryptographic APIs.
