The provided code contains a misuse of cryptographic API, which is the use of an insecure key size for the AES algorithm. The AES algorithm requires a key size of either 128, 192 or 256 bits. The key size used in the provided code is 16 bytes, which is a bit too small and can be a cause for security vulnerabilities.

Here is the misuse in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
        "description": "The key size is too small for the AES encryption algorithm. The key size should be at least 128 bits.",
        "recommendation": "Use a key size that is at least 128 bits for the AES algorithm. You can generate a secure random key with a larger size and then truncate it to 128 bits."
    }
]
```
