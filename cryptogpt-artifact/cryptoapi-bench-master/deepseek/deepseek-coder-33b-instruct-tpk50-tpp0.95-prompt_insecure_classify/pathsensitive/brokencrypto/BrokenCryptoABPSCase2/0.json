The code snippet provided has a cryptographic misuse. The cryptographic algorithm chosen is not the strongest or recommended algorithm. The choice of the cipher based on a condition may leave the code vulnerable to a chosen ciphertext attack. Also, the AES keys are being generated without specifying the key size, which is not secure and might lead to the use of a weak key size.

        "description": "The use of the Blowfish algorithm is risky and should not be used in modern cryptography. It is considered weak and may not be secure.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm like AES or RSA. Blowfish has been broken since 2001 and is not considered secure anymore."
