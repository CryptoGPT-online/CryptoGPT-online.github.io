This code contains the following security misuses:

1. The AES key generation and Blowfish encryption are done without specifying the key size. AES is commonly used with a key size of 256 bits and Blowfish is typically used with a key size of 128 bits. If the key size is not specified, it defaults to 128 bits which is considered weak for AES.

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("Blowfish");
```

2. The key generated is not stored anywhere securely, which makes it insecure. If the key is leaked, the encrypted data can be decrypted.

3. The Blowfish algorithm is a less secure and slower encryption algorithm compared to AES. It is therefore not recommended for use in new or modern applications.
