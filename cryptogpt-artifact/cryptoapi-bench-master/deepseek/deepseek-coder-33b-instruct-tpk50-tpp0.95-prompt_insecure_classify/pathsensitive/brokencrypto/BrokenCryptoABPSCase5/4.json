The misuse here is the use of weak cryptographic algorithm. The IDEA is not considered a secure algorithm anymore and there are more secure algorithms like AES in the code.

The misuse code snippets:

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("IDEA");
```

Description: 
In the given code snippet, the IDEA algorithm is used as the cipher. IDEA is a weak algorithm and has been broken by several cryptanalysis attacks. It is vulnerable to attacks such as differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis.

Recommendation:
Use a secure cipher such as AES, RSA or ECC, which are considered strong and should be used over the weak IDEA algorithm.
