Here are the cryptographic API misuses in the provided code:

1. The use of IDEA Cipher algorithm in `Cipher.getInstance("IDEA")` is considered risky. IDEA has been broken and its security has been completely compromised. You should use AES instead.

The JSON response for this misuse is as follows:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\")",
    "description": "The IDEA algorithm has been broken and its security has been completely compromised. Instead of IDEA, you should use AES.",
    "recommendation": "Replace IDEA with AES or any other secure cipher algorithm."
}]
```
