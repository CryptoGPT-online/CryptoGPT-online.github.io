The code above is vulnerable to the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm due to a weak random number generator. The `KeyGenerator` class is used to generate a secret key for the AES cipher, but the key generated by this class is not sufficiently random. This can lead to the compromise of the encrypted data. The RC4 cipher algorithm is also considered risky for its weak key generation and can potentially lead to the same issue. 

AES cipher with a key of length 128 is considered secure but if not properly used it can still open to attacks. It is generally recommended to use a key length of 256 bits or higher.

Also, it's not always guaranteed that the key generated by `KeyGenerator` is really random. It depends on the implementation of the `KeyGenerator` class and its underlying random number generator.

Here is the classification:
