CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:
Misuse Code: Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RC4");

Description: RC4 is a weak encryption algorithm and it's no longer considered secure for most applications. We recommend using stronger ciphers like AES.

Recommendation: Replace "RC4" with "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" or some other secure cipher.
