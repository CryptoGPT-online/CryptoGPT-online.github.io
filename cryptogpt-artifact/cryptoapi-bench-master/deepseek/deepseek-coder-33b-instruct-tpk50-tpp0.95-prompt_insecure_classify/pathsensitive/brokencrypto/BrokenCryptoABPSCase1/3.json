The code is using the "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding" cipher algorithm, not the cipher mode that was chosen by the `choice` variable. The cipher mode used is always "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" no matter what the value of the `choice` variable is. 

Here is the vulnerable code:

```java
cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
```

To fix this, you should change the `choice` variable to decide which cipher to use:

```java
if (choice > 1)
    cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
else
    cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
```

Please note that Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with a null IV is insecure and should not be used in the real world. It is highly recommended to generate a secure, random IV and use it with the cipher. If an IV is not required (e.g. ECB mode), then no IV should be set.

So your final code would look something like this:

```java
public class B1 {
    public void go(int choice) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = null;
        if (choice > 1)
            cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        else
            cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B1 bc = new B1();
        int choice=2;
        bc.go(choice);
    }
}
```
