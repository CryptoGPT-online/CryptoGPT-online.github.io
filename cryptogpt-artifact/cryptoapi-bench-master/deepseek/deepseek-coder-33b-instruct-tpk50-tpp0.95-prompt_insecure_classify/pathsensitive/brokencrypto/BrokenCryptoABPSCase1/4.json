There are multiple misuses in the given code. Here are the details:

1. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
   Misuse: The choice of the encryption algorithm depends on a variable parameter (`choice`). It doesn't seem to be checked in any security-sensitive context, which could lead to the use of a less secure algorithm than initially intended.
   
   Vulnerable code:
   ```
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
    if (choice > 1)
        cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
   ```
   Description: In this code, the encryption algorithm used depends on the value of `choice`. If `choice` is greater than 1, "AES" is used. Otherwise, "DES" is used. This could lead to a less secure algorithm being used than originally intended.
   
   Recommendation: To fix this, you should validate `choice` to ensure it aligns with your intended use of encryption algorithms.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   Misuse: The generated AES key is not checked to ensure it is sufficiently secure.
   
   Vulnerable code:
   ```
    KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
    SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
   ```
   Description: This code generates an AES key, but it doesn't check the strength of the key before using it. The strength of the key is dependent on the specific implementation of the Java runtime environment.
   
   Recommendation: To fix this, you should check the strength of the AES key before using it. The strength can be checked using the `getEncoded().length` method. For example, if you are using a 256-bit AES key, then the encoded key length should be 32 bytes.
