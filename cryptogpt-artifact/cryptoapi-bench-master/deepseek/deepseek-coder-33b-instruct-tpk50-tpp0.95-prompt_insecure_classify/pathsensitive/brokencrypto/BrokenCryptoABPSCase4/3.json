The code is vulnerable to:

1. Using RC2, which is a weak algorithm. RC2 is considered insecure because of its short key length and potentially poor resistance to different types of crypto attacks.

2. Choosing cipher on the runtime based on choice variable, which might make it harder for someone to spot the issue.
