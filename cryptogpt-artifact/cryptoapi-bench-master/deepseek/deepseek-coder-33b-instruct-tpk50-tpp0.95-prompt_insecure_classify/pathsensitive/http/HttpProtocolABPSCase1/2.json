The code does not contain any CWE-related security issues. However, here are a few considerations:

1. The URL is hardcoded in the code. This might lead to issues if the application needs to change the URL at runtime, or if the URL is sensitive.

2. The code is not validating the URL before usage. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the URL is malformed.

3. The code does not handle exceptions in a meaningful way. If a network error occurs during URL creation, the code will print the stack trace and exit. It would be more robust to handle this exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.

Here's an updated version of the code with these considerations:

```java
public class H1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int choice = 2;
        String urlString = "http://www.facebook.com";
        if(choice > 1)
            urlString = "https://www.google.com";
        try {
            URL url = new URL(urlString);
            System.out.println(url);
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid URL: " + urlString);
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that this code still does not contain any CWE-related security issues.
