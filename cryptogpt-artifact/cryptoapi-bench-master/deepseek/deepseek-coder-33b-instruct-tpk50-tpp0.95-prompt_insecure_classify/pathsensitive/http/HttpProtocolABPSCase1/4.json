The provided code does not contain any misuses of cryptographic API. It's simply creating a URL object using a string, which is a common operation in Java. There's no cryptography being used in this code. 

If the string "url" were to be used in a HTTP request or some other network communication context, I would recommend using HTTPS by default and only using HTTP if the user specifically requests it. This would protect the communication by encrypting the data.

However, as of now, the code is not vulnerable to the following misuses of cryptographic API:

- CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
- CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation. 
- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
- CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength. (e.g. Low key/salt length or iteration number, static password/salt...)
- CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.
- CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.
