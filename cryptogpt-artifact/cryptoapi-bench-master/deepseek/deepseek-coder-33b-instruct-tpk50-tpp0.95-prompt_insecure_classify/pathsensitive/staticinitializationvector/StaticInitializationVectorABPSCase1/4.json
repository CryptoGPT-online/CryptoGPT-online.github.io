The code snippet you provided doesn't have any major misuses of the crypto API. However, there are a few points that can be improved or considered:

1. Use of an Insufficiently Random Value: The IV (Initialization Vector) in the example code is static and the same for each execution, which is not recommended for security reasons. The IV is used to ensure the uniqueness and the freshness of the encrypted data.

2. Hard-Coded Key: The key used in the example code is generated at runtime and isn't hard-coded. This is a good practice to prevent the accidental disclosure of the encryption key.

Here's the code revised:

```java
import javax.crypto.*;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class S1 {
    public void go(int choice) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(128);  // This will generate a 128-bit key.
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();

        byte[] bytes = new byte[16];
        sr.nextBytes(bytes);  // This will generate a random IV each time.

        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        S1 siv = new S1();
        int choice = 2;
        siv.go(choice);
    }
}
```

Note: Always remember, no matter how good your cryptography is, if the key can be guessed, then your cryptography is worthless. Therefore, it is a best practice to use a secure and secret key or even better generate and store it somewhere secure. In real-world applications, key management should be considered.
