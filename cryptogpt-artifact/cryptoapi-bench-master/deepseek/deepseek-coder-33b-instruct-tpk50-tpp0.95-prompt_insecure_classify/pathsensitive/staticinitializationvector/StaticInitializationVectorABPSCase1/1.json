The provided code seems to be securely using cryptographic algorithms and keys. However, you should consider the usage of the SecureRandom instance `sr`. A common misuse is that the same SecureRandom instance is used to generate the key, the IV (initialization vector), and other sensitive information. 

If an attacker can guess or predict the sequence of random numbers produced by `sr`, they could possibly break the encryption. Using the same `SecureRandom` instance for both key and IV in `Cipher.init` is insecure and should be avoided.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
public class S1 {
    public void go(int choice) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");

        byte [] bytes = "abcde".getBytes();

        if(choice>1){
            bytes = new byte[16];
            sr.nextBytes(bytes);
        }

        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        S1 siv = new S1();
        int choice = 2;
        siv.go(choice);
    }

}
```

In this version, a separate `SecureRandom` instance `sr` is used to generate the IV.
