The code is not susceptible to the following security risks:

- CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. The used algorithms ("AES" and "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding") are widely accepted as safe.
- CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation. There is no certificate validation here.
- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values. The provided code is not generating insufficiently random values.
- CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength. The provided code is using secure values for the AES key and IV, which are both 16 bytes long, which is secure length.
- CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials. There are no hardcoded credentials in this code.
- CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation. The negotiation of "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" is not performed.

Please note that it's important to remember that security risks can also arise due to poor coding practices, such as using weak passwords, storing sensitive data in insecure locations, and not closing streams when they're no longer needed. Always ensure that your application has been developed with best security practices.
