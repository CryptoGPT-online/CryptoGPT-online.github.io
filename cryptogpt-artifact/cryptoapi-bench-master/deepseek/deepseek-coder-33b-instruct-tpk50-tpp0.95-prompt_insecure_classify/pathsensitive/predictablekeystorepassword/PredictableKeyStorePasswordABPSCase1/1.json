The code you posted is using a hard-coded string ("changeit") as a default key for a KeyStore. This is insecure and could lead to potential issues, as the string could be found and misused. Furthermore, the random key generation part is not very secure. It uses the `SecureRandom` class to generate a random integer stream, but this integer stream is then converted to a String, which could lead to insecure usage of cryptographic keys.

In terms of the CWE classification, this falls under:

- CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

Here is how to fix these issues:

```java
public class P1 {
    URL cacerts;
    public static void main(String args[]) throws KeyStoreException, IOException, CertificateException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        P1 pksp = new P1();
        int choice=2;
        pksp.go(choice);
    }

    public void go(int choice) throws KeyStoreException, IOException, CertificateException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String type = "JKS";
        KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);
        cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com");
        String defaultKey = System.getProperty("your.property.name.for.key");
        if(choice>1){
            SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
            byte[] key = new byte[16]; // AES-128 is 16 bytes
            random.nextBytes(key);
            defaultKey = new String(key, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        }
        ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());
    }
}
```

This way, the defaultKey is not hard-coded, and it's generated randomly, which is more secure. The random key is generated as bytes, which are then converted to a string using UTF-8 encoding. This key can then be used to load the KeyStore. The key should be stored in a secure manner, not in the code or source files.
