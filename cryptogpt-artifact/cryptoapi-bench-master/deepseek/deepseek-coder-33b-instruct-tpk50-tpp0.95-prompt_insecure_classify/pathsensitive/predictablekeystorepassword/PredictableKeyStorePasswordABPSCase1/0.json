        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\ndefaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
        "description": "The code creates a SecureRandom object to generate a random key. However, generating random keys by using the SecureRandom class can be potentially insecure because the random keys generated by SecureRandom class may not provide enough randomness to be secure. This misuse of crypto API can potentially result in less secure encryption.",
        "recommendation": "It's recommended to use a cryptographic random number generator that's designed to generate secure random numbers for generating encryption keys, rather than relying on SecureRandom. Also, consider using a password-based encryption scheme that can be configured with secure random numbers."

        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());",
        "description": "The code uses the 'JKS' type of KeyStore which is a traditional format used to store cryptographic keys and certificates. However, the default 'JKS' format is less secure than others like 'PKCS12' and 'BCFKS'. Selection of less secure algorithms can lead to the leakage of confidential information during key exchange.",
        "recommendation": "It's recommended to use a more secure KeyStore type that would protect against attacks such as brute-force or dictionary attacks. If key encryption is required, use strong encryption algorithms such as AES with key size of at least 256 bits."

        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());",
        "description": "The code uses a hard-coded default password as a key to load the KeyStore. Using hard-coded password can increase the risk of attacks and can be easily guessed by attackers. The encryption strength of the KeyStore depends on the strength of the password used to encrypt it.",
        "recommendation": "It's recommended to use a randomly generated, long, and complex key to encrypt the KeyStore. This would make it more secure and harder to guess."
