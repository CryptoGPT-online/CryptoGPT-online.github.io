The provided Java code is using a hardcoded key and generating a random key when a certain condition is met. However, there are a few misuses that can be identified:

1. Use of a Hardcoded Key: The hardcoded key "defaultkey" is used when "choice" is not greater than 1. This is a security risk as the key can be easily discovered or guessed.

2. Use of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation: The SecureRandom class is used to generate a random key, which might not provide a secure randomness.

3. Inadequate Encryption Strength: The AES key length is not at the recommended length of 128, 192 or 256 bits. It should be at least 128 bits for AES.
