  "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
  "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
  "description": "The code creates an AES key with a length of 16 bytes. Although AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, using a key size of 16 bytes is considered weak security practice.",
  "recommendation": "Generate a key using a secure and appropriate key size. For AES, you can choose 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits. Consider using a cryptographic library to handle secure key generation for you."
