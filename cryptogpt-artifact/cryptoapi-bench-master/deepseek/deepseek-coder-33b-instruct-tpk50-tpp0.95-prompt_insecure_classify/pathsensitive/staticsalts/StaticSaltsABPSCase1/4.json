The code you provided uses PBE (Password-Based Encryption) which is a standard method of Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE). The algorithm used in this code is not specified, but by default, PBE uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2).

One issue with this code is the initialization of the salt. In this case, the salt is initialized with a hard-coded byte array {(byte) 0xa2}. If the attacker has control over the values for choice variable, they can use that as a mechanism to guess the salt.

If you want to use a randomly generated salt, you should replace the hard-coded salt with a call to sr2.nextBytes(salt). This way, you will generate a random salt whenever the choice variable is greater than 1.

Here's a fixed version of your code:

```java
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEParameterSpec;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class S1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        S1 cs = new S1();
        int choice=2;
        cs.key2(choice);
    }

    public void key2(int choice){
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        SecureRandom sr2 = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] salt = new byte[16]; // use a random 16-byte salt
        if(choice>1)
            sr2.nextBytes(salt);
        int count = 1020;
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
    }
}
```

This fix prevents the use of hard-coded salt values and instead uses a randomly generated salt. However, there is no guarantee that using random salt will make the encryption more secure. The salt used should not be kept secret. It is best practice to use a different random salt for each encryption.
