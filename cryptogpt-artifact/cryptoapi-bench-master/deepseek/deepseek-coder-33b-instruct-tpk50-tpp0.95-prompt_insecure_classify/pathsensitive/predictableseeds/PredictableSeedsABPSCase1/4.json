The given code contains the following crypto API misuse:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
        "description": "The use of SecureRandom with a deterministic seed like byte [] {(byte) 100, (byte) 200} can lead to predictable and insecure outputs.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure seed for SecureRandom or a non-deterministic seed. Consider using SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() if it's available, which may be slower but more secure."
    }
]
```
