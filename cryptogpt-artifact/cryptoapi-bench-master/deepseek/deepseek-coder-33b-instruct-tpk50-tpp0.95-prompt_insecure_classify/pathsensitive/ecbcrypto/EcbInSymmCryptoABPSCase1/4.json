Here are the cryptographic API misuses:

1. Usage of Static Key: The key is generated on each method call, this means that the same key is used for encryption on all method calls. A static key should be used only for testing and debugging purposes. It's risky to use the same key for multiple encryptions because it leads to a weak cryptographic system.

2. Use of ECB mode of operation: ECB is an unsafe block mode of operation because it doesn't hide data patterns well. If your code is for handling sensitive information, ECB mode should be avoided. 

Here is the JSON response:
