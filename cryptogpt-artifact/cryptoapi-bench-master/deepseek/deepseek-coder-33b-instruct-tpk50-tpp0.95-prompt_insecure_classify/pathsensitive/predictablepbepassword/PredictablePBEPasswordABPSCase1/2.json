The code has several issues that result in misuse of cryptographic algorithms. These issues include:

1. Generating key through SecureRandom#ints(): While it is common practice to use SecureRandom#nextBytes() for generating secure byte arrays, in this code, we generate a string using SecureRandom#ints() which is not a good practice because it generates a stream of integers, not a byte array.

2. Using a low iteration count and a static salt: This code uses a low iteration count (11010) and a static salt, which are commonly recognized as weak configurations in cryptographic systems. An attacker can use these details to quickly crack the encryption, reducing the security provided by the encryption.

3. Using a hardcoded key: If the defaultKey is set to a hardcoded value, an attacker who can see the code will be able to easily use this key for decryption.
