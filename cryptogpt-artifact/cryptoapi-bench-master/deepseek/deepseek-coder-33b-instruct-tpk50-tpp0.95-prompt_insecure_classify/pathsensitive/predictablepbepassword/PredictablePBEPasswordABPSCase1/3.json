Misuse: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

Misuse Code Snippets: 

```java
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());
```

Description: The above code snippet does not generate a truly random string. The SecureRandom class does not return a unique, random string each time it is invoked. Rather, it generates a unique, random int stream each time it is invoked. So, it's highly recommended to use a proper string generator to generate a truly random string instead of using SecureRandom.

Recommendation: Use a proper string generator to generate a truly random string.

Misuse: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.

Misuse Code Snippets: 

```java
int iterationCount = 11010;
int keyLength = 16;
```

Description: The iteration count and key length are very high. While iteration counts do affect the security of a password, they also increase the computational cost for an attacker. Moreover, a key length of 16 might be too short for modern standards, which recommend a minimum key length of 256 bits for AES.

Recommendation: Reduce the iteration count and key length to more secure values.
