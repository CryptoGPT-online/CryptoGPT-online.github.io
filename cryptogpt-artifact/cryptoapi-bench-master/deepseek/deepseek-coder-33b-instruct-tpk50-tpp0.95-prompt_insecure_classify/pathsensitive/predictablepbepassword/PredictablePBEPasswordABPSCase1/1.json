The code you provided uses PBE (Password-Based Encryption) with a low iteration count. PBE is generally seen as a good choice for password hashing, but the iteration count is very low (11010). The iteration count is a key parameter in the hashing process, which increases the time it takes for the hashing algorithm to run, thus making it harder for an attacker to crack the password using a brute-force approach. Lower iteration counts reduce the time needed to brute-force a password, which can make it easier for an attacker to carry out a brute-force attack.

    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The salt value is generated using a non-cryptographic pseudo-random number generator (java.util.Random). This can lead to predictable salts, making the password hash more susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of java.util.Random, SecureRandom should be used. This provides a cryptographically strong random number generator."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;\nint keyLength = 16;",
        "description": "The iteration count and key length for the PBE algorithm are both very low. This reduces the time it takes to generate the key and makes the algorithm more vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks.",
        "recommendation": "The iteration count and key length should be increased. Recommended values depend on the required level of security."
