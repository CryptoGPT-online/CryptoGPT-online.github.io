Here are the misuses in the provided code snippet:

[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
    "description": "The MD5 hash function is considered broken and is no longer suitable for use in cryptographic applications due to collisions, vulnerability and less resistance against hash attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using stronger cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256, SHA-3 or BCrypt instead of MD5."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")",
    "description": "SHA-256 uses a predetermined salt and not enough randomness which makes the encryption weaker.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using salt (or pepper) for increased security, where each password is hashed with a unique random string rather than a shared string. This greatly increases the time and resources needed to crack a password."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
    "vulnerable_code": "choice = 2",
    "description": "The 'choice' value is hardcoded to 2, where it seems like the developer might have a use case that's changing the algorithm based on a configuration or condition but it is hardcoded, thus making it a static vulnerability.",
    "recommendation": "Hardcoded credentials should be avoided in the code. If the change is a condition based, use a secure method to inject or get this value dynamically."
  }
