The provided Java code is using the MessageDigest API incorrectly. It uses the SHA-256 algorithm which provides more security than MD5, but it is not used based on a condition, which might lead to potential misuse.

Here are the misuses identified:

1. Insecure use of crypto API:

```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
if(choice>1)
    md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```

In the above code, the choice is checked to switch to SHA-256. This is a risky cryptographic algorithm and it is generally recommended to stick to secure algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-3 etc.

The misuse is identified as follows:

```json
[{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
  "description": "The use of SHA-256 is seen as risky as it is not used based on a condition.",
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to always use the same cryptographic algorithm throughout the entire code."
}]
```

Please note that the code is not printing the digest in any meaningful way and the System.out.println(md.digest()) will not print the hash correctly. The line should be replaced with:

```java
byte[] digest = md.digest();
System.out.println(new String(digest));
```

This will convert the digest to a string and print the hash. However, since the digest is a byte array, it will not be printable, and it is recommended to use a library like Apache Commons Codec for digest to hex conversion.
