The code you provided uses MessageDigest, which is a part of Java's cryptography API, to hash a string. The string is hashed with either the "MD4" or "SHA-256" algorithm, depending on the value of a variable "choice".

This is a classic example of how a developer could potentially introduce a security misuse when using the cryptography API.

1. The developer uses the cryptographic hash function MD4. MD4 is an older algorithm and it has been known for security vulnerabilities. It should not be used in new applications.

2. The developer does not use a salt when hashing the password. A salt adds random data to the input of a hash function to guarantee a unique output even for identical inputs. This makes it harder for attackers to precompute the hash.

Here are the fixes for the security misuses:

- Replace the MD4 with a secure hash function like SHA-256 or SHA-3.
- Add a salt to the hashed string to prevent attackers from using pre-computed tables.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class B3 {
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String name = "abcdef";
        int choice = 2;
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        if(choice>1)
            md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");

        // Add a random salt to the string before hashing
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] salt = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(salt);

        md.update(salt);
        md.update(name.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        System.out.println(md.digest());
    }
}
```

I used the SHA-256 as a recommended hash function and added a random salt to the string. Also, I used the UTF_8 charset when getting the bytes from the string.
