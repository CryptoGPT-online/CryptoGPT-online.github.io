Misuse Type: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
Misuse Code Snippets:
```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD4");
if(choice>1)
    md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```
Description: The above code is using MD4, a broken cryptographic algorithm, to compute the digest of the "name" string. MD4 has known security vulnerabilities and collisions. It is recommended to use stronger, more secure hash functions like SHA-256.
Recommendation: Replace "MD4" with "SHA-256" or another secure cryptographic algorithm.

Please note that the above code has a static string "name" and the choice variable is hard-coded to be greater than 1. In a real world scenario, user inputs could change these values. Depending on the actual inputs, you might need to adjust the recommendations accordingly.
