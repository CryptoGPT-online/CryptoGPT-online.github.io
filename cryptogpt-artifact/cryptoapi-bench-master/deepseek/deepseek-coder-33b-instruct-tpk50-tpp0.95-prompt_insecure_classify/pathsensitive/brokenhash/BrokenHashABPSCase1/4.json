The code you've provided is using the MessageDigest API for generating hash values. However, it uses an SHA1 algorithm which has been determined to be vulnerable and is no longer recommended for secure use. 

The code also has a variable 'choice' which could influence the chosen algorithm, which could lead to code injection attacks or make the code behave in an unintended way.

Also, calling 'System.out.println(md.digest())' directly might reveal sensitive information like the hash function values which should not be printed directly.

So, here are the potential misuses and corresponding recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
        "description": "The SHA1 hash algorithm is considered no longer secure and is easily breakable. Use of this algorithm could lead to data integrity issues.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using stronger algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
        "vulnerable_code": "if(choice>1) \n\t\t md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
        "description": "This code might lead to insecure use of SHA-256 algorithm due to a 'choice' variable. This could lead to a 'time-of-check to time-of-use' (TOCTTOU) race condition.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the choice of algorithm should be static and does not change during execution. Use hardcoded values and not user controlled ones."
    }
]
```
