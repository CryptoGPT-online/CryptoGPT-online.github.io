        "vulnerable_code": "md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
        "description": "SHA-256 is a strong algorithm, but if SHA-256 is not necessary for the user's current requirement, it may be a security risk to use it. In this case, the SHA-256 is not in use unless 'choice' is greater than 1 which is a risk as 'choice' can be set by a user input or environment variable.",
        "recommendation": "You should use a standard and secure algorithm for your application. In this case, it might be better to use 'SHA-1' which is not vulnerable to length extension attacks as a matter of course. It is still recommended to use SHA-2 and above for security purposes unless you have a specific need for SHA-1."

        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "Using SHA1 or SHA-256.",
        "description": "SHA1 and SHA-256 are two old cryptographic hash functions. They have known weaknesses (Collision and Length Extension attacks), and they might not provide sufficient security for modern purposes. Using them might expose the users' data to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using stronger cryptographic hash functions, like SHA-3. Or if you are developing for browsers, consider using Web Cryptography API, which provides cryptographic operations in a way that is secure and efficient."
