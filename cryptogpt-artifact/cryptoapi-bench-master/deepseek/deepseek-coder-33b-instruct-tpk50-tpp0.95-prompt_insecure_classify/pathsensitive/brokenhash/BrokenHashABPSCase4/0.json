The code you've provided doesn't contain a cryptographic API misuse. However, I noticed that you are printing the digest in the console. This should not be done in real-world application for security reasons because the digest will be in byte format. Instead, you should convert it to a string with Base64 encoding or hexadecimal for a more human-readable format.

Here's how to do it:

```java
public class B4 {
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String name = "abcdef";
        int choice = 2;
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD2");
        if(choice>1)
            md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        md.update(name.getBytes());
        byte[] digest = md.digest();
        
        // Convert the byte array to a hexadecimal string
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (byte b : digest) {
            sb.append(String.format("%02x", b & 0xff));
        }
        String digestStr = sb.toString();

        System.out.println(digestStr);
    }
}
```
Please note that this fix is not about fixing the misuse, but addressing a common issue with using the digest result.
