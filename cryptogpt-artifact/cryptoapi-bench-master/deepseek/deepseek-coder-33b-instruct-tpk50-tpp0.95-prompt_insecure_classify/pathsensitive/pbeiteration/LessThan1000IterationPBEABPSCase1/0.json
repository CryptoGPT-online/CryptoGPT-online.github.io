Misuse: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

Misuse Code Snippet:

```java
PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
```

Description: The iteration count used to derive the PBE key from the password is less than the default recommended value of 10,000. Using such a small iteration count increases the risk of brute force attacks.

Recommendation: Increase the iteration count to a value of at least 10,000, or better yet, use the recommended default value.

```java
int count = 10000; // recommended default
PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
```

Keep in mind that increasing the iteration count will also increase the time it takes to derive the PBE key from the password, which could be a concern depending on your use case.
