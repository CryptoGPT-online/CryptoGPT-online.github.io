There are no misuses in this code. It's a secure use of PBKDF2, which is a recommended standard for key derivation. The salt and count are randomly generated, which helps in strengthening the security. The iteration count 'count' is set dynamically based on the 'choice' variable which makes the key derivation process more flexible and customizable. 

Please review the code and ensure it is secure according to the security best practices for your use case.
