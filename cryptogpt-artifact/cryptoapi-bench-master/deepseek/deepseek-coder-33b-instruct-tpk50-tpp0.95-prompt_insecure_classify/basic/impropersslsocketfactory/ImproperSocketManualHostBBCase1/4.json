There seems to be no misuse of the cryptography API in the provided code. The code simply creates an SSL socket connection to a specified host. However, it does not use any specific cryptographic algorithms, cipher suites, or keys. 

But it's worth noting that this code doesn't configure the SSLSocket to verify the server's certificate. This can make the connection susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks if the server's certificate is not properly verified.

If you want to ensure that the server's certificate is verified, you should use the following code:

```java
SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket("my.host.name", 443);

// Important to do this after creating the socket
// This will throw an exception if the server's certificate is not valid.
socket.startHandshake();
```

With this code, you are taking advantage of the SSLSocket's ability to automatically verify the server's certificate. It will throw an SSLException if the certificate is invalid.

If this code is not sufficient for your needs, you may want to consider using a more robust security library such as Apache HttpClient, which provides additional features for verifying the server's certificate.
