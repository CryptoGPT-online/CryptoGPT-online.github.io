The code you've provided has no cryptographic misuses, it's just using the `SecureRandom` class in Java's standard library to generate a random number. However, there are a few things you might want to consider:

1. Using a single byte for seeding a random number generator can lead to predictable numbers, so it's generally not recommended.
2. You're using `SecureRandom` with a byte array seed. If the contents of the array are already known or can be guessed by an attacker, they could potentially predict the future output of the random number generator.

So, the code isn't technically "wrong" but it's not a good practice. However, it doesn't expose any crypto API misuses that I can identify. Here is how you might improve the code:

```java
public class P2 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] seed = new byte[32]; // 256 bits of randomness
        sr.nextBytes(seed);
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

This code generates a secure random seed of 256 bits (32 bytes) which should provide more randomness. The `nextInt` method then generates a random integer based on this seed. 

In terms of crypto API misuses, your code doesn't expose any.
