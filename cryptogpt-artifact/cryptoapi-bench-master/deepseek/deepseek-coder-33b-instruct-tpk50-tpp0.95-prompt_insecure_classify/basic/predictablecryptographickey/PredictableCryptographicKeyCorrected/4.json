The code is insecure due to the following reasons:

1. The key generation using SecureRandom is not suitable for generating encryption keys. The SecureRandom class provides a cryptographically strong random number generator, but the output of this class is not suitable for directly using as a secret key. 

2. The key length of AES is fixed at 128 bits (16 bytes), and it's best to generate this key using a suitable algorithm. In the provided code, a random string is generated, converted into bytes, and then truncated or padded to 16 bytes. This can cause cryptographic weaknesses, as it will allow attackers to try and brute force the key size.

3. The code does not provide an Initialization Vector (IV) for the CBC mode of operation, which is a requirement for using AES in CBC mode.

4. The code converts the original string into bytes using UTF-8 encoding, which could potentially allow for encoding attacks if the input string contains malicious content.

5. The encrypted result is converted into a Base64 string for storage or transmission, which may not be necessary if the encrypted result will be stored or transmitted directly as bytes.

To fix these issues, a secure way to generate the secret key and IV should be used, and the original string should be properly encoded. Here is the corrected version:

```java
public class Pd {
    public static void main(String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, IOException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, ClassNotFoundException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(128); // for example, use AES with 128-bit key
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING");
        byte[] ivBytes = new byte[cipher.getBlockSize()];
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        random.nextBytes(ivBytes);
        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes);

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);

        String originalString = "Testing";
        byte[] originalBytes = originalString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(originalBytes);
        
        System.out.println(Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes));

        // To decrypt
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);
        byte[] decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(encryptedBytes);
        String decryptedString = new String(decryptedBytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

        System.out.println(decryptedString);

    }
}
```
In this code, the KeyGenerator class is used to generate a secure random AES key, and the IvParameterSpec class is used to generate a secure random IV. The original string is converted to bytes using the UTF-8 charset, which provides a reliable encoding for Unicode text.
