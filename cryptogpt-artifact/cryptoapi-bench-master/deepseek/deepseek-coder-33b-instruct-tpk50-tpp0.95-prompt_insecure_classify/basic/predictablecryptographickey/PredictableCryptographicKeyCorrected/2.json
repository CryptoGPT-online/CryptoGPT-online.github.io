The code you've shared is susceptible to several security misuses:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

   The AES algorithm is used here, but not with the recommended mode of operation. Although AES can be secure, it is generally recommended to use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-GCM) mode as it provides both confidentiality and integrity in a single pass.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

   The SecureRandom class is used to generate a random key. However, the "random.ints()" method is used, which is not necessarily creating a truly random key. 

3. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

   The AES key is created with a size of 16 bytes. The AES algorithm requires a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits for 16, 24, or 32 byte key sizes respectively. However, the key size here is 32 bytes, which is smaller than the recommended size.

4. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation

   The cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING") method is called. "CBC" mode of operation is a standard mode for encryption. However, if the encryption is done in a network environment, where other users have the potential to intercept the cipher text, "ECB" mode of operation should be used instead of "CBC".

The improved code might look something like this:

```java
public class Pd {
    public static void main(String [] args) throws Exception {
        SecureRandom random = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong();
        if(random == null) {
            throw new Exception("No SecureRandom instance available");
        }
        byte[] defaultKey = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(defaultKey);

        String originalString = "Testing";
        SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(defaultKey, "AES");

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec);
        byte[] encrypt = cipher.doFinal(originalString.getBytes("UTF-8"));
        String encryptString = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encrypt);
        System.out.println(encryptString);
    }
}
```

The changes include:

- Using SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to get a strong instance of SecureRandom.
- Generating the key using SecureRandom's `nextBytes()` method.
- Using a key size of 16 bytes, which is the recommended size for AES.
- Switching to AES-GCM mode of operation, for both integrity and confidentiality.
- Using "NoPadding" with GCM, as it removes the padding.
