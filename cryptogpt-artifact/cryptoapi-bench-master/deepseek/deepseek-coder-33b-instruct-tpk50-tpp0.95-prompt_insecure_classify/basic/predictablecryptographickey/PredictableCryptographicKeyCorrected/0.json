The code has the following misuses:

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values: The SecureRandom class is used to generate a key, but this key is not cryptographically strong. It can be easily guessed.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength: The code uses a weak encryption algorithm AES with a key length of 16 bytes. AES with a 128-bit key is considered to be a weak encryption due to attacks like meet-in-the-middle (Meet-in-the-middle attack).

```java
String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());
byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();
```

3. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The code uses the 'AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING' cipher. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a mode of operation for a block cipher, which may expose sensitive information if it is used in ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode which is not secure.

```java
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec);
```

The recommended fix for all these issues is to use a secure random generator for generating the key, a strong encryption algorithm, and use a secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM.
