This code is misusing cryptographic API as it uses a default key for AES encryption, which is not secure. The key used is hardcoded and not kept secret, which means anyone who can access the code can also access the encryption key.

Misuse: 
Use of Hardcoded Credentials.

Vulnerable Code:
```java
String defaultKey = "defaultkey";
```

Description:
The key "defaultkey" is hardcoded in the code, which is not secure. Anyone who has access to the code can get this key. 

Recommendation: 
Secrets like cryptographic keys must never be hard-coded in the code. They should be stored in secure storage and accessed at runtime. If the code is for testing or development purposes, it should generate and store these keys in a secure location. For production code, consider using libraries like Java Key Store (JKS) or the Keychain for secure storage of these keys.
