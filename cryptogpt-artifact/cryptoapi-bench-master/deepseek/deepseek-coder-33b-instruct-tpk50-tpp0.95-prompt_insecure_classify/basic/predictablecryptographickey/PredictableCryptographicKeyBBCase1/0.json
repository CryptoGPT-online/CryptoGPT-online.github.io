This code sample creates an AES key using a default key string that is then copied to a fixed size of 16 bytes.

This is a misuse of the crypto API and classifies into the following categories:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: 
   The code uses AES, a known-broken symmetric cryptography algorithm. It is recommended to use more secure algorithms such as RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), etc.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values:
   The key used here is deterministically derived from a string. As a result, the same key is always used for encryption and decryption, which significantly reduces the security of the encryption.

3. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength:
   AES is specified as having 128-bit encryption, however, the key is specified as 16 bytes, which is 128 bits only. 

In conclusion, while the program will run without errors, it is not using a secure method of key generation and encryption, and using AES is a bad idea.

Here is a suggested fix:

```java
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class P1 {
    public static void main(String [] args){
        SecureRandom rand = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] keyBytes = new byte[16]; // 128 bit key
        rand.nextBytes(keyBytes);
        SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, a randomly generated 128-bit key is generated using a SecureRandom instance. This key is then used for encryption.
