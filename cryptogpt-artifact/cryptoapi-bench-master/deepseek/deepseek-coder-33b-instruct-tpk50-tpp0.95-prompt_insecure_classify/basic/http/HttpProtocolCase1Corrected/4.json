This code is not directly dealing with cryptography, it's just creating a URL object and printing it. There doesn't appear to be any cryptographic operations or cryptographic API misuses in this code. The URL class in Java does not seem to have any insecure uses that would violate any known cryptographic security principles. 

If you were to extend this code to, say, access a URL via HTTPS, then there might be a risk of a man-in-the-middle attack, or potential insecure cipher suites being used (as HTTPS/SSL requires secure cipher suites). However, this would involve more than just creating a URL, and wouldn't be properly handled here.

So, as it stands, there's no cryptographic API misuses in this code. But please, ensure you're using cryptographic APIs securely when you're handling sensitive data and when you're implementing authentication and authorization protocols.
