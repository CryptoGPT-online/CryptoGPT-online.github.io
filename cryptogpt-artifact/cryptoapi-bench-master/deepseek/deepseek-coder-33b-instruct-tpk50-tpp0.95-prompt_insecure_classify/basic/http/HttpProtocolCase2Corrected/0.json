The code provided is not directly involving the usage of insecure or risky cryptographic algorithms. However, it does use the `URL` class in a way that could potentially lead to a security risk, and thus it should be addressed.

The `URL` class in Java is used to represent and manipulate Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and URLs. The `URL` constructor can throw `MalformedURLException` if the URL string is malformed. In this case, the `go` method throws `MalformedURLException` when it is called, potentially making it necessary to handle this exception at the call site.

A possible risk here is that the URL string could be contructed with user input, which could be manipulated to cause the `MalformedURLException` to be thrown. This could potentially be used in an attack where an attacker is trying to exploit the program to break it or cause it to behave in an unintended way.

Here is a suggested fix:

```java
public class Hd {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        String url = "https://www.google.com";
        go(url);
    }

    private static void go(String url) {
        try {
            System.out.println(new URL(url));
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
```

Here, the `go` method catches the `MalformedURLException` and simply prints the stack trace. This is more appropriate in some cases where the program can continue to run despite the error. However, in many cases it may be best to let the exception be thrown so that it can be handled in a higher level of the program.
