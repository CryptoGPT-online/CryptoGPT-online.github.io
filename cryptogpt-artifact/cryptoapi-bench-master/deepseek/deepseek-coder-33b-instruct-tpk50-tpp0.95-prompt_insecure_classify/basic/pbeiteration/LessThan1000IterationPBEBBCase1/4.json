        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The PBEParameterSpec object is being initialized with an iteration count of 20, which is quite low. Low iteration counts can make the hashing process faster and easier to brute force. Also, iterations should increase in proportion with computing power to make it harder to brute force.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher number, e.g., 1000 or more. This is typically recommended as a good baseline, but can be increased even further for stronger security."
