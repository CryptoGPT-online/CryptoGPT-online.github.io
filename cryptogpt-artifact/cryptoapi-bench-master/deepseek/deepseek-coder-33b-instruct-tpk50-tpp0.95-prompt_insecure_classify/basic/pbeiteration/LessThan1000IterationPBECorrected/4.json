The code you provided is indeed insecure due to the usage of SecureRandom. The SecureRandom class is not safe if the underlying system's source of random numbers isn't safe. 

The PBEParameterSpec and its iteration count are both weak in terms of security. PBEParameterSpec should use a secure random number for the salt, and the iteration count is set to a low value of 1020, which is too low for modern standards.
