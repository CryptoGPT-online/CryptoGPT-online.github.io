The code snippet provided appears to be secure. It retrieves an instance of the MessageDigest class using the "SHA-256" algorithm, which is considered a secure hash function and is widely accepted. The use of "SHA-256" does not result in a Crypto API misuse per se, but it's always important to verify that the algorithms you're using are the correct ones for your use case, as using an algorithm with a security weakness can lead to vulnerabilities.

It's also worth noting that the exception handling in your code is correct. Even if an unsupported algorithm is passed into the `getInstance()` method, it will throw a `NoSuchAlgorithmException`, which is caught and handled correctly.
