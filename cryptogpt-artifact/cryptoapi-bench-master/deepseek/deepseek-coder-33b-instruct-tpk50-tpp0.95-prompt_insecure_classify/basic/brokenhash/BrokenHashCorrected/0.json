The code provided does not contain a specific misuse of a cryptographic API as it does not involve any direct misuse. 

However, it's worth noting that cryptographic algorithms are typically secure and shouldn't be misused, but a misuse might happen in different scenarios. For example, an insecure algorithm could be selected during negotiation (CWE-757), a static key or salt could be used (CWE-330, CWE-326), or cryptographic operations could be done without a secure randomness (CWE-330, CWE-326). 

Please provide more specific code or scenarios for a more detailed analysis.
