Misuse identified: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

Vulnerable code snippet:

```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD2");
```

Description: The MD2 cryptographic algorithm is considered insecure and weak. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and length extension attacks, making it less secure for current use. This code uses MD2, which is considered to be weak and unfit for most current cryptographic applications.

Recommendation: Use a stronger, more secure cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256. Here's how you can modify the code:

```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```
