Here is the vulnerability:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "MD5 is a weak, broken cryptographic hash function which was widely used in the past. It is no longer considered cryptographically secure. An attacker can generate a message that produces a hash collision, or find preimage attacks that will allow them to generate specific hashes. Also, it is no longer part of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-2).",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using MD5, it is strongly recommended to use SHA-256 or the stronger SHA-3. Always use the cryptographic API calls securely and make sure they are up-to-date. Never use deprecated or weak cryptographic algorithms. Use stronger, more modern and recommended ones."
