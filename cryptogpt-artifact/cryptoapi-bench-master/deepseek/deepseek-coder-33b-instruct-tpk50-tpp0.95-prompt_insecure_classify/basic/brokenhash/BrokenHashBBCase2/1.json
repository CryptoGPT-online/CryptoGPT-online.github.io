The provided Java code uses the `MessageDigest` class to compute the MD5 hash of a string "abcdef". MD5 is a weak and broken hashing algorithm and it is not recommended to use it for any reason. 

This misuse is CWE-327: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm". The use of MD5 is not safe because it is vulnerable to a number of attacks and has been broken. It should be replaced with a stronger algorithm like SHA-256 or a modern hash function like BLAKE2 or Argon2.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

public class B2 {
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String name = "abcdef";
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        byte[] hash = md.digest(name.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        StringBuilder hexString = new StringBuilder();
        for (byte b : hash) {
            String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & b);
            if(hex.length() == 1) hexString.append('0');
            hexString.append(hex);
        }
        System.out.println(hexString.toString());
    }
}
```

In this version, the algorithm is changed to SHA-256 and the digest is converted to a hexadecimal string for easier readability.
