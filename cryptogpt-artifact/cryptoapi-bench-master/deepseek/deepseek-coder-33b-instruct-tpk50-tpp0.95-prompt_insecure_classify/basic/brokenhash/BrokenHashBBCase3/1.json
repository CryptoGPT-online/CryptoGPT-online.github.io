    "description": "MD4 is a broken cryptographic hash function which is considered to be insecure against both collision and preimage attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic hash function like SHA-256. Or if you need to use a broken hash function, you should know what you are doing and take additional steps like strengthening keying material or using a secure salt."
