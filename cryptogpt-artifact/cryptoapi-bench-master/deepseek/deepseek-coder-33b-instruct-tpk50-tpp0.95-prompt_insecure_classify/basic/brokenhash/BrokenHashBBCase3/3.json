The misuse in the given code is:

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD4");
```

This code is using MD4 as a cryptographic algorithm. MD4 is a hash function that is considered weak and it has known vulnerabilities. It should not be used for secure applications.

Instead, use a strong cryptographic hash function like SHA-256, SHA-3, or Bcrypt.

```java
String name = "abcdef";
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
md.update(name.getBytes());
System.out.println(md.digest());
```

This code is now using SHA-256 as the cryptographic algorithm, which is a secure and widely accepted cryptographic algorithm.
