The code is using PBE (Password-Based Encryption) with PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2), which is a good choice for cryptographic key derivation. However, it sets the iteration count to 11010, which is a much larger number than recommended (the NIST recommends a minimum of 10,000 iterations). This could lead to high CPU usage during key derivation, which could potentially make the system less secure. Furthermore, it uses a static array `{'s'}` as the password, which is not secure and could be guessed.

The code also uses a statically sized salt array, which is also not secure. The size of the salt should be as large as the hash function output (which is not defined here, but it should be at least 128 bits), so a size of 16 bytes is quite small.

In conclusion, the code has several potential security misuses:

        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the salt, and make the salt as large as the output of the hash function."
