The code provided has a number of potential crypto API misuses:

1. The iteration count is not random. It is set to a specific value of 11010. This is an insecure use of the crypto API as a constant iteration count may lead to vulnerabilities depending on the strength of the hardware.

2. The key length is set to a specific value of 16. This is a risky use of the crypto API as smaller key lengths are often used for testing purposes and may compromise the security of the system.

3. The password is generated using `random.ints()`, which will return an `IntStream` object, and it is then converted to a String. This is not a secure way of generating a random password as it is not truly random and may be predictable.

4. The password is used as a `PBEKeySpec` without hashing. It's better to hash the password before using it as it adds an extra layer of security.

5. The salt is created from a `SecureRandom` and then used directly. A `SecureRandom` object should be used only once, for generating the salt, and then stored and used only as a salt.

6. The password, salt, and iteration count are used directly without proper validation. This could allow a malicious user to control these values and potentially manipulate the PBEKeySpec, leading to vulnerabilities.

Here's a more secure version of your code:

```java
public class Pd {
    private PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = null;
    private PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;

    public static void main(String [] args){
        Pd ckp = new Pd();
        ckp.key();
    }
    public void key() {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte [] salt = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        int iterationCount = 10000 + random.nextInt(10000); // Use random number between 10000 and 20000.
        int keyLength = 256; // Use a high key length for security.
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256"); // Use a hashed password.
        byte[] password = md.digest(random.generateSeed(16)); // Generate random password.
        pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password,salt,iterationCount,keyLength);
    }
}
```

This version of the code includes more secure random password generation, a random salt, and a random iteration count. It uses `SecureRandom` to generate a random password and use `SHA-256` for hashing the password. The PBEKeySpec uses a high key length for security.

Please note that this is only a general example and the actual security measures may vary based on your specific requirements.
