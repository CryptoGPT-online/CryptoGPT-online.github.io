The provided code seems to be using a PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm, specifically PBKDF2, which is a good choice for password-based key derivation. 

However, there are several issues with the code:

1. The line `String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());` is generating a random stream of integers, but it is not converting them into a human-readable password.
2. The `iterationCount` is set to 11010, which is a rather low number. According to OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), the PBKDF2 iteration count should be at least 1,000,000.
3. The salt's length of 16 bytes is quite low. It's recommended to use a minimum of 16 bytes for a salt (as per NIST SP 800-132).
4. The `keyLength` is set to 16 bytes, which is considered to be too short and thus, insecure. It's recommended to use at least 256 bits.

Here are the recommendations to fix these issues:

1. Use a function to generate a more secure password.
2. Increase the iteration count to at least 1,000,000.
3. Increase the length of the salt to 16 bytes or more.
4. Increase the key length to at least 256 bits (32 bytes).

Here's the updated code:

```java
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
import java.util.Random;

public class Pd {
    private PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = null;

    public static void main(String [] args){
        Pd ckp = new Pd();
        ckp.key();
    }

    public void key() {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        String password = generateRandomPassword(random);
        byte [] salt = new byte[16]; // Increase the length of salt
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        int iterationCount = 1000000; // Increase the iteration count
        int keyLength = 32; // Increase the key length
        pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, iterationCount, keyLength * 8);
    }

    private static String generateRandomPassword(SecureRandom random) {
        String characters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789~`@#$%^&*()-_=+[{]};:',<.>/?";
        String password = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) { // Increase the length of password
            password += characters.charAt(random.nextInt(characters.length()));
        }
        return password;
    }
}
```

Please note, the exact values for salt length, iteration count, and key length could vary depending on the specific cryptographic requirements and resources of the system. This is just a general recommendation. Always consider your specific needs and constraints when choosing these parameters.
