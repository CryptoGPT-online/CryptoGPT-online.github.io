Misuses:

1. Hardcoded passwords: The password used in this code is created using `SecureRandom` which generates a random String. However, this is hardcoded password which may lead to insecure cryptographic key usage. It's recommended to use a fixed or random password instead of this method.

2. Low Iteration count: The iteration count (11010) used in this code is quite low which can lead to shorter runtime for cryptographic operations. It is recommended to use at least 1000 iterations as a best practice.
