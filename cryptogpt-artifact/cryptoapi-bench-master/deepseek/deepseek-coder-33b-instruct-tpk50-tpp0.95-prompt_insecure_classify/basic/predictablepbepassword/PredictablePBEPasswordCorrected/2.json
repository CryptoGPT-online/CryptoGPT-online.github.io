This code is insecure and violates the following misuses of the crypto API:

1. Use of Hardcoded Credentials: The variable 'password' is generated using a SecureRandom instance, however, the password is not securely used in a real-world scenario. In production-level code, a hard-coded password should never be used.

2. Insufficient Iterations Count: PBKDF2, which is often used in conjunction with the PBEKeySpec class, is used to generate the password-based key. This PBKDF2 algorithm provides an option for specifying the number of iterations used in the key generation process. In this code, a number of 11010 iterations are specified, which is far less than the recommended value of at least 10000. This is insecure because it weakens the security provided by the password-based key.

3. Insecure Salt: The salt used is an array of 16 bytes, which is considered secure for many purposes. However, for cryptographic purposes, a salt of at least the same length as the hash output (in bytes) is highly recommended. A salt of 16 bytes can be insecure, which reduces the security of the hashed password.

4. Inadequate Encryption Strength: The key length is specified as 16 bits. This is not secure, as this can be easily cracked with modern powerful computers and resources. 

Here is the code snippet you should fix:

```java
public class Pd {
    private PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = null;
    private PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;

    public static void main(String [] args){
        Pd ckp = new Pd();
        ckp.key();
    }
    public void key() {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        String password = "Some Strong Password";
        byte [] salt = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        int iterationCount = 10000;
        int keyLength = 128;
        pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);
    }
}
```
You should replace "Some Strong Password" with a strong password and ensure that the iteration count is greater than or equal to 10000 and the key length is greater than or equal to 128 bits.
