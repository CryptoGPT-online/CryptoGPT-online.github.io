The code is using the PBEKeySpec class, which is a specification for a secret key, suitable for password-based encryption, and PBEParameterSpec, which is a parameter specification for password-based encryption. 

The misuses found in the code are:

1. Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:

The code is using PBE (Password Based Encryption) algorithm, which is not recommended for new systems because it has various flaws.

2. Improper Certificate Validation:

In this code, there is no certificate validation. It means there is no validation of the certificate from which the encrypted data is derived.

3. Use of Insufficiently Random Values:

The code uses a hard-coded iteration count which is less than recommended by the NIST (10000). The code also uses a hard-coded salt.

4. Inadequate Encryption Strength:

The code uses a hard-coded key length of 16 which is insecure.
