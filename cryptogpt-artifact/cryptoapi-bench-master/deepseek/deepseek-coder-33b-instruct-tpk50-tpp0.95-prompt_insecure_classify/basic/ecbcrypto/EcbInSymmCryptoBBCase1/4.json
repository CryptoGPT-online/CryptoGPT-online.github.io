Misuse of cryptographic API:

```json
[{
  "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
  "description": "The code uses AES algorithm for key generation. AES algorithm provides a symmetric cryptography, which means the same key is used for encryption and decryption. This key generation process generates a 128-bit (16 byte) key. Due to its simplicity, AES keys of 128 bits are considered too short and less secure than other forms of encryption.",
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a more secure encryption algorithm such as RSA with a key size of 2048 bits or higher. Also, if you use AES, make sure your keys are generated with a sufficient size, such as 256 bits."
