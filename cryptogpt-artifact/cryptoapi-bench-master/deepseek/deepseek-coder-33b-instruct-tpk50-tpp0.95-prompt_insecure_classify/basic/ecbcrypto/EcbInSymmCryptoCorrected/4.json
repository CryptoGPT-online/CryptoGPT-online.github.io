The code provided uses the AES symmetric encryption algorithm in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with PKCS5 padding, which is a commonly used combination of algorithms. However, it has a few security flaws:

1. The use of AES in CBC mode is problematic, as it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. This means an attacker can manipulate the ciphertext and decrypt it to obtain the plaintext.
2. In CBC mode, the IV (Initialization Vector) is not generated securely, which can lead to predictable encryption results and make the encryption itself susceptible to attacks.

Here is a recommended modification to secure the code:

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.NoSuchProviderException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class SecureCrypto {
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, NoSuchProviderException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(256, SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()); // Use a secure random number generator
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        byte[] iv = new byte[16];
        new SecureRandom().nextBytes(iv); // Generate a random IV
        IvParameterSpec ivParameterSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivParameterSpec);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, NoSuchProviderException {
        SecureCrypto sc = new SecureCrypto();
        sc.go();
    }
}
```

In this code, we use a secure random number generator to generate the AES key. Also, we generate a random IV for the CBC mode of operation. This way, even if an attacker can manipulate the ciphertext and decrypt it, they won't be able to use the same IV for future decryption, and the result will be unpredictable. 

Please note that this code does not solve all cryptographic problems in your code. You should also consider other security concerns like the use of encryption algorithms, properly manage and store keys, use secure random numbers, protect against timing attacks, and always use the latest security protocols.
