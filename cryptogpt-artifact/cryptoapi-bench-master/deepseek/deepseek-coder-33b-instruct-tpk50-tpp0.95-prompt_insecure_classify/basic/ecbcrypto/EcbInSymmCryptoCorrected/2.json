The code provided has several weaknesses related to the usage of cryptographic primitives. Here they are:

1. Inadequate Entropy Source. The 'KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")' may not use a good source of entropy for the key generation. This can lead to weaker security.

2. Static Initialization Vector (IV). The 'Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")' does not use an IV. In CBC mode, an IV should be randomly chosen for each encryption operation and should not be reused.

3. Weak Cipher Mode. The cipher mode chosen is CBC which is vulnerable to attacks like "chosen-plaintext attack" or "related-key attacks". It is recommended to use AES in CTR mode instead, which is not susceptible to these attacks.

Here is the modified version of the code:

```java
public class Ed {
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        // Add SecureRandom with strong randomness
        keyGen.init(256, new SecureRandom());
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CTR/NoPadding");
        // Generate IV with secure randomness
        byte[] iv = new byte[cipher.getBlockSize()];
        SecureRandom randomSecureRandom = new SecureRandom();
        randomSecureRandom.nextBytes(iv);
        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, InvalidKeyException {
        Ed bc = new Ed();
        bc.go();
    }
}
```

This code corrects the issues mentioned above by using 'KeyGenerator.init(256, new SecureRandom())' to use a strong random number generator, 'Cipher.getInstance("AES/CTR/NoPadding")' to use a better cipher mode that is not susceptible to the CBC mode's weaknesses, and 'SecureRandom()' to generate an IV.
