        "vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();",
        "description": "The default constructor of Random class is usually not used in practice. If multiple instances of Random class are created within a short period of time, they may generate identical sequences of 'pseudorandom' numbers. This may not be secure in certain cases, e.g. in generating session tokens or generating user passwords.",
        "recommendation": "In order to generate secure random numbers, you should usually specify a seed value. A good source of entropy for the seed is SecureRandom. Also, if you are generating session tokens or user passwords, don't rely on the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) provided by java.security.SecureRandom, as it is possible to predict the next number in the sequence."
