This code doesn't have any Crypto API misuse as per your mentioned categories. It is not using any insecure crypto API or algorithm. It's using the `SecureRandom` class correctly. This class generates secure random numbers. The `nextInt()` method generates a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between the minimum and maximum int values (`Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`). The class `SecureRandom` extends `java.util.Random` and provides a cryptographically strong random number generator.
