    "description": "This custom trust manager does not perform any certificate verification. It is accepting all certificates regardless of their trust or validity.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are implemented to validate the certificates and establish a secure connection."
