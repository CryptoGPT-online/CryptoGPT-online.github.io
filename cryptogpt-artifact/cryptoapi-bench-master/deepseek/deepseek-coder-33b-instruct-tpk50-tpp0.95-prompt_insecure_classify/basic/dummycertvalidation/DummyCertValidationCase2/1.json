  "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
  "vulnerable_code": "@Override\npublic void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {\n}",
  "description": "This method is designed to handle server-side certificate validation, but it is currently not performing any checks on the server's certificate. This poses a security risk as it allows any server-side certificate to be trusted without verification.",
  "recommendation": "Ensure that this method checks the server's certificate to ensure that it is valid. You may want to use a library such as Bouncy Castle for certificate validation."
