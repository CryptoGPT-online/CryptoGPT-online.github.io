The provided code snippet is a custom implementation of the X509TrustManager. This code does not contain any specific crypto API misuses, but it's worth noting that the 'checkClientTrusted' and 'checkServerTrusted' methods are left blank which means the trust manager will accept all certificates without any validation. This might not be secure if the server's certificate is not properly validated. 

So, if the certificate is not verified in your project, you could get a CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation misuse.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException",
        "description": "The checkServerTrusted method is left blank, which means the trust manager will accept all certificates without any validation.",
        "recommendation": "You should implement proper certificate validation. You can use the CertificateFactory and X509Certificate classes to do this."
    }
]
```
