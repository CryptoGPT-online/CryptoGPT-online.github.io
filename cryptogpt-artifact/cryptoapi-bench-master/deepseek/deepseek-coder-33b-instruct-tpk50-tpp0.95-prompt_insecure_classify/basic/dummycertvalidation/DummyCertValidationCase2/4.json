        "description": "This code does not verify if the certificate presented by the server is valid and not revoked. In a production environment, you would want to use a trust store that includes a list of trusted certificates and verify that the presented certificate is in the trust store. Additionally, the certificate should be validated by checking the validity period and the signature.",
        "recommendation": "You should validate the X509 certificate chain to ensure it is properly issued by a trusted CA and hasn't been revoked."
