There are a few problems with the provided code:

1. Passing a random generated password as the KeyStore's password: The method random.ints() generates a stream of random integers. This cannot be cast directly to a String, and may not meet the requirements for a valid KeyStore password. Moreover, it's a poor choice for a password because it's random and can't be recovered if lost.

2. Using an insecure protocol to load the KeyStore: The URL provided is "https://www.google.com", which appears to be an attempt to load a KeyStore from a website. While this might not immediately cause an exception, it's almost always a bad idea to use a website URL for loading KeyStore resources, as it's insecure and could potentially fail if the website goes down.

3. Not handling any kind of exception: The code throws multiple checked exceptions without handling them in any meaningful way. This means that any failure in KeyStore.load() could result in the program terminating abruptly. It's important to ensure that exceptions are properly caught and handled.

Here is a refactored version of your code, using a fixed password and a local file path for the KeyStore:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.KeyStore;
import java.security.KeyStoreException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.cert.CertificateException;

public class Pd {
    public static void main(String args[]) throws KeyStoreException, IOException, CertificateException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        Pd pksp = new Pd();
        pksp.go();
    }

    public void go() throws KeyStoreException, IOException, CertificateException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String type = "JKS";
        KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);

        String password = "securePassword123";
        String keyStorePath = "path_to_your_keystore_file";

        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(keyStorePath)) {
            ks.load(fis, password.toCharArray());
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("File not found: " + keyStorePath);
        } catch (IOException | KeyStoreException | NoSuchAlgorithmException | CertificateException e) {
            System.err.println("Error loading KeyStore: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Please replace `"securePassword123"` and `"path_to_your_keystore_file"` with your actual KeyStore password and file path.
