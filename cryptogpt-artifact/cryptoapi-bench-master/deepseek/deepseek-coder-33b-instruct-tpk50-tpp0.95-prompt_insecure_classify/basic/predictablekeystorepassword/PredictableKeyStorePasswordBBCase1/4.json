There are several security misuses in this code:

1. Use of Unencrypted Network Connection: The connection to "https://www.google.com" is not encrypted. This means that the communication between the client and the server is not secure.

2. Use of Default Password: The code uses a default password for the keystore, which is "changeit". This password should not be used and should be changed.

The JSON response for these misuses would be:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information",
        "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
        "description": "This code sends sensitive data in the clear over a network connection. Since the connection is not encrypted, the data could be intercepted and read.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure network connection. For example, use the 'https' protocol instead of the 'http' protocol."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password",
        "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());",
        "description": "The keystore is loaded using a hardcoded password. This is a security risk because the password could be easily discovered by anyone who can view the source code.",
        "recommendation": "Do not use hard-coded passwords. Instead, use secure methods to securely store and retrieve the password."
    }
]
