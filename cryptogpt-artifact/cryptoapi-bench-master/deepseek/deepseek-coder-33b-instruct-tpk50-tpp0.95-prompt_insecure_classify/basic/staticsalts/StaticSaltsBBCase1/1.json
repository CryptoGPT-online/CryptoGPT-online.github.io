The code you've shared does not use any cryptographic functionality. However, it is using the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) API, specifically the PBEParameterSpec class, to set up parameters for password-based encryption (PBE).

As for crypto API misuses:

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values: The code creates a salt for PBE using a static, hard-coded value. This salt is a single byte and is repeated throughout the encryption process. This lack of randomness could weaken the encryption. 

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength: The iteration count (count variable) is relatively low at 1020. This means the encryption process will be slower, which could make it easier for attackers to crack.

Here's how you could fix these issues:

1. Use SecureRandom for generating a random salt.
2. Increase the iteration count.

Here is an updated version of the code:

```java
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEParameterSpec;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class S1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        S1 cs = new S1();
        cs.key2();
    }

    public void key2(){
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] salt = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        int count = 10000; // increase iteration count
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
    }
}
```

This code will create a salt with 16 random bytes and will increase the iteration count to 10000. This will make your code more secure.
