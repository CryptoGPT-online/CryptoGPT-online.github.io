    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The iteration count in PBE (Password-Based Encryption) is set to a very low value. According to NIST SP 800-132, the minimum recommended iteration count for PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is 10,000. Using a value lower than this can make the computation of derived keys too fast, making them vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 10,000. If possible, increase it even more."
