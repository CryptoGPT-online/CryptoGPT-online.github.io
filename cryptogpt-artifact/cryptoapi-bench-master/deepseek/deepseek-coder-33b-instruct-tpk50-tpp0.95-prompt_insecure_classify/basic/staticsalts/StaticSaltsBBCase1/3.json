This code does not contain any cryptographic misuse. However, it is not directly related to the Java cryptographic API. The code generates an instance of a PBEParameterSpec, which is a parameter specification for a PBE (Password-based encryption) key specifying iteration count and salt. This is a standard and safe way to use PBEParameterSpec.

So, if your original question was about a cryptographic misuse or security flaw, it was not present in the provided code snippet. However, it's good practice to use secure iterations count for the PBEParameterSpec, typically not less than 10000.
