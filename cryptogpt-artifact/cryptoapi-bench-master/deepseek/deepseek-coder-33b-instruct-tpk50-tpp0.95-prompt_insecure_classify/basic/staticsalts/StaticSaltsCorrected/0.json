The code you provided correctly uses the PBEParameterSpec class, which is designed for password-based encryption. However, it's important to note that PBEParameterSpec does not directly handle the issue of randomness.

The SecureRandom class in the code is used to generate a secure random byte array for the salt which is indeed important for the security of the encryption.

However, the number of iterations in the PBEParameterSpec (count variable) is set as 1020. This could be a potential misuse depending on the actual use case. The number of iterations is set to 1020 which is much higher than the default value of 1000 used in practice. Setting a high number of iterations can slow down the process of password-based key derivation, thus decreasing the performance of the system.

As for the length of the salt (32 bytes in this case), it is generally recommended to use at least as large as the hash function used (SHA-256 for example requires 32 bytes, so 32 bytes would be adequate). 

Thus, there are two potential misuses in this code. First, the number of iterations (count variable) should be adjusted according to the actual needs. Second, the length of the salt (in the sample it's 32 bytes) may be increased.
