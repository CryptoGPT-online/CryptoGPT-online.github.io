Misuse: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

vulnerable_code:
```
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
```

description:
The code uses the DES algorithm, which is a 56-bit key algorithm. DES keys are often too short to provide adequate security, especially since today's modern hardware makes the strength of DES-based encryption more easily breached via brute force.

recommendation:
Consider using stronger encryption such as AES (which provides a 128-bit key), or consider using a key length of 192 or 256 bits for DES. 

Note: While DES is still useful for backwards compatibility, it's generally recommended to upgrade to AES. Java supports AES in GCM/NoPadding and CBC/PKCS5Padding modes.
