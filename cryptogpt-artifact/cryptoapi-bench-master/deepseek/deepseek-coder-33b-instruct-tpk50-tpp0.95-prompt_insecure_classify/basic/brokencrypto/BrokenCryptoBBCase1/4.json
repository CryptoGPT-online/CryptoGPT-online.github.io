The code you posted is using DES, which is a well-known and trusted cryptographic algorithm, but it's also a weak one. It's currently considered insecure and inappropriate to use it for high-security encryption. The problem lies in the key size; DES is only a 56-bit key, compared to 128-bit recommended for modern cryptographic standards.

This is how you can modify your code to use AES, which is a stronger, more secure algorithm:

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.NoSuchPaddingException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class B1 {
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(128); // You can choose the key size to be 128, 192 or 256. 
        java.security.Key key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B1 bc = new B1();
        bc.go();
    }
}
```

In this modified code, the KeyGenerator is using AES and key size is set to 128 bit which is recommended for AES. The same goes to the cipher, it's now using AES with the same key size. This is the recommended way to use AES in Java. 

Please remember to not hardcode the key, but store it securely, like using a KeyStore. And consider using modern modes of operation and/or authenticated encryption for additional security.
