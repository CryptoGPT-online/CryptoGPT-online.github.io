        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\");",
        "description": "The 'RC4' algorithm is considered cryptographically broken and risky. RC4 should not be used in modern applications due to its short key length (only 40 to 2048 bits) which makes it prone to brute-force attacks. 'RC4' is not even included in Cipher's list of supported algorithms and should not be used at all. ",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger algorithm like AES, DES, or RSA. The specific algorithms to use should be chosen in line with the security requirements of the application."
