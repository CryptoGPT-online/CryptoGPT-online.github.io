```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\")",
        "description": "The use of RC4 is discouraged due to numerous reasons, including it having been found to have vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is widely considered to be insecure and unfit for most cryptographic purposes. RC4 is also no longer supported by Java 11 or later versions.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger, more secure algorithm such as AES. If you need to use RC4 for legacy reasons, make sure to do so responsibly and in accordance with existing, trusted standards and guidelines."
