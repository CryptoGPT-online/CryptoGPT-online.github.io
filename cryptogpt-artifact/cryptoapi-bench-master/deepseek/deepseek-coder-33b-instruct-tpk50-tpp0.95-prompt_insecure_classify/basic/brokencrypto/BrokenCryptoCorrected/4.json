        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
        "description": "This code uses the 'AES' algorithm which is known to have relatively weak encryption strength. This could potentially allow attackers to decrypt the encrypted data easily.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger encryption algorithm like 'AES-256' instead of 'AES'. Alternatively, you can use 'DES' which is known for its high security."
