The code provided uses "AES" algorithm which is considered secure and should not be a problem. However, one could argue that it uses an AES key of only 128 bits which is too short for current standard. Additionally, it is recommended to use secure random for key generation in a real-world scenario.

Here's how you can modify the code to include these suggestions:

```java
public class Bd {
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        keyGen.init(256, random); // Use a secure random, and generate a 256-bit key
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        Bd bc = new Bd();
        bc.go();
    }
}
```

Note: The key size is now 256 bits, which is considered secure. The SecureRandom class is used to ensure a secure random number generator is used. The usage of a secure random in key generation is a best practice to avoid predictable keys and side-channel attacks.
