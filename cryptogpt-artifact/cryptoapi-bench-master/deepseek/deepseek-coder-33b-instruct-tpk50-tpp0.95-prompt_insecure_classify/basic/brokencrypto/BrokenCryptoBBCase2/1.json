The code provided uses Blowfish, which is considered weak and has been officially deprecated for security reasons. This is a misuse of the cryptographic API, specifically by using a weak algorithm.

The recommended cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation are:

- Symmetric algorithms:
  - AES for most situations where high security is required.
  - AES with GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) or CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) for most situations where high security is not required.

- Asymmetric algorithms:
  - RSA, with OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) for most situations where high security is required.

Here is the recommended code:

```java
public class B2 {
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B2 bc = new B2();
        bc.go();
    }
}
```
In this code, AES in GCM mode is used instead of Blowfish. This is a more secure choice.

For the recommendation, please replace "AES" and "AES/GCM/NoPadding" with the recommended algorithms based on your requirements. It's important to choose the strongest algorithms available that still meet your security needs.
