The code provided is actually using the Blowfish cipher algorithm which is considered insecure due to its short key size. The recommendation would be to use a secure algorithm with a longer key size.

Below is the JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");",
        "description": "The Blowfish cipher algorithm is insecure because its key size is only 128 bits which is considered too short.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a cipher algorithm that offers a longer key size like AES which offers 128, 192 or 256 bits key size."
    }
]
```
