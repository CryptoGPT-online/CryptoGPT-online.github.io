Here are the cryptographic API misuses in the provided code:

1. Use of insecure key sizes:
Misuse: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.
Misuse code: `int keysize = 1024;`
Description: Key size of 1024 is considered insecure due to computational limitation.
Recommendation: Use key size of 2048 or above.

2. Use of RSA algorithm:
Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
Misuse code: `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");`
Description: RSA is a secure encryption algorithm, but it's susceptible to some attacks like Bleichenbacherâ€™s RSA padding oracle attack, which can be used to decrypt encrypted messages.
Recommendation: Consider using AES with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) or Counter with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCM).

3. Use of SealedObject:
Misuse: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
Misuse code: `SealedObject encryptedMessage = new SealedObject(myMessage,cipher);`
Description: The SealedObject class depends on the security of the underlying Cipher.init method for the initialization vector (IV). If the IV is not chosen cryptographically securely, it might be possible to recover the IV and decrypt the ciphertext.
Recommendation: If the purpose is to hide sensitive data from other programs or processes, consider using different ways of obfuscation or encryption.

To fix these issues, you can replace the `KeyPairGenerator` algorithm with "RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding", as suggested in the CWE recommendation:

```java
KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
kgp.initialize(2048); // Use key size of 2048 or above
KeyPair kp = kgp.generateKeyPair();

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, kp.getPublic());
```
