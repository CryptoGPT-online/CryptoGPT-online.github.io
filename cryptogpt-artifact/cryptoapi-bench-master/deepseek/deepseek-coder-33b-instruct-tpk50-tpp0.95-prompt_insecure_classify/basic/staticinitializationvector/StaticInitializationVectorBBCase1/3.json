This code does not seem to have any immediate crypto API misuses, but there are some potential issues that could be considered when used in a real-world application:

1. Using ECB mode encryption: ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode does not provide any confidentiality as the same plaintext block will always produce the same ciphertext block. In a real-world application, this is not secure.

2. Static Iv value: The initialization vector (IV) used is static and the same for every encryption operation. This is a bad practice because it makes the encryption deterministic and vulnerable to attacks.

3. Static key: The AES key is randomly generated each time the application is run and is not stored or reused. In a real-world application, you should avoid generating keys randomly and use a secure key management system.

Here is how you could resolve these issues:

```java
public class S1 {
    private final SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();

    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(256, secureRandom);
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");

        byte[] ivBytes = new byte[16];
        secureRandom.nextBytes(ivBytes);
        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes);

        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);

        // Now encrypt data
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        S1 siv = new S1();
        siv.go();
    }
}
```

This updated code includes a 256-bit AES key, uses SecureRandom to generate a different IV each time, and uses CBC mode for encryption (which is generally considered more secure than ECB). Note that this is a simple example and doesn't address key management, which is a big concern in a real-world application. 

Always remember to use secure random generators for key and IV generation, and never use hardcoded values.
