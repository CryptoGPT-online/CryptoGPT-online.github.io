The code provided does not use a static IV for every message encryption and also the length of IV is not constant (it is always 5 bytes which is very short), which is a security flaw. This is a CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values misuse.

Here is the suggested JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes(); IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
        "description": "The IV is created with a static string which has very short length (5 bytes). This is extremely insecure because it can easily be brute-forced.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a cryptographically secure random IV. The length of the IV should match the block size of the cipher, e.g. 16 bytes for AES."
    }
]
```
