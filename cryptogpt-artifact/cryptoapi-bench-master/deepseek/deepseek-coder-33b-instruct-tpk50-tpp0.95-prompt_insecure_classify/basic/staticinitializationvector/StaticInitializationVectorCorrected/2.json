        "description": "The IV (initialization vector) used for CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode should be a random, unpredictable number. Using a deterministic random number generator (like 'SecureRandom') to generate a BigInteger and then converting this to a byte array isn't sufficient. It could be predicted by an attacker and result in weaker encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of creating a 'BigInteger', use 'SecureRandom.nextBytes()' to generate the IV. This way, a random, secure IV is generated each time."
