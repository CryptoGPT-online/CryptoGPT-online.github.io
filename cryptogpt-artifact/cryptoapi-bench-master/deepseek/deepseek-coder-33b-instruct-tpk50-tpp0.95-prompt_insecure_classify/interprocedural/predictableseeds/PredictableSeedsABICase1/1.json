Misuse: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

Misuse Code:

```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
sr.setSeed(seed);
```

Description: 

The `SecureRandom` class provides a seed which is used to initialize the generator. If a developer does not manually provide a seed, the system time and other sources may not provide a sufficiently random seed. As a result, the pseudo-random number generation may not be secure. The `setSeed(byte[])` method allows a developer to set the seed, but it can create problems for a number of reasons. 

1. If the `seed` array is not sufficiently random, then the PRNG's first few outputs will not be random, and could potentially cause predictability in the numbers that are generated. 

2. This can potentially allow an attacker to predict the numbers that will be generated and may be used to manipulate the program's behavior. 

Recommendation:

Use `SecureRandom` without setting a seed unless there is a specific reason to do so. The seed is often auto-generated by the system time, which is generally random enough.
