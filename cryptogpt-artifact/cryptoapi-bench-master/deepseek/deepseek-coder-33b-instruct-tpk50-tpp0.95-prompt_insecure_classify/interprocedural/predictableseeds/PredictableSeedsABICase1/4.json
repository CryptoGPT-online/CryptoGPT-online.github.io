There is no crypto API misuse in the provided code. It's using `SecureRandom` class correctly. However, it sets the seed using an array of bytes instead of a long. This could lead to a lesser entropy than if we use a long. As SecureRandom requires a seed, it is generally recommended to use a long. It is also important to note that using `SecureRandom` correctly requires proper initialization, and this code is doing that. 

So, based on the above analysis, there isn't any crypto API misuse in this code.
