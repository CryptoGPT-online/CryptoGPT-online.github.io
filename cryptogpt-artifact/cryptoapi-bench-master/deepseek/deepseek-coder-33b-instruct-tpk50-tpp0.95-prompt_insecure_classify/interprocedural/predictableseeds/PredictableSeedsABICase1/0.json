The code provided is using a seed for the SecureRandom generator which can lead to non-random behavior in some cases. The seed provided is a byte array, which might not always generate a truly random sequence depending on the Java version being used.

This is a misuse of the SecureRandom API, according to the CWE-330: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values." The seed is not random enough and might produce predictable results.

Recommendation:

A better approach would be to not provide a seed at all, which will cause SecureRandom to generate a seed from the system's random number generator, which should provide a higher level of randomness.

Here is the improved code:

```java
public class P1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        go();
    }
    private static void go() {
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```
