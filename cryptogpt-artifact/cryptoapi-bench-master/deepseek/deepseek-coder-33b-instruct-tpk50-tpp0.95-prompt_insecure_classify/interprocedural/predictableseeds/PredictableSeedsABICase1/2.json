The misuse type is "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values".
The misuse code snippets are: `byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};` and `sr.setSeed(seed);`
The description of the misuse is that the seed used in the SecureRandom object is not random enough, which will lead to predictable results. The seed is too short and simple, it will be easy to guess the next random values. 
The recommendation is to use a better source of entropy for the SecureRandom seed, or to increase the size of the seed to a larger random value to improve the randomness of the numbers generated by the SecureRandom. Here is the recommended code:

```
public class P1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        byte [] seed = new byte[16]; // generate a 16-byte random seed
        sr.nextBytes(seed);
        go(seed);
    }
    private static void go(byte [] seed) {
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.setSeed(seed);
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

In the above code, a 16-byte random seed is generated from a cryptographically strong random number generator (SecureRandom).
