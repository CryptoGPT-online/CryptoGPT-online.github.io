Misuse found: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

Misuse code: 
```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});
```

Description: 
The `seed` used to initialize the `SecureRandom` object is derived from `DEFAULT_SEED`, which is a constant string "100". In Java, `SecureRandom` is a cryptographically strong random number generator that is seeded from a specified byte array. The byte array provided is derived from `seed` which is initialized from `DEFAULT_SEED`. The seed "100" used is not random at all, and is easily predictable. This may not give a sufficiently random number sequence as it is too weak.

Recommendation:

To generate a secure random number in Java, a seed is typically needed to initialize `SecureRandom`. The secure random number generator can draw random bytes to seed itself. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to predict the output of the `SecureRandom` instance.

You can do this by:

```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
```

In this way, `SecureRandom` instance will be initialized with random seed and the output will be very random.
