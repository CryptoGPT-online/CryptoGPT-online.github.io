Here is the response:
[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});", "description": "In this code, it is using a byte array to generate a random seed for SecureRandom. This is a weak seed and can lead to predictable random numbers.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure seed for SecureRandom. It is better to use SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() instead of a byte array."}]
