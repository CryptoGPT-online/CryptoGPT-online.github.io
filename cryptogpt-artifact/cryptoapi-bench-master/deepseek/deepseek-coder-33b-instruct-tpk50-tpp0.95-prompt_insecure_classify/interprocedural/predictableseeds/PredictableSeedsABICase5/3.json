This code uses a byte array as a seed for the SecureRandom object. There are no direct misuses, but if this code is part of a larger system, it may be susceptible to attack.

CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values: 
The use of `byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200}` in the main method could lead to weaker randomness than a random number generator could provide. A better approach would be to use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().nextBytes(seed);` to ensure seed values are generated from a secure random number generator.

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: 
SecureRandom is a cryptographic algorithm. However, using an insecure random seed can lead to predictable results, which is not a recommended practice in cryptographic applications.
