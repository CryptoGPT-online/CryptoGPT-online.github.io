Misuse: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values. 
Misuse Code:
sr.setSeed(seed);

Description: The seed for the SecureRandom is set based on a value provided by the user. This can lead to a predictable series of numbers. This makes the random number generated less secure.

Recommendation: 
Instead of relying on the user-provided seed for a secure random generator, it's preferable to use a built-in entropy source like "/dev/urandom" or "/dev/random" to generate the seed. This ensures that the seed is random and unpredictable, enhancing the security of the random number generation.
