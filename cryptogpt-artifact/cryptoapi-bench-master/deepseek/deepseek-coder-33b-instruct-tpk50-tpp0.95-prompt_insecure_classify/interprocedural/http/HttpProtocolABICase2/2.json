There are no misuses identified in the provided code. 

The code declares two arrays: URL and url. The DEFAULT_URL is transformed into a char array and assigned to URL. The URL is later assigned to url. Finally, an attempt is made to create a new URL object using url.

It's important to note that this code is susceptible to the "Use of Hardcoded Non-cryptographic Key" security issue, which might arise if the URL is hardcoded in the code and later used as a key in cryptographic operations. But it is not related to the code snippet you provided.
