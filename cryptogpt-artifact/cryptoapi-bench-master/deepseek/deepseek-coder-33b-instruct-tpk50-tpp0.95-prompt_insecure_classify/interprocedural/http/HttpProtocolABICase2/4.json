    "vulnerable_code": "private static void go3() {\n    url = URL;\n}",
    "description": "The variable 'URL' is a static character array that holds the contents of the constant string 'DEFAULT_URL'. The 'url' variable also points to this static array. Since URL is never changed, the 'url' variable will always hold the same value. This could be a security risk if you need to use a different URL.",
    "recommendation": "If you need to change the URL at some point, consider using a mutable class or object to hold it. In this case, consider using StringBuilder instead of char array."
