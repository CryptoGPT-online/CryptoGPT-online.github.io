Misuse: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Misuse Code: Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);
Description: The key length is determined to be 16 bytes, which is not sufficient for AES encryption. AES can use 128-bit (16 bytes), 192-bit, and 256-bit keys. While the programmer might have chosen 16 bytes for simplicity, this key size is considered insufficient for AES encryption, and it can make the encrypted data vulnerable to brute force attacks.
Recommendation: The key size should be increased to 256 bits (32 bytes) for AES encryption. However, if the encryption needs are not high, it may be better to use a less secure, but faster, algorithm like DES.
