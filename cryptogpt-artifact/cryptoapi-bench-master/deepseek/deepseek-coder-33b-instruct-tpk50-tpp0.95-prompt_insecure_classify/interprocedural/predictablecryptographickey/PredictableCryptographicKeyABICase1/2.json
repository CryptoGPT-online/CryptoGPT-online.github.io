Misuses:

1. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   Misuse code snippets: SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
   Description: The code uses an insecure key length for the AES encryption algorithm. AES requires a 128, 192, or 256 bit key size, but the key provided is only 16 bytes which is too short.
   Recommendation: Use a secure key length. A 128 bit key size is a good choice.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
   Misuse code snippets: byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();
   Description: The key is created from a String using the getBytes() method which relies on the default platform encoding. This may not generate a sufficiently random key.
   Recommendation: Use a secure random number generator to generate the key.

As a JSON response, this would look like:
