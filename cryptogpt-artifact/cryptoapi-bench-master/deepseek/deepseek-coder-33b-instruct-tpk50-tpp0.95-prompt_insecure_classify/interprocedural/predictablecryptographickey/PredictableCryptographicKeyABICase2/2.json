There are several issues with this code:

1. The encryption key is hardcoded and not encrypted, which is not secure.
2. The key used for encryption is always the same, which is insecure.
3. The key is converted to bytes, and then copied to a fixed size of 16 bytes. If the key is less than 16 bytes, the remaining bytes will be zero. This is not secure, because it can lead to predictable encryption.
4. The key is converted to a string using `toString()`, which may not work as expected.

Here's a corrected version:

```java
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class P2 {
    private static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = "defaultkey";
    private static char[] ENCRYPT_KEY;
    private static char[] encryptKey;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        go2();
        go3();
        go();
    }

    private static void go2() {
        ENCRYPT_KEY = DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY.toCharArray();
    }

    private static void go3() {
        encryptKey = ENCRYPT_KEY;
    }

    private static void go() {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] keyBytes = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(keyBytes);
        SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
    }
}
```

This version of the code generates a random encryption key of size 16 bytes each time the `go()` method is called.
