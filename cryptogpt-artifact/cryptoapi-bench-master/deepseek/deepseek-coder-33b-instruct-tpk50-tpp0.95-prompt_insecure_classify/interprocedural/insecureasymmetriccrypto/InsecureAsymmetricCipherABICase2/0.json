The misuse in this code is that the RSA key size is not set to a sufficiently large value. The default key size for RSA is 2048 bits. Using a key size of 1024 bits is considered insecure due to the risk of the RSA algorithm being broken with currently available computational power. 

Here is the JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "KEY_SIZE = 1024;",
        "description": "The RSA key size is set to a very small value of 1024 bits which is considered insecure due to the risk of the RSA algorithm being broken with currently available computational power.",
        "recommendation": "Use a sufficiently large key size, such as 2048 bits or more, for RSA encryption. It's recommended to use a multiple of 1024 for better security."
    }
