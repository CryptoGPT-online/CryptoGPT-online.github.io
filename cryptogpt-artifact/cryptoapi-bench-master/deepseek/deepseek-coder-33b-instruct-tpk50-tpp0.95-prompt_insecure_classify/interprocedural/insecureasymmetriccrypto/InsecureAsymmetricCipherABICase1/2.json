The provided code has several issues related to cryptography. The main issue is related to the use of the RSA algorithm. RSA is a public-key cryptosystem and is generally considered secure for most applications. However, the code uses RSA for both encryption and decryption of the message. This is known as "symmetric" encryption, but it is not necessary to encrypt the message with the same key you are going to use to decrypt it. As a result, the code can be rewritten to use RSA for encryption only, as RSA is a public-key algorithm.

The other issue is the use of a small key size (1024 bits) for RSA. The key size is generally recommended to be at least 2048 bits for security purposes. Using a smaller key size can make the system vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

Here is the rewritten code:

```java
public class I1 {
    public void go(int keySize) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, IOException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException, ClassNotFoundException {
        KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
        kgp.initialize(keySize);
        KeyPair kp = kgp.generateKeyPair();

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, kp.getPublic());

        //encrypting
        String myMessage = new String("Secret Message");
        byte[] encryptedMessage = cipher.doFinal(myMessage.getBytes());

        //decrypting
        Cipher dec = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
        dec.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, kp.getPrivate());

        byte[] decryptedMessage = dec.doFinal(encryptedMessage);
        String message = new String(decryptedMessage);
        System.out.println(message);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, IOException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException, ClassNotFoundException {
        I1 bc = new I1();

        int keySize = 2048;
        bc.go(keySize);
    }
}
```

In the rewritten code, I've used the `doFinal()` method to encrypt and decrypt the message, as the `SealedObject` class is not needed for this use case. 

The key size has been increased to 2048, as this is generally considered a good practice for public-key cryptography.

Note: This is a simple example for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, it's recommended to use a more secure encryption mechanism.
