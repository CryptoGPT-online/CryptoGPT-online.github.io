There is a CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm misuse in your code.

{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\"); \n kgp.initialize(keySize);",
  "description": "The RSA algorithm is considered as a weak algorithm because it is used in this code and key size is less than 2048. The key size less than 2048 bits is considered as too small.",
  "recommendation": "Increase the key size to 2048 bits or more. It is also recommended to use stronger algorithms like AES or ECC."
