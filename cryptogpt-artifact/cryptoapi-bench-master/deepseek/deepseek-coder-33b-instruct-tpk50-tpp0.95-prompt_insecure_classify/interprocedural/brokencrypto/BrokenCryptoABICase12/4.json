The code you provided does not contain any insecure use of the Crypto API per se, but the method2 function accepts a string argument to determine the encryption algorithm used. This could potentially lead to a misuse, as it means any string could be passed to the method and used as a cryptographic algorithm, potentially introducing security vulnerabilities.

Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

Vulnerable Code: method2(String c) and method1(String crypto)

Description: The method accepts a string parameter that determines the encryption algorithm. This provides a potential to use any algorithm available in Java. However, not all algorithms are secure or are recommended.

Recommendation: Ensure that only secure and trusted encryption algorithms are used. These algorithms should also be updated regularly to mitigate vulnerabilities in older algorithms.

In addition to this, you should take a look at the JCA (Java Cryptography Architecture) provider. It is the default provider in most cases. However, it has known vulnerabilities. If you can, it is recommended to use Bouncy Castle instead.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```java
import javax.crypto.*;
import java.security.*;

public class B2 {
    private static final SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    private static final String algorithm = "Blowfish";

    public static void method2() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(algorithm, "BC");
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm, "BC");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, secureRandom);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        method2();
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, I have replaced the string arguments with a constant and explicitly use Bouncy Castle as the provider. I also added a SecureRandom to the Cipher.init method to generate a key in a secure manner.
