Based on the code you've provided, here are the misuses:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
   ```java
   private static void go2(){
       CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
   }
   private static void go3(){
       crypto = CRYPTO;
   }
   ```
   The two methods `go2()` and `go3()` are converting the constant `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` to a char array and storing it in `CRYPTO` and `crypto` respectively. This might be used later in `go()` method for getting an instance of `KeyGenerator` and `Cipher`. The problem is that `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` is set to "RC4", which is not considered safe for encryption.

2. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
   In this context, there is no actual cryptographic operation being performed, but the code is using "RC4" as the cipher algorithm. It's important to understand that Java's default policy for SSL/TLS connections disallows the use of "RC4" due to its weaknesses, so using "RC4" might not work as intended. It's recommended to use a safer encryption algorithm like "AES" instead.

Here's the JSON response:
