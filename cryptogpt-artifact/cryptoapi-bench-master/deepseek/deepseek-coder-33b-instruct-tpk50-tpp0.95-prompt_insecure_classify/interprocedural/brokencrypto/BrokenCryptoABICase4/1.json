        "description": "The crypto parameter can be user controlled. It is used to specify the crypto algorithm for encryption and decryption. The provided code uses the user input to specify the algorithm, which can allow an attacker to use a less secure algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the crypto algorithm is properly defined and controlled. Do not let user input determine the crypto algorithm."

        "description": "The KeyGenerator generates keys using a less secure PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator) which may not provide a high level of entropy.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger source of randomness for the key generation, or use a key derivation function to generate the key."
