Yes, the code is misusing cryptographic API. The problematic code segment is:
```java
public class B8 {
    ...
    public void go() throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }
    ...
}
```
Here, `crypto` is a variable that could be null because it is not initialized anywhere. The `KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))` and `Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))` methods take a string as an argument that specifies the algorithm name. When `crypto` is null, this will cause a NullPointerException.

Also, the use of the static variable `crypto` and its initialization in `go3()` method, with the value retrieved from `go2()` method which in turn gets its value from the `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` static variable, might lead to potential concurrency problems. The static keyword in Java implies shared variables and it might lead to race conditions in multi-threaded situations.

The misuse of cryptographic API and potential concurrency problems are classified under the following CWE issues:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The use of the cryptographic algorithm is not suitable for the current use case due to lack of understanding and proper analysis of the cryptographic algorithm's potential risks.

2. CWE-377: Inadequate Protection of Cryptographic Key: The cryptographic key is not adequately protected due to its use in static storage and static methods. The use of static variables might cause race conditions in multi-threaded situations.
