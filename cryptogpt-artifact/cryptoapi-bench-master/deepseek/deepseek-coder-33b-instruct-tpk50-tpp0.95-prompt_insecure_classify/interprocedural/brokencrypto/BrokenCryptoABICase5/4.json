This code seems to have several potential security misuses. Below are the findings:

1. The code is using a statically configured cipher. This can lead to issues when the cipher is outdated, not secure or does not meet your organization's standards.

Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
Misuse Code: `Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))`
Description: This code is using the cipher DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding which is outdated and not considered secure. It is considered weak for modern applications and may be vulnerable to attacks.
Recommendation: Use a secure cipher like AES for symmetric encryption, or RSA for asymmetric encryption. Always choose ciphers that are current and considered secure.

2. The code is storing the cipher in a static variable which can lead to thread safety issues.

Misuse: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization.
Misuse Code: Static variables `CRYPTO`, `CRYPTO_ALGO`, `crypto` and `crypto_algo` are shared across multiple methods and objects.
Description: This might lead to race conditions where the value of a variable can change unexpectedly and in an inconsistent manner.
Recommendation: If shared variables are required, ensure that proper synchronization mechanisms are used to avoid race conditions and make sure the usage is thread-safe.

3. No encryption key management is being done in the code.

Misuse: CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key.
Misuse Code: No explicit cryptographic key is used. The key is generated in `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto_algo));`
Description: If a hard-coded key is used, it might be discovered easily and could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
Recommendation: Avoid using hard-coded cryptographic keys. Instead, consider using a secure key management system, such as a key store.

Please note that these are potential security issues based on the code you provided and may not necessarily indicate a vulnerability in your application. It's recommended to conduct further security testing to identify any other potential issues.
