The provided Java code presents several cryptography misuses.

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "description": "The DES algorithm is a broken or weak cipher and is not suitable for any real-world use. The DES algorithm was officially deprecated in 2005 and was broken six months later. It's recommended to use a stronger cipher like AES.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'DES' with 'AES' or a stronger cipher algorithm."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto_algo))",
    "description": "The KeyGenerator class is used with a hardcoded, predictable algorithm. The DES algorithm in particular is known to be insecure. It's crucial to use a secure, random, long key for encryption. The length of the key determines the security level of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Switch to a random, long key generation method or use a secure cryptographic algorithm like AES that is currently secure."
  }
