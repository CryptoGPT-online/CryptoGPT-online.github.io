The misuses in the provided code are as follows:

1. The method `KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))` is using a non-constant algorithm. This makes the code vulnerable to CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. The algorithm used may not be strong enough to protect sensitive data and might be vulnerable to attacks.

2. The same problem exists in `Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))`. It might result in poor encryption standards, CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.

3. There is no encryption key generation method called directly in the code.

4. In addition to this, the cryptographic operations are in plaintext mode. It means the encryption key and initialization vector (IV) aren't being adequately protected, which could lead to CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

The recommended fixes are to use a strong, recommended cryptographic algorithm. Additionally, ensure encryption keys and IVs are generated and protected adequately to prevent information leakage and vulnerability to attacks.
