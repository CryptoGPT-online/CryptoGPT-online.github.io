The misuses in the code are as follows:

1. **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.**
   - Misuse:
     Use of IDEA, which is a weak cryptographic algorithm.
   - Vulnerable Code:
     ```
     KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
     Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
     ```
   - Description:
     IDEA is an encryption algorithm that is considered weak and shouldn't be used for encryption in applications where data security is important.
   - Recommendation:
     You should consider using more secure algorithms like AES, ChaCha20-Poly1305, or RSA.

2. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.**
   - Misuse:
     Use of fixed initialization vectors with the Cipher class, which may lead to security vulnerabilities.
   - Vulnerable Code:
     ```
     cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
     ```
   - Description:
     If the same key is used to encrypt multiple messages with the same initialization vector, then it can be possible to determine the key via some cryptanalysis.
   - Recommendation:
     For each encryption operation, always generate a new key, and ensure to use a random initialization vector.

The usage of `char[]` arrays to store crypto information may seem fine, but it is generally not recommended. This is due to several security reasons including possible buffer overflow problems and making it vulnerable to memory attacks. 

This code also doesn't handle `InvalidKeyException` and `NoSuchAlgorithmException` which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code. The code should ensure to handle these exceptions in a way that makes sense for your application.
