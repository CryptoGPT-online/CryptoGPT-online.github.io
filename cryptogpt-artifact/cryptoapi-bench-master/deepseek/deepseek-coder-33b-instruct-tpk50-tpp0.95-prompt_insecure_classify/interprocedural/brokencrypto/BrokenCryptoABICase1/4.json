The provided code is misusing the cryptographic algorithm and key generation. 

The algorithm "DES" is a weak encryption algorithm that uses a 56-bit key, which is considered insecure for modern applications. It is recommended to use stronger algorithms like "AES" with a minimum key size of 128 bits. 

Additionally, the "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding" is also considered weak due to the use of ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which doesn't provide any security against repeated plaintext attacks. It is recommended to use a stronger mode like "CBC" (Cipher Block Chaining). 

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.NoSuchPaddingException;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

public class B1 {
    public void go(String crypto, String keyAlgo, int keySize) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(keyAlgo);
        keyGen.init(keySize);
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B1 bc = new B1();
        String crypto = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding";
        String keyAlgo = "AES";
        int keySize = 128;
        bc.go(crypto,keyAlgo, keySize);
    }
}
```
