The provided code is vulnerable to the following issues:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. The function method1 is using the user provided input 'crypto' to instantiate a Cipher object. In this case, 'crypto' is passed as "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding". This is a risky choice for multiple reasons: DES is considered a weak cryptographic algorithm that has been broken. Moreover, ECB (Electronic Codebook) is also not a secure mode of operation.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength. The code is using a static key "DES" which is too short. While it depends on the specific application, typically 128-bit (16 bytes) keys are considered secure for most symmetric encryption schemes such as DES.

The issues above can lead to serious security vulnerabilities. For instance, it would be trivial for an attacker to brute force the encryption if the key is not long enough. And the use of DES/ECB is even worse, as ECB is not secure for most real-world applications.

The following is a JSON response to the misuses found in the code:
