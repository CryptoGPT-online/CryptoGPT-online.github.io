The code provided is highly insecure and has a couple of significant misuses of Java's crypto API:

1. KeyGenerator is used to create a SecretKey from cryptoKey which is essentially a string containing the cryptographic algorithm to be used.
2. The Cipher instance is created using the crypto string, which represents a cipher suite, which is composed of cryptographic algorithm name, mode, and padding scheme. This could lead to the usage of insecure/weak cryptographic algorithms.

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(cryptoKey);
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
```

The recommended approach would be to use a supported cryptographic algorithm (like AES) for generating the KeyGenerator and SecretKey. 

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
```

Similarly, you should use a cipher suite comprised of a supported cryptographic algorithm (like AES), a supported mode (like CBC for Cipher Block Chaining), and a supported padding scheme.

```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
```

The misuse of Java's crypto API in your provided code could lead to the usage of insecure/weak cryptographic algorithms, thus introducing potential vulnerabilities in your application's security.
