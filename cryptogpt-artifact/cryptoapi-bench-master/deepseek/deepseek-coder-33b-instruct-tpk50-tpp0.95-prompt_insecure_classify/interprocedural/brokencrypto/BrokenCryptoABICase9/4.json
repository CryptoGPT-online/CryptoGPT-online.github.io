The code you provided uses the IDEA algorithm to generate a key and encrypt a message. 

IDEA is an older algorithm that isn't recommended for secure encryption anymore because it is insecure. 

Here are two recommended methods:
1. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): It is a symmetric block cipher that can handle 128, 192, and 256 bit key sizes. It is widely considered secure and efficient, and is used in many applications.
2. RSA: It is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses pairs of keys. The public key is used for encryption and the private key for decryption. It is very secure and widely used for secure data transmission.

Here is the modification of your code using AES:
```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.NoSuchPaddingException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

public class B9 {
    public void go(String crypto) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
        javax.crypto.SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B9 bc = new B9();
        String crypto = "AES";
        bc.go(crypto);
    }
}
```
