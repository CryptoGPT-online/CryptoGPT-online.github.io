There is a misuse of crypto API in this code snippet and it's classified into CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

```java
public class B5 {
    public static void method2(String c) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        String cryptoAlgo = c;
        method1(cryptoAlgo);
    }
    public static void method1(String crypto) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {

        String crypto = "IDEA";
        method2(crypto);
    }
}
```

The code above is using "IDEA" as a crypto algorithm, which is a relatively weak and obsolete cipher. IDEA was developed back in the late 1990s and it's been known to have several security issues. It's recommended to use more modern and secure cryptographic algorithms such as AES.

The JSON response:
