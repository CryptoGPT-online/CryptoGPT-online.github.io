Here are the crypto API misuses identified in the code. 

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)));",
        "description": "The PBE algorithm is used with a non-standard iteration count. This could allow attackers to crack the password more easily.",
        "recommendation": "It's recommended to use a standard iteration count for PBE algorithm. For example, a count of 10000 is widely accepted as secure."
    }
