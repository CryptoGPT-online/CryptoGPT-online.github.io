CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

In your code, the salt is generated from a non-secure random generator. This can make the salt less random, which could potentially affect the strength of the generated password hash. 

```
byte[] salt = new byte[32];
random.nextBytes(salt);
```

Here's how you can fix it:

```java
public static void method1(int count, SecureRandom random, PBEParameterSpec pbe) {
    byte[] salt = new byte[32];
    SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    secureRandom.nextBytes(salt);

    pbe = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
}
```

Here, instead of using a normal random generator, a secure one is used to generate the salt.

```json
