The code you provided is using a static IV (Initialization Vector), which is an insecure practice. IV should never be reused with the same key, because it increases the risk of replay attacks and data exposure.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
    "description": "The IV is derived from an input that was generated from user input (bytes), which makes the IV relatively predictable. This can increase the risk of data exposure if an attacker can somehow learn the IV.",
    "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated IV every time you encrypt data. The use of SecureRandom can be used to generate the IV."
}]
```
