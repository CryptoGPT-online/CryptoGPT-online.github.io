The code you provided has several cryptographic misuses:

1. Weak IV (Initialization Vector): The IV is generated from an input that isn't random. The IV does not need to be kept secret, but it must be random and unpredictable, i.e., it must not be reused with the same key. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.

2. Static or Hardcoded Key: The `KeyGenerator` instance generates a new random key every time it is invoked, which means the key will be different every time the code is run. Storing or reusing these keys can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

3. Using a Weak Cipher Mode: The `Cipher` instance is initialized with AES in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, which is generally fine for most applications, but the use of static or hardcoded IVs can make it as weak as other non-random keys.

4. Weak Key Length: The AES key size is a compromise between security and performance. The key is generated using AES-128, which is smaller than recommended.

Here is how to fix the issues:

1. Use a SecureRandom to generate the IV and the Key.
2. Store the keys securely and reuse them as needed.
3. Use a stronger cipher mode, like GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), which is safer and more secure than CBC.
4. Use a key size recommended by the security standard, like 256 bits for AES.

Here is a modified version of your code:

```java
import javax.crypto.*;
import java.security.*;

public class S1 {
    private final SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    private final KeyGenerator keyGen;

    public S1() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        this.keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        this.keyGen.init(256, this.secureRandom); // generate a 256-bit AES key
    }

    public void go() throws InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        byte[] ivBytes = new byte[16]; // 128 bits
        this.secureRandom.nextBytes(ivBytes);
        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(ivBytes);

        SecretKey key = this.keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        S1 siv = new S1();
        siv.go();
    }
}
```

This code generates a random IV, a random AES key of size 256 bits, and uses GCM mode. It is more secure than the original code.

Please remember, you should store these keys safely and not regenerate them every time you run your program. You should also handle the keys securely to prevent unauthorized access.
