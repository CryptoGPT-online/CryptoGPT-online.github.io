The code you have provided seems to use Java's cryptographic APIs correctly for generating an AES key and an initialization vector (IV). However, there are a few issues that you should be aware of:

1. The use of hardcoded IV (`IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);`). This is a bad practice because the same IV should not be used more than once under the same key.

2. The IV length should be a random value of the same size as the block size (128 bits for AES).

3. The use of ECB mode is considered risky. It's known to be less secure than CBC mode because it lacks diffusion. It should be replaced with a safer mode.

4. The usage of hardcoded password (`KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");`). Instead of a hardcoded password, it's better to use a secure random generated password.

5. There is no padding, and the plaintext is not properly padded before encryption. This could lead to a padding oracle attack.

To improve the code, consider:

- Generating a random key and IV.
- Using a different mode than ECB for encryption.
- Properly padding and unpadding the plaintext before encryption and after decryption.

Here is the improved code:

```java
import javax.crypto.*;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import java.security.*;
import java.util.Base64;

public class S1 {
    public void go(byte[] bytes) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(256);
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        byte[] iv = new byte[16];
        new SecureRandom().nextBytes(iv);
        IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ivSpec);
        byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(bytes);
        System.out.println(Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherText));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
        S1 siv = new S1();
        byte[] bytes = "abcde".getBytes();
        siv.go(bytes);
    }
}
```

This code generates a random AES key and a random IV, and uses CBC mode which is more secure than ECB mode. The plaintext is properly padded before encryption.
