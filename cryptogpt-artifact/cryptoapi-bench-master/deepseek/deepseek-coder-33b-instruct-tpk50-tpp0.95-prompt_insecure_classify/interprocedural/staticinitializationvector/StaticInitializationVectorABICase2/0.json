The code is insecure because it uses hardcoded initialization vectors (IVs) for AES encryption, which is a cryptographic misuse. This is a CWE-330 vulnerability. The IV should never be reused under any circumstances, especially not with the same key. It would allow an attacker to decrypt the data if the same plaintext was encrypted twice with the same key and IV.

In addition, there's a misuse of an AES algorithm (CWE-327). The size of the AES key should be 128, 192, or 256 bits, which are the recommended sizes by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). If the key is smaller than this, it's less secure. However, the problem in this case seems to be more related to the IV misuse, not the key size.
