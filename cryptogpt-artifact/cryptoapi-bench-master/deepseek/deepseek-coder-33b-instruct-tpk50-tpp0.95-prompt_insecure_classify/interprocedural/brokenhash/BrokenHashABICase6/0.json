    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The use of the cryptographic algorithm MD5 is insecure. It is known to be susceptible to several attacks, including collisions and pre-image attacks. It is recommended to use stronger cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3. Note that changing the default crypto algorithm should be done with caution, as it may lead to security issues if not handled correctly.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the cryptographic algorithm with a stronger one like SHA-256 or SHA-3. Please, be aware of this change because using an insecure cryptographic algorithm can lead to security issues."
