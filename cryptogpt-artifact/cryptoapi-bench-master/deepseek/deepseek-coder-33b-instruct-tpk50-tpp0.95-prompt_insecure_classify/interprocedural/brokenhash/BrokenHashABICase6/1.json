The provided code is not directly vulnerable but there is a potential misuse in cryptographic practices:

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

Misuse Code Snippet:
```
private static void go3(){
    crypto = CRYPTO;
}

public static void go (String str) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
    md.update(str.getBytes());
    System.out.println(md.digest());
}
```

Description:
In this piece of code, `crypto` variable is assigned the `CRYPTO` char array. Both `CRYPTO` and `crypto` refer to the same array. Afterward, `crypto` is used in `MessageDigest.getInstance()`, which may lead to unexpected results or errors as the algorithm is not recognized properly. In this case, `crypto` is equal to "M","D","5", which is not a valid message digest algorithm.

Recommendation:
To fix this misuse, a new array should be created for `crypto` and it should be filled with the same elements as `CRYPTO`. You should also check the validity of the cryptographic algorithm before using it. For instance:

```
private static void go3(){
    crypto = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
}

public static void go (String str) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    String algorithm = new String(crypto);
    if(Arrays.asList(Security.getAlgorithms("MessageDigest")).contains(algorithm)){
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(algorithm);
        md.update(str.getBytes());
        System.out.println(md.digest());
    }
}
```

In this updated code, `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` is used directly in `MessageDigest.getInstance()`, ensuring that a valid cryptographic algorithm is used. The validity of the algorithm is checked using `Security.getAlgorithms("MessageDigest")` which provides a list of all valid message digest algorithms.
