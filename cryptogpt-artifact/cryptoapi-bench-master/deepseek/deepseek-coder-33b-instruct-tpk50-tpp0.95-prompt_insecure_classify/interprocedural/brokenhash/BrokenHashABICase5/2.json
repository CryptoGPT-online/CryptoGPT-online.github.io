The misuse in the code is:

```java
private static void go2(){
    CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
}
private static void go3(){
    crypto = CRYPTO;
}
```

Misuse Type: `CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm`

Vulnerable Code Snippet:

```java
private static void go2(){
    CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
}
private static void go3(){
    crypto = CRYPTO;
}
```

Description:

In the provided code, the cryptographic algorithm used is hard-coded to "SHA1". However, SHA-1 is now considered a broken and vulnerable cryptographic algorithm due to known vulnerabilities (collision, pre-image resistance attacks, etc.) and it's no longer recommended for secure hash computation.

Recommendation:

Instead of using SHA-1, it is recommended to use a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256, SHA-3, or even better - the SHA3-256 algorithm with the JCA built-in provider. 

This change should be done by replacing the string "SHA1" with "SHA-256" or another secure cryptographic algorithm in the `go()` method and `go2()` method.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
private static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = "SHA-256";
private static char[] CRYPTO;
private static char[] crypto;
public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    String str = "abcdef";
    go2();
    go3();
    go(str);
}

private static void go2(){
    CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
}
private static void go3(){
    crypto = CRYPTO;
}

public static void go (String str) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
    md.update(str.getBytes());
    System.out.println(md.digest());
}
```
