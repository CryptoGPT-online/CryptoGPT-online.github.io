Misuse type: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
Vulnerable code: MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
Description: The code is using "SHA1" algorithm for cryptographic operations which is considered weak by the industry.
Recommendation: Consider using stronger algorithms such as "SHA-256", "SHA-384" or "SHA-512" to protect against potential future cryptographic attacks.
