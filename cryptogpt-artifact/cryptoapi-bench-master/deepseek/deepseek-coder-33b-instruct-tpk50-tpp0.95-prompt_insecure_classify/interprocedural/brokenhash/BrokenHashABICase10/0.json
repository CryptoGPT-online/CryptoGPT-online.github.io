The code provided uses the MD5 cryptographic algorithm, which is considered weak and broken, leading to the recommendation to use a stronger algorithm. Furthermore, it is using a cryptographic algorithm which is already considered to be obsolete, such as MD5, for hashing. MD5 is a 128 bit hash, which is deemed to be cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use. This is a serious misuse of cryptography.

Here is the JSON response:
