Misuses:

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
Misuse Code: "String crypto = "MD5";"
Description: The MD5 algorithm is broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes anymore. It can be exploited easily.
Recommendation: Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256.

CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
Misuse Code: None directly visible but related to hash algorithms.
Description: The usage of cryptographic functions may rely on the system's current time or other values that could be guessed or generated predictably. 
Recommendation: Avoid using the system's time or other easily guessed values as part of generating or verifying a hash. If possible, use algorithms which inherently generate random data.

CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.
Misuse Code: None directly visible but related to hash algorithms.
Description: Negotiation may involve selecting the most secure algorithm, but it might not always be correctly implemented. 
Recommendation: Ensure that all cryptographic algorithms are correctly negotiated and selected during secure communication protocols.
