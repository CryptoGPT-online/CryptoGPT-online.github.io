The code you've provided does not contain any cryptography misuse, but there are misuse categories that may apply due to the way the code is structured.

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"MD4\";",
        "description": "The cryptographic hash algorithm MD4 is known to have collisions and should not be used anymore due to these concerns. ",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The MessageDigest.getInstance() function is taking a crypto algorithm name as input. This algorithm might not be the most secure and efficient one, which could lead to decreased security and performance.",
        "recommendation": "Make sure that the cryptographic algorithm chosen is secure and efficient. For instance, you could choose one of the hash functions defined in the Secure Hash Algorithm Standard (SHA-2)."
    }
