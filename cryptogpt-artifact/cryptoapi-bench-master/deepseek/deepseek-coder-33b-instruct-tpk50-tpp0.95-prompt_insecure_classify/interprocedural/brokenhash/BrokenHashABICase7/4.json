The provided code is vulnerable to multiple types of security misuses:

Misuse 1: 

```java
private static void go2(){
    CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();
}
```

Description: It is storing the default cryptographic algorithm name in a char array. This may expose the code to potential injection attacks as attackers can manipulate the algorithm name to execute their own commands or access unauthorized information.

Recommendation: Avoid storing sensitive data like cryptographic algorithm names in plain text. Instead, use a configuration file or a secure key-value store to store this sensitive data.

Misuse 2:

```java
private static void go3(){
    crypto = CRYPTO;
}
```

Description: It is copying the reference of the `CRYPTO` char array to the `crypto` char array. This could lead to potential modifications to the crypto array in one place changing the algorithm used in other places.

Recommendation: Rather than copying the reference, clone the `CRYPTO` array and store it in `crypto`. This way, alterations to one array won't affect the other.

Misuse 3:

```java
public static void go (String str) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
    md.update(str.getBytes());
    System.out.println(md.digest());
}
```

Description: The `MessageDigest.getInstance()` method is used to create a new `MessageDigest` object. The algorithm name passed to this method is the content of the `crypto` char array. If `crypto` is altered after this method call, it could lead to unexpected changes in the cryptographic algorithm used.

Recommendation: Ensure that the `crypto` array is not altered after this method call. If the algorithm name needs to be changed, make sure to do so before this method is called.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you should not store sensitive information like cryptographic algorithm names in char arrays. Instead, use configuration files or secure key-value stores to store such information. Moreover, before using the algorithm name, clone the `CRYPTO` array and store it in `crypto` to avoid modifications to the original array affecting the new array.
