Here is the misuse classification and the code snippets:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": [
            "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));"
        ],
        "description": "The use of an obsolete and potentially broken cryptographic algorithm such as 'MD4'.",
        "recommendation": "Use more secure algorithms like 'SHA-256', 'SHA-3', or at least consider 'SHA-1' which is currently considered secure."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": [
            "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"MD4\";",
            "private static char[] CRYPTO;",
            "private static char[] crypto;",
            "go2() and go3()"
        ],
        "description": "The use of hard-coded crypto algorithms is a risk because it makes the code susceptible to cryptanalysis. Furthermore, hard-coding the algorithm could give an attacker an indication of what is being used, possibly leading them down the wrong path.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure way to choose and store cryptographic algorithms. This could involve using a configuration file, an environment variable, or some kind of user interface."
    }
