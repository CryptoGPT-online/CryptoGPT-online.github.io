The provided code sample is vulnerable to multiple types of cryptography misuses.

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The used crypto algorithm, 'MD2', is a weak algorithm. It is known to be vulnerable to attacks. It should be replaced with a strong and modern algorithm like 'SHA-256' or 'SHA-3'.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values: The 'crypto' array that is used to create the MessageDigest object does not seem to be populated with a truly random value. The code could be vulnerable to attacks that make use of predictable values. 

Here is the classification in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "MD2 is a weak cryptographic algorithm and is known to be insecure. The recommended algorithm is SHA-256 or SHA-3.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'MD2' with a stronger cryptographic algorithm such as 'SHA-256' or 'SHA-3'."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = CRYPTO;",
        "description": "The crypto array is not initialized with a truly random value which makes it less secure.",
        "recommendation": "Initialize the crypto array with a truly random value to make it more secure."
    }
]
```

Note: The misuse 'CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values' is not strictly related to the cryptography misuse, but rather how the 'crypto' array is populated. It's always best to use a truly random value when possible.
