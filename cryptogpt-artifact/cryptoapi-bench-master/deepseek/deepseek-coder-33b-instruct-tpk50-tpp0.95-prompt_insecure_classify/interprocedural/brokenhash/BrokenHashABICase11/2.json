The code given is misusing the MD4 hash algorithm, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm. In cryptography, MD4 and MD5 are considered to be weak and broken hash algorithms because they are susceptible to collision attacks and length extension attacks. 

Here are some recommendations to fix the issue:
1. If you must use MD4, increase the key size to at least 256 bits, not the 128 bits it currently has. 
2. Consider switching to a stronger hash algorithm like SHA-256.

Here is the JSON output:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": {
            "method1": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
            "method2": "method1(str2,hashAlgo);"
        },
        "description": "The code is using MD4 as the hash algorithm, which is considered a weak and broken hash algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Consider switching to a stronger hash algorithm like SHA-256. If you must use MD4, increase the key size."
    }
]
```

Note: Make sure that any code review or analysis tool parses this JSON response accurately. If the output doesn't have a JSON format, it can cause the tool to fail.
