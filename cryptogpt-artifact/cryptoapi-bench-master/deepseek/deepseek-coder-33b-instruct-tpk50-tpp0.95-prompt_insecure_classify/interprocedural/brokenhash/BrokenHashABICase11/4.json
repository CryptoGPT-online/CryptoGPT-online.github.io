    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in this code is 'MD4', which is insecure and not recommended for use. 'MD4' is considered vulnerable to attacks due to its weak design and short key length.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure algorithm like 'SHA-256', 'SHA-3', or 'SHA3-256'. You can set the algorithm using 'MessageDigest.getInstance(String algorithm)' and you can then use this instance to generate the hash. It is recommended to use a cryptographic algorithm that has not been broken, unless it is necessary for backwards compatibility."
