CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

Misuse Code:

```java
String crypto = "MD4";
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);
```

Description:

MD4 is an obsolete cryptographic hash function used in the SSL and SSH protocols. It is no longer considered secure. It should not be used for new applications. Instead, use stronger hash functions like SHA-256, SHA-3, or Bcrypt.

Recommendation:

Don't use MD4 for cryptographic operations. Instead use a stronger cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256, SHA-3, or Bcrypt.

So the response in JSON would be:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"MD4\";\nMessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "MD4 is an obsolete cryptographic hash function used in the SSL and SSH protocols. It is no longer considered secure. It should not be used for new applications. Instead, use stronger hash functions like SHA-256, SHA-3, or Bcrypt.",
        "recommendation": "Don't use MD4 for cryptographic operations. Instead use a stronger cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256, SHA-3, or Bcrypt."
    }
]
```
