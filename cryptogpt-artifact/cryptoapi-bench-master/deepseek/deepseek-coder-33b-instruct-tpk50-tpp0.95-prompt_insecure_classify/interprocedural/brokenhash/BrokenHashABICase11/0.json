The code is utilizing a risky cryptographic algorithm.

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

In the provided code, the crypto-hash algorithm "MD4" is being used. The MD4 algorithm is broken and has not been recommended for cryptographic use. In addition to the risk it poses to data integrity, it is not advised to use any cryptographic algorithm that is subject to attacks, such as MD4.

The provided code can be mitigated by simply avoiding the use of the risky algorithm, and instead using a secure alternative.
