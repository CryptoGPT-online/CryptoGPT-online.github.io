The code above is insecure because it uses the MD5 hashing algorithm which is considered weak and not secure for most purposes, and it is no longer recommended for cryptographic use due to attacks like collision attacks. The recommended cryptographic hash function is SHA-256.

Here's how you might modify it:

```java
public class B2 {
    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        String str = "abcdef";
        String crypto = "SHA-256"; // use SHA-256 instead
        go(str, crypto);
    }
    
    public static void go (String str, String crypto) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);
        md.update(str.getBytes());
        System.out.println(md.digest());
    }
}
```

Misuse:

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
