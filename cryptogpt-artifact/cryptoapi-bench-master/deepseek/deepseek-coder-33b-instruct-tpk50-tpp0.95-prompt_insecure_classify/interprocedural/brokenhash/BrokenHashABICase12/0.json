    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\")",
    "description": "The MD2 algorithm is considered to be insecure and broken. It should not be used for cryptographic purposes because it is vulnerable to collision attacks and preimage attacks. These types of attacks can be used to create a collision of the hash, which makes it possible to manipulate and tamper with data.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'MD2' with a secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. These are currently considered secure and can be used for cryptographic purposes."
