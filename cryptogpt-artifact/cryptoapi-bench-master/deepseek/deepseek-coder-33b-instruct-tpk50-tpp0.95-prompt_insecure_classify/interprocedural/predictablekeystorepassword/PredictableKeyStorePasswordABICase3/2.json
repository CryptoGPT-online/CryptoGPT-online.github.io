{
  "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
  "description": "The code is using a hardcoded value for the type of key store. The key store type is determined by a variable 'type', which is set to 'JKS' in this case. This may allow an attacker to substitute a less secure key store type if they have control over the input. In this case, 'JKS' is a strong key store type but it should not be the only option available.",
  "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding the key store type, it would be better to allow the type to be selected at runtime. This can be done by passing it as a function parameter or by reading it from a configuration file."
