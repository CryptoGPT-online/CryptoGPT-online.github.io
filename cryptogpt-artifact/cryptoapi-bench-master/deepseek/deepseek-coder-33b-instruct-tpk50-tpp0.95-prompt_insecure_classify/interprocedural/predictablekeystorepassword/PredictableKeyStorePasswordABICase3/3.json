The code is misusing the use of insecure cryptographic algorithms in several ways. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: The hardcoded credentials "changeit" in the main method are stored and used directly. This is a major security flaw as anyone who gains access to the source code will immediately know the credentials to access the KeyStore.

2. **Insecure Algorithm**: The code is using JKS, which is not a secure cryptographic algorithm and can be easily broken. JKS is known to be vulnerable to brute force attacks.

3. **Insufficiently Random Values**: The usage of the hardcoded string "changeit" as the keystore password is insufficient. Ideally, keystore passwords should be randomly generated.

4. **Insecure Network Connection**: The use of https://www.google.com as the URL for the KeyStore. This should be avoided because the connection is not secure, especially since it is an external URL.
