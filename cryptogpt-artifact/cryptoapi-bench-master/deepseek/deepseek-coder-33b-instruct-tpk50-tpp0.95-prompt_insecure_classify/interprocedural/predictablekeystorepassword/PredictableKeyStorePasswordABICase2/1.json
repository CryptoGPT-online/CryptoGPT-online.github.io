The code you provided is somewhat of a mixed bag of misuses. However, there is one misuse that stands out.

Misuse: Use of Hardcoded Cryptographic Key
Misuse Code Snippet: DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY
Description: The code hardcodes the cryptographic key "changeit" and it is used directly in the code. This is considered a bad practice because hardcoding cryptographic keys can make them easily discoverable and potentially used by unauthorized individuals.
Recommendation: Always use secure methods to store and retrieve cryptographic keys. Consider using environment variables, secure key vault services or secure encryption methods to secure your cryptographic keys.
