The code you've provided contains several instances of misuses of the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) API:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials:** The hardcoded string "changeit" is used as the encryption key, which is a security anti-pattern known as the "Use of Hard-coded Password" vulnerability.

2. **Insufficiently Random Values:** The encryption key is derived from a static string which may not provide sufficient randomness and this may lead to predictable encryption.

The above points can be demonstrated as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "private static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = \"changeit\";",
        "description": "Hard-coded passwords are bad practice and can lead to security vulnerabilities. The default encryption key in the code is hard-coded as 'changeit' which is insecure.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a random generated key or a key stored in a secure secret management system."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "ENCRYPT_KEY = DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY.toCharArray();",
        "description": "The encryption key is derived from a static string which may not provide sufficient randomness and this may lead to predictable encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the key or use a key management system to store the key securely."
    }
]
```
