The code provided has several potential security issues:

1. **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**
   The code uses the default encryption key "changeit" which is widely considered insecure. The use of "changeit" as the encryption key is a well-known vulnerability in many systems and should be avoided.

2. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**
   The code stores the encryption key in a static variable. If this key is compromised, an attacker could potentially use it to decrypt encrypted data.

3. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   The code is using the encryption key directly without any key derivation function or other encryption strength enhancing technique. This makes the encryption system vulnerable to attacks.

4. **CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation**
   The code is loading a key store using URL, which could potentially be loaded from an insecure location, like "https://www.google.com".
