This code may pose a security vulnerability due to the lack of hostname verification during the SSL handshake, which can be a risk of MITM attacks. The hostname verification is a critical part of SSL/TLS security model.

To correct this issue, you should verify the hostname in the SSL handshake. You can use a HostnameVerifier that verifies the hostname. Here is how you can modify your code:

```java
private static void go(String hostname, int soc) throws IOException {
    SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
    SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostname, soc);
    HostnameVerifier hostnameVerifier = new HostnameVerifier() {
        @Override
        public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
            return hostname.equals("my.host.name");
        }
    };
    socket.setHostnameVerifier(hostnameVerifier);
}
```

Please replace "my.host.name" with the actual hostname you expect from the server.
