Misuse: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
Misuse Code: SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
Description: The SSLSocketFactory.getDefault() method is used to get a default SSLSocketFactory. However, this method does not provide any controls over the certificate validation process, which might leave the program vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
Recommendation: Always use a properly configured SSLSocketFactory instance for secure communication. You should preferably disable or configure certificate hostname verifier or use a custom hostname verifier.

Misuse: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Misuse Code: (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
Description: The default SSLSocketFactory might use weak encryption algorithms or key sizes. This could potentially weaken the security of the communication channel, allowing eavesdropping by attackers.
Recommendation: Always use a properly configured SSLSocketFactory instance for secure communication. You should preferably configure the SSLSocketFactory to use stronger encryption algorithms. You might also need to configure the acceptable cipher suites.

Here is a suggestion to enable the hostname verifier:
```java
SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();

try {
    SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket(hostname, soc);

    // Enable hostname verifier
    HostnameVerifier hostnameVerifier = new HostnameVerifier() {
        @Override
        public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
            return true; // this disables hostname verification
        }
    };

    socket.setHostnameVerifier(hostnameVerifier);

    // Rest of your code

} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Please note that disabling the hostname verification is not secure. You should rather use a hostname verifier that checks the hostname against the server's actual hostname in the certificate. You might need to implement a custom hostname verifier for this.

Please note that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) does not provide a secure default configuration out of the box. It is recommended to specify the JSSE configuration manually to ensure proper security.
