The code you've provided is not inherently insecure. However, there are a couple of things that might need attention:

1. The `HOST_NAME` field is public. It should be either private or at least protected, so that it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, thus enhancing encapsulation.

2. In the `go()` method, you are calling `hostName.toString()` which will result in a `String` object containing the entire contents of the character array, even if it is a large array with only a few non-null characters. This is inefficient and could potentially cause issues with memory management. Instead, a `char[]` should be passed directly to the `createSocket` method.

Therefore, the code could be optimized and the recommendations would be to make `HOST_NAME` a private field and change the `go()` method to pass `HOST_NAME` directly without converting it to a string.

Here is the optimized code:

```java
public class I2 {
    private static final char[] DEFAULT_HOST_NAME = "my.host.name".toCharArray();
    private static char[] HOST_NAME;

    public static void main(String [] args) throws IOException {
        int soc = 443;
        go2();
        go(soc);
    }
    private static void go2(){
        HOST_NAME = DEFAULT_HOST_NAME;
    }

    private static void go(int soc) throws IOException {
        SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
        SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(HOST_NAME, soc);
    }
}
```
In this way, the `HOST_NAME` field is private and is directly passed to the `createSocket` method without any unnecessary conversions. This way, we've made the code more efficient and improved encapsulation.
