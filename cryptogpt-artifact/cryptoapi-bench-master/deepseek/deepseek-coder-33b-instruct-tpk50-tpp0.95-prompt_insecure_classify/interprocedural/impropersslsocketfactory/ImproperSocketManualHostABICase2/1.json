    "description": "The variable DEFAULT_HOST_NAME is hardcoded into the program, meaning any instance of the program using this hostname will have this same hostname. This is generally considered a bad practice as it can expose sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, and keys.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a secure method to store and retrieve this data. You could use environment variables or a secure vault service. Also, do not hardcode sensitive data in the source code. Use configuration files or secure storage services."
