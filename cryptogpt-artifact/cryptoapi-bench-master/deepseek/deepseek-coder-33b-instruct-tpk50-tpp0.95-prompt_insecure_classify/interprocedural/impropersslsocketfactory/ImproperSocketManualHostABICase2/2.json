The code you provided does not have any misuses per se, but there are two things worth noting:

1. The `toString()` method is not used correctly in the line `socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostName.toString(),soc);`. The `toString()` method in Java converts a character array into a string, but in this case, it is not necessary because the `createSocket()` method expects a `String` as the first argument, not a character array. 

2. This code is hardcoding the host name to "my.host.name". It would be better to make it a configurable parameter rather than hardcoding it.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public class I2 {
    private static String DEFAULT_HOST_NAME = "my.host.name";
    private static String hostName;

    public static void main(String [] args) throws IOException {
        int soc = 443;
        go2();
        go3();
        go(soc);
    }
    private static void go2(){
        DEFAULT_HOST_NAME = "my.host.name";
    }
    private static void go3(){
        hostName = DEFAULT_HOST_NAME;
    }

    private static void go(int soc) throws IOException {
        SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
        SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostName, soc);
    }
}
```

Please note that `hostName` is still hardcoded here, you should make it a configurable parameter or get it from user input. If you have a reason to keep `DEFAULT_HOST_NAME` as a field, you should use it instead of `hostName` in the `createSocket()` method.
