The code provided has no clear signs of misuse of cryptographic APIs. The PBEParameterSpec class is used for specifying parameters for password-based encryption. Its constructors accept a salt and iteration count, which are essential for secure encryption. The salt is used to prevent pre-computation attacks, and the iteration count increases the computational cost, making it more difficult to brute-force the encryption key. 

However, if the iteration count is less than a certain value, it may be considered a weak use of cryptographic algorithm. Commonly, the recommended iteration count for PBKDF2 (the algorithm often used with PBEParameterSpec) is at least 1000. 

So, based on this, the code could be improved as follows:

```java
public class S3 {
    public static void main(String [] args){
        byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};
        int count = 1020;
        method1(salt,count);
    }
    public static void method1(byte[] s, int c){
        int count2 = c;
        method2(s,count2);
    }

    public static void method2(byte[] salt, int count){
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        if(count < 1000){
            System.out.println("WARNING: Weak iteration count for PBEParameterSpec");
        }
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
    }
}
```

This code introduces a simple warning when the iteration count is less than 1000, to alert the developer that a possibly weak PBEParameterSpec might be used.
