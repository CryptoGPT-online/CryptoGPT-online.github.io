The provided code does not directly use any insecure crypto API. However, there are a couple of things worth pointing out:

1. The code uses a fixed salt value which is not a random value. Ideally, a salt should be a unique, random value for each password hash.

2. The code uses a fixed iteration count of 1020. Ideally, the number of iterations should be high enough to provide reasonable protection against brute force attacks. However, the specific number may vary based on the security requirements and resource constraints.

So, here are the misuses:

1. Use of insufficiently random values.
2. Use of a static password/salt.
