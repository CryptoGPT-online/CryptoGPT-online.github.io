        "vulnerable_code": "method2(salt,count)",
        "description": "The salt has only one byte and the iteration count is 1020, which are both insecure and less than the recommended values.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a random salt of at least 64 bits (8 bytes) length and use a larger iteration count. For example, use a value like 2^20. This will increase the time and resources required to break the encryption."
