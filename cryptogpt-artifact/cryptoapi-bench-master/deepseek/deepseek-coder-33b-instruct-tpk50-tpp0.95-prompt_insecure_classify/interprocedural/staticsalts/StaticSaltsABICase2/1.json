The code contains a hard-coded cryptographic key (salt) used in the PBEParameterSpec, which makes it vulnerable to dictionary attacks, as well as brute force attacks. This is a CWE-330 use of insufficiently random values, as the salt is not randomly generated, and thus does not offer enough entropy. It is also not stored securely, as the salt is a static field and can be easily accessed.
