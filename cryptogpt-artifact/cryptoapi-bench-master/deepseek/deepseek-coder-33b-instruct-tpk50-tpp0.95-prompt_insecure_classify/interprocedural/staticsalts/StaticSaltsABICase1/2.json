    "description": "The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) PBE (Password-Based Encryption) supports PBEWithHmacSHA, which defaults to using HMAC-SHA1 as its pseudo-random function and uses a 1024 bit salt. However, it is generally not recommended to use such small iteration counts (like 1020) as they could reduce the strength of the derived key.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use at least 1024 iterations for the PBE. However, for better security, the key length and iteration count should be increased significantly."
