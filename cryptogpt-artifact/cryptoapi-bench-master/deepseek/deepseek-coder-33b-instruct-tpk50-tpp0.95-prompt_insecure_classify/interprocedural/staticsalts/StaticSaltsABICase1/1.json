This code seems to be performing PBE (Password-Based Encryption) using a salt and iteration count. There are no apparent misuses of crypto API.

However, this code doesn't utilize any cryptographic algorithm to perform the PBE operation. It merely creates a `PBEParameterSpec` instance using a salt and iteration count.

To fix this, you could use a cryptographic algorithm like PBEwithSHAand128BitAES-CBC-BC, for example, to generate the keys for encryption.

Here's an example of how you might do this:

```java
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEParameterSpec;
import java.security.spec.KeySpec;

public class S1 {

    public static void main(String [] args){
        S1 cs = new S1();
        byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};
        int count = 1020;
        char[] password = "password".toCharArray();
        cs.key2(salt,count, password);

    }
    public void key2(byte[] salt, int count, char[] password){
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
        KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password);
        try {
            SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBEWithHmacSHA1AndAES_128");
            factory.generateSecret(spec);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using a salt and password to create a key, and then using that key to create a `SecretKeyFactory`. This is a simple example and may not be suitable for your actual use case. Always consult with a cryptography expert when dealing with cryptographic operations.
