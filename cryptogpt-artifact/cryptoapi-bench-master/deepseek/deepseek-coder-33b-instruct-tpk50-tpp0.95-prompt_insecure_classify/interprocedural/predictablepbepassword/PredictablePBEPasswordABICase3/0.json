Here are the CWE vulnerabilities present in the provided code:

1. 
CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
The PBEWithMD5AndDES algorithm is no longer considered secure, due to its short key length. Using it with a large iteration count (11010) can lead to performance problems.
Vulnerable Code: `pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);`
Description: The `PBEWithMD5AndDES` algorithm is used here. It should be replaced with a stronger algorithm.
Recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm such as `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256` or `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512`. Consider increasing the key length and iteration count to make the algorithm secure.

2.
CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
The salt used in the code is randomly generated but not seeded with a secure random number generator. This can lead to predictable salt values, which can make it easier for attackers to guess the password hash.
Vulnerable Code: `sr.nextBytes(salt);`
Description: The salt used in the code is not properly seeded.
Recommendation: Use a secure random number generator to seed the salt value.

3.
CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
The iteration count used in the code (11010) is much higher than the recommended value (10000). The higher iteration count can make the algorithm slower, which can be a denial of service risk.
Vulnerable Code: `int iterationCount = 11010;`
Description: The iteration count used is much higher than recommended.
Recommendation: Use a lower iteration count value. It is recommended to use a value such as 10000 or higher, depending on the security requirements.
