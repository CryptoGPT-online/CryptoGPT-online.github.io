The code you've given is using Password-Based Encryption (PBE) which is a secure way to store a password, however, the following issues can be found:

1. Using Static Salt: The salt is being created each time the method is called, which makes the cipher always create a different ciphertext even for the same password. This defeats the purpose of salt.

2. Using Low Iteration Count: The iteration count is low (11010), which is less secure than the recommended value.

3. Using Static Iteration Count: The iteration count is hardcoded, which means it doesn't change based on the system's performance. High iteration counts can slow down the application unnecessarily.

Here is the JSON response with the identified issues:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = new byte[16];\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The salt is not being generated using a secure random number generator, making it less random and more vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the salt using a cryptographically secure random number generator."

    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
    "description": "The iteration count is very low, making the hashing function run faster which can reduce the time to crack the password. A minimum of 1000 is recommended.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a minimum of 1000."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
    "description": "The iteration count is static and doesn't adapt to the system's performance, making it more vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a way to increase the iteration count based on system performance to adapt to the hardware. Also consider a random number of iterations to ensure that every execution is unique."
