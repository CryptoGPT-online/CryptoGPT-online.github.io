There are several misuses in the code. 

1. Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: 
PBEWithMD5AndDES is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. It uses MD5 for password-based key derivation and DES for data encryption. There are many ways to break these algorithms, such as collision attacks on the hash function or exploiting the design flaws of the encryption algorithm. 
Misuse:
```java
new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);
```
Description: This code uses PBEWithMD5AndDES, which is a risky and broken cryptographic algorithm. 
Recommendation: Use a modern, well-vetted and secure algorithm like AES or PBKDF2.

2. Improper Certificate Validation:
There is no certificate validation in the code. This could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack. 
Misuse: N/A
Description: There is no certificate validation.
Recommendation: Validate the certificate of the server before transmitting any sensitive data.

3. Use of Insufficiently Random Values:
The salt used in the code is not sufficiently random. It's generated from a SecureRandom instance, but the SecureRandom's seed is not expected to be securely generated. If the seed can be guessed or known, the salt can also be guessed or known.
Misuse:
```java
sr.nextBytes(salt);
```
Description: The salt is not randomly generated.
Recommendation: Use a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) to generate the salt.

4. Inadequate Encryption Strength:
The iteration count and key length are low, which makes the encryption weak.
Misuse:
```java
int iterationCount = 11010;
int keyLength = 16;
```
Description: The iteration count and key length are low.
Recommendation: Use stronger key lengths (>=128 bits for AES) and iteration counts (>=1000) for key derivation.

Please note that I have not detected misuses related to hardcoded credentials, selection of less secure algorithms during negotiation, and the use of static password/salt. As they are less concerning for a cryptographic API, and they require further context about the system and the security context.
