The code you provided is using PBKDF2 with a low iteration count (10000) and a static key. This can be a security concern as:

1. Low iteration counts can increase the time taken for PBKDF2 to run and make it more susceptible to attacks (like brute force and dictionary attacks).
2. The use of a static key without any protection can expose it if the application is compromised.

Here are some recommendations to improve the code:

1. Increase the iteration count to a more secure level. For PBKDF2, 10,000 iterations are considered secure for most purposes.
2. Use a secret key stored in a secure environment, like a secret manager or a hardware security module (HSM), to protect the key.
