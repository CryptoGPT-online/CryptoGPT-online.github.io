The following crypto API misuse has been identified in your code:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = new byte[16];\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The code generates a random byte array using SecureRandom but does not use a secure seed or ensure that the SecureRandom is properly seeded. This can lead to predictable random numbers and thus could make the encryption less secure.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to seed SecureRandom with a secure random number or use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the salt. Additionally, ensure the seeding process is performed securely."
    }
