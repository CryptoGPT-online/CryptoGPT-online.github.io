The provided code is secure, as it uses a hardcoded cryptographic algorithm, which is AES, and uses the recommended modes and padding. However, it is not checking if the provided crypto string matches the hardcoded one, which is "AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding". 

This is a misuse:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
        "vulnerable_code": "method1(crypto)",
        "description": "The crypto parameter in method1 is not checked to ensure that it matches the hardcoded algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "You should check if the provided crypto parameter matches the expected value. If not, you should throw an exception or log a warning."
    }
]
```

If you want to strictly enforce only a specific algorithm and its modes and padding, you can change the code like this:

```java
public static void method2(String c) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
    String cryptoAlgo = c;
    if (!cryptoAlgo.equals("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding")) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Only AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding is allowed.");
    }
    method1(cryptoAlgo);
}
```
