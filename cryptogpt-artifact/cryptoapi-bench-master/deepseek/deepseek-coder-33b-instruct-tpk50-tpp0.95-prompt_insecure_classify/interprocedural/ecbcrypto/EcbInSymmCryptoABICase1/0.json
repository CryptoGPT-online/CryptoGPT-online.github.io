        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The use of the AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding cipher is considered insecure due to its use of ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode. ECB mode does not include any form of encryption sequencing. It does not hide patterns. It's easy to encrypt several identical plain texts and thus makes the encrypted text identical as well. This is very risky because it allows an attacker to infer some information about the original plaintext based on patterns in the encrypted text.",
        "recommendation": "Do not use AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding. Instead, use a secure mode like AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding (Cipher Block Chaining)."
