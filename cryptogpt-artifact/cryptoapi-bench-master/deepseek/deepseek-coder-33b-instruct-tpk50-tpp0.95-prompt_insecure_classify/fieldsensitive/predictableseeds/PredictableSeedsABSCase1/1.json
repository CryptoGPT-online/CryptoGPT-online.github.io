        "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG). However, the use of `SecureRandom` with a low-entropy seed (e.g. a hardcoded array of bytes in this case) can be a security risk, because it allows an attacker to predict future values of `nextInt()`, similar to a predictable random number generator.",

        "vulnerable_code": "C1(byte [] seed) -> C1()",
        "description": "In the class `C1`, the constructor uses `SecureRandom` to generate a seed. However, in the provided example, the seed is always `{100, 200}`. This means that the generated random number sequence will always be the same, and this can lead to predictable behavior and vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using a fixed seed, consider generating a random seed every time. Use a strong, pseudo-random number generator to generate this seed."
