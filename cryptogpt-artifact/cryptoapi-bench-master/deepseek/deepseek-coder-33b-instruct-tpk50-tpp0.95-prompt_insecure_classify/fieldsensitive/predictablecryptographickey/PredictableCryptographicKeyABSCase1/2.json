The code provided seems to be using the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to perform encryption. However, it has the following cryptographic misuses:

1. Use of a hardcoded default key:
```java
public Co(String defkey) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    cipher = Cipher.getInstance(algoSpec);
    defaultKey = defkey;
}
```
In this method, a default key is hardcoded. This default key is used if the provided key is empty. This might make it easier for an attacker to decrypt the data if they can find the hardcoded key.

Recommendation: Generate a random key instead of using a hardcoded one.

2. Lack of key strength check:
```java
keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);
```
The code snippet is truncating the keyBytes to a fixed length of 16 bytes, which is insecure because it limits the key space to 16^16 possibilities. A larger key space should be used to increase security.

Recommendation: Do not truncate the keyBytes.

3. Use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding:
```java
algoSpec = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding";
```
The AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding mode is known to have a few weaknesses. It may be more secure to use a different cipher mode like AES/GCM/NoPadding.

Recommendation: Use AES/GCM/NoPadding instead.

4. Hardcoded keys:
```java
crypto = new Co("defaultkey");
```
In the P1 constructor, a hardcoded key is used.

Recommendation: Use a randomly generated key instead.

5. No check for null return in getKey method:
```java
public static String getKey(String s) {
    return System.getProperty(s);
}
```
This method returns a null value if the provided key is not found. The P1 class checks the return value of getKey, but it does not handle the case where the return value is null.

Recommendation: Add a null check for the return value of getKey, and handle the case where the key is not found.

6. Unhandled NoSuchAlgorithmException and NoSuchPaddingException:
Both NoSuchAlgorithmException and NoSuchPaddingException are unhandled, and this could potentially lead to runtime exceptions or other issues if they occur.

Recommendation: Handle these exceptions properly.

Please note that these are just potential issues. The actual risk level depends on the overall application and its security requirements.
