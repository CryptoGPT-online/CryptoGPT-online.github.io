  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "String algoSpec = \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\";",
  "description": "AES is a strong symmetric encryption algorithm, but this specific mode of operation (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding) is not considered secure in most circumstances. ECB mode of operation is vulnerable to repeated plaintext attack. The default AES mode in Java is ECB.",
  "recommendation": "Replace the \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" mode of operation with a secure alternative. You might consider using AES/GCM/NoPadding which provides both confidentiality and integrity (authenticity), although it has specific requirements that need to be met."
