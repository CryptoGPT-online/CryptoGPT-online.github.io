The code is creating a new URL object from a string. This operation is unsafe because it does not handle exceptions. 

In your case, if the passedURL is not a valid URL, an instance of MalformedURLException will be thrown. However, there is no catch block in your method1, which will make your program terminate abruptly instead of handling the exception.

So, here is how you can modify your code to handle this exception:

```java
public class H1 {
    C1 crypto;
    public H1() {
        String url = "http://gmail.com";
        crypto = new C1(url);
        crypto.method1("");
    }
}

class C1 {
    String defURL;

    public C1(String url){
        defURL = url;
    }

    public void method1(String passedURL) {
        try {
            if(passedURL.isEmpty()){
                passedURL = defURL;
            }
            System.out.println(new URL(passedURL));
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            // or handle the exception in some other way
        }
    }
}
```

This is a "CWE-395: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions". Always remember to handle your exceptions to prevent your programs from terminating abruptly.
