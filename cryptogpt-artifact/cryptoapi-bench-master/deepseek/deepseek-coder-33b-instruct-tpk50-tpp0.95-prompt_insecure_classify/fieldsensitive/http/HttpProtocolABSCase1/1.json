The provided code snippet is using `new URL(passedURL)` to create a URL object. However, this could potentially allow an attacker to perform a SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) attack by providing a malicious URL.

The Java URL class constructor does not validate the URL to ensure that it's not a local or malicious URL. This could potentially result in an attacker accessing local files or potentially running commands on the server.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
        "vulnerable_code": "new URL(passedURL)",
        "description": "The 'passedURL' variable is used to create a URL object in 'method1'. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform a SSRF attack.",
        "recommendation": "Validate 'passedURL' to ensure it's a valid and safe URL before creating a URL object from it."
    }
]
```
