The code provided does not contain any major cryptographic misuses, but there is a potential misuse related to URL validation. 

A potential misuse may be CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation, if you are using the Java URL class to establish secure connections to a host.

Here is a JSON response:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(passedURL));",
        "description": "The URL class in Java does not validate the SSL certificate of a host by default, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. You should use a trust manager or a custom SSLSocketFactory to validate the server's certificate.",
        "recommendation": "You can use javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection class or javax.net.ssl.SSLContext to establish a secure connection."
    }
]
