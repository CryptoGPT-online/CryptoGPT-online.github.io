Based on the provided Java code, the following misuses are detected:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:
   - Misuse: "TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV" is enabled by default. This mode provides a minor downgrade attack protection. However, if the server supports this mode, it may offer protection against some side channel attacks. 
   - Vulnerable Code: `SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(passedHostname,passedSoc);`
   - Description: The default SSLSocketFactory may be configured with the "TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV" cipher suite, which can be vulnerable to a side channel attack due to the mode's minor downgrade protection.
   - Recommendation: Ensure that the SSLSocketFactory is configured with the most secure cipher suites and protocols, and consider disabling "TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV".

Please note that the misuses are based on the assumption that the rest of the code and environment is secure and correctly configured. This code should be analyzed in the context of the rest of the system to understand any additional vulnerabilities.
