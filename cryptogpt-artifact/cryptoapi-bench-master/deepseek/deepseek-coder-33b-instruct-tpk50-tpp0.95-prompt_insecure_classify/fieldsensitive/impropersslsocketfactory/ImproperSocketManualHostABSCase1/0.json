The code you have provided doesn't directly involve any cryptographic API misuses but there is a potential misuse scenario.

1. The code creates an `SSLSocket` without any cryptographic security policy, which might be vulnerable to "man-in-the-middle" attacks. It is recommended to use a `SSLContext` with a trust manager and a key manager to enforce cryptographic security.

2. The code doesn't handle exceptions that might occur during the creation of the `SSLSocket`. This could potentially lead to runtime errors.

Here is how the code can be modified to address these issues:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.KeyManagementException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

public class I1 {
    C1 crypto;
    public I1() {
        String hostname = "my.host.name";
        int soc = 443;
        crypto = new C1(hostname, soc);
    }
}

class C1 {
    String defHostname;
    int defSoc;

    public C1(String hostname, int soc) {
        defHostname = hostname;
        defSoc = soc;
    }

    public void encrypt(String passedHostname,int passedSoc) throws IOException {

        if(passedHostname.isEmpty()) {
            passedHostname = defHostname;
            passedSoc = defSoc;
        }

        try {
            SSLContext ctx = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
            ctx.init(new KeyManager[0], new TrustManager[] {new DefaultTrustManager()}, new SecureRandom());
            SSLSocketFactory ssf = ctx.getSocketFactory();
            SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(passedHostname,passedSoc);
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | KeyManagementException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error creating SSL socket", e);
        }
    }
}

class DefaultTrustManager implements X509TrustManager {
    @Override
    public void checkClientTrusted(java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) {
        // No need to check client trust, trust all
    }

    @Override
    public void checkServerTrusted(java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) {
        // No need to check server trust, trust all
    }

    @Override
    public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
        return new java.security.cert.X509Certificate[0];
    }
}
```

In the above code, a `SSLContext` is created with a `DefaultTrustManager`. This trust manager doesn't validate the server's certificate, which could be a problem if the certificate is not trusted. In a real-world scenario, you would need to properly validate the server's certificate.
