The code you provided is a simple example of symmetric encryption. However, it has several security misuses which should be addressed:

1. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Algorithm

- The default algorithm "Blowfish" in the example is considered insecure. It has a key length of 128 bits, and according to NIST, a key length of 112 bits or more is required for modern applications. Furthermore, Blowfish does not support variable-length keys. This can make it susceptible to attacks that target specific key length. 
- It's recommended to use an algorithm like AES, which supports variable-length keys and is a current and popular choice.

2. Inadequate Encryption Strength

- The key size used in this example (generally 128 bits for AES) is quite small for modern security standards. Using large key sizes (ideally 256 bits for AES) increases the resistance to brute-force attacks and is recommended.

3. Use of Insufficiently Random Values

- In the provided code, a key is generated each time an encryption is performed without a randomized seed. This can make the encryption vulnerable to certain types of attacks if the same key is used repeatedly. 
- It's recommended to use a method that generates random keys each time.

4. Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation

- In this code, the encryption algorithm is selected based on the passedAlgo parameter, which can be easily manipulated by the user. This can lead to insecure encryption practices, such as using less secure algorithms or keys.
- To avoid this, the algorithm should not be chosen based on user input. Instead, it should be selected with sufficient care.
