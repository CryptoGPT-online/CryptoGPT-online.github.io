The code you provided has multiple misuses of the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) API and they are classified as follows:

1) Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:
  
- In your code, the default algorithm is set to DES which is a known weak cipher and considered risky. The DES algorithm was broken for a long time and it is generally recommended to use stronger encryption algorithms like AES.
- There is also a lack of integrity check, like a HMAC, which is a recommended security practice for cryptographic APIs.

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "defaultAlgo = defAlgo; \n Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The use of DES is a known risky cryptographic algorithm as it is weak and has been broken for a long time.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES."
}]
```

Note: The above issue does not have a solution directly as the issue lies in the algorithm choice.

For a secure implementation, it would also be useful to include an integrity check, which can be accomplished by using a message authentication code (MAC) or a digital signature along with the encryption to provide data integrity.

2) Improper Certificate Validation:

- In your code, there is no certificate validation in the code. If the server's certificate needs to be validated, it can be achieved through setting the appropriate SSL/TLS configuration and making sure the correct certificates are in the trust store.

3) Use of Insufficiently Random Values:

- In your code, a KeyGenerator is used to generate a secret key. This is not recommended for secure implementations, as it can lead to predictable keys and potential security risks.

4) Inadequate Encryption Strength:

- Your code creates a key using a key size that might not be securely long enough. DES keys are 56 bits long, which is considered too short by modern standards. For AES, a 256-bit key provides a good level of security.

5) Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation:

- There is no negotiation of cryptographic algorithms during communication. It's crucial to protect against the downgrade attack where an attacker makes the system negotiate a less secure algorithm.

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "No specific code snippet that directly relates to this misuse as it's a network communication concern",
    "description": "During a cryptographic negotiation, an attacker might propose a less secure algorithm to trick a user into using it.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a secure negotiation of cryptographic algorithms to prevent the downgrade attack."
}]
```

Remember, it's important to follow best practices for secure cryptographic design, including not using known-broken algorithms, maintaining secure key sizes, and implementing strong random number generators.
