The provided code is using the deprecated IDEA cipher algorithm, which is considered weak. Moreover, it is using the same key for encryption. This is insecure and not recommended for any real-world use case. The key used should be random and kept secret. 

Here is the JSON format response:
```json

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", 
    "vulnerable_code": [
        "crypto = new C6(\"IDEA\");",
        "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);"
    ],
    "description": "IDEA algorithm is considered weak and no longer recommended for encryption.", 
    "recommendation": "Use stronger and recommended cryptographic algorithms such as AES."
}, {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", 
    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "Key used for encryption is not random and hardcoded.", 
    "recommendation": "Generate a random key for every encryption operation."
