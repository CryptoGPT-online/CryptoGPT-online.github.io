The code you provided is using the PBEParameterSpec class with a variable passedCount which is never changed inside the method. This value is being passed as is to PBEParameterSpec which is prone to security issues. In PBEParameterSpec salt should be a randomly generated value and the iteration count should be high enough for the encryption method to be secure but not too high to cause an unnecessary delay.

Here's how to modify your code:

```java
class C1 {
    int defcount;

    public C1(int count) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        defcount = count;
    }

    public void method1(int passedCount) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, InvalidKeyException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException {

        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        byte[] salt = new byte[32];
        random.nextBytes(salt);

        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, passedCount);

    }
}
```

In the above code, passedCount is now used as the iteration count in PBEParameterSpec, ensuring a high enough iteration count for the encryption method to be secure. However, the value of passedCount is passed from outside the method making it susceptible to manipulation and thus may not always be secure. 

It's important to validate the passed value of passedCount and set a default value if it's invalid. 

Moreover, the exception handling should be done more carefully. There's no need to catch the same exceptions multiple times for different methods, only at the highest level should suffice. 

In addition, the class `L1` should be implemented to handle exceptions that may arise in `method1` and should not just throw them up.

Here is the suggested code:

```java
public class L1 {
    C1 crypto;
    public L1() {
        try {
            crypto = new C1(20);
            crypto.method1(0);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exceptions as needed
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
