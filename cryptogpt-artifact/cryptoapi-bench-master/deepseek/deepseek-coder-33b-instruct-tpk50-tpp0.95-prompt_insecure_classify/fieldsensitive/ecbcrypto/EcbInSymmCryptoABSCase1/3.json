"misuse type": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");", 
"description": "The AES key length is 128 bits by default, and this might not be secure enough for some applications. For example, the NIST recently recommended a minimum of 112 bits for AES due to concerns about quantum computing threats to AES. For stronger security, a higher key length should be used.", 
"recommendation": "Use a higher key length for the AES algorithm. For example, 192 or 256 bits."
