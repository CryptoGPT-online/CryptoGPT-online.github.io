    "description": "The crypto variable in this line is set to the instance of 'defCrypto' in the constructor of C4 class. 'defCrypto' is passed to this method when it's invoked, but it's not user controlled input. This code is using an insecure crypto algorithm, in this case, MD2.",
    "recommendation": "Use secure cryptographic algorithms that have not been proved to be insecure in the past, like SHA-256. Also, consider using a key-derivation function (KDF), such as bcrypt or PBKDF2, to increase security even more."
