CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

Misuse:
Use of MD2 hash algorithm.

Misuse Code:
`MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);`

Description:
The code uses the cryptographic hashing function MD2. This algorithm is considered weak, and has been proven to be vulnerable to a number of attacks. Attackers can generate hash collisions and may be able to forge messages. 

Recommendation:
It is recommended to use stronger algorithms such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. Additionally, it is advisable to switch to a keyed message authentication code (HMAC), as it provides similar security properties while being more secure against some types of attacks.
