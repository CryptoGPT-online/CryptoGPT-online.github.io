This code has a number of issues that can be considered as misuses of cryptographic API. The issues are:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

The SHA1 algorithm is not considered secure anymore. This algorithm is used for password hashing and checksum generation, but it is too weak to be used for any other purpose. 

Here is the vulnerable code:
```
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);
```

2. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.

This code doesn't use certificates or keys for any purpose, so there is no need for certificate validation. 

3. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

There is no code that suggests any use of insufficiently random values in cryptography.

4. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.

The SHA1 algorithm is not used for encryption, so there is no need for checking encryption strength.

5. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.

This code doesn't use any hardcoded credentials.

6. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.

The code doesn't seem to use any algorithms for negotiation.

Please note that other categories like CWE-330, CWE-326, CWE-757 do not apply to this code as they are related to cryptographic API usage, but not a misuse in this context.
