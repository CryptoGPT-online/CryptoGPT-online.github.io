The code has a couple of misuses:

1. The use of an insecure cryptographic algorithm (SHA1)
2. The lack of encryption

Here's how to classify them:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
    - Misuse: Crypto algorithm - SHA1
    - Vulnerable Code: `crypto = new C1("SHA1");`
    - Description: SHA1 is a weak cryptographic hash function that can be susceptible to various attacks.
    - Recommendation: Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3.

2. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
    - Misuse: No certificate validation
    - Vulnerable Code: None as the code does not use certificate-based encryption.
    - Description: When using certificates, ensure that they are properly validated and trusted. In this case, there is no certificate validation.
    - Recommendation: Use a trusted certificate and validate it properly.

3. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
    - Misuse: No use of random values
    - Vulnerable Code: None as the code does not use random values.
    - Description: Even if using secure cryptographic algorithms, it's important to use enough random data (salt) to prevent predictable outputs.
    - Recommendation: Use a cryptographic random number generator (CSPRNG) for generating secure random numbers.

Please note that cryptographic misuses can be quite diverse and depend on the specific context. The above categories are general guidelines and the code may have more specific issues. Please consult a security expert for a thorough review.
