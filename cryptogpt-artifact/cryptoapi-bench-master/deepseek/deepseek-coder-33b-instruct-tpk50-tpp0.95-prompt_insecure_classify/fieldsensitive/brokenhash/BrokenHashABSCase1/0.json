The provided code is using SHA-1 for the message digest which is a weak cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327). The use of SHA-1 is also insecure because it has been proven to have collision attacks. 

Also, the code seems to have a weakness where an empty string can be passed as a parameter for the encryption function. This would use the default algorithm for both encryption and digest. While it is unlikely that this would be a problem in practice, it is generally a good practice to avoid this to avoid potential confusion or unintended behavior.
