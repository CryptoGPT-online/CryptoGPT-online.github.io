There are two significant cryptographic misuses in this code:

1. The MD4 cryptographic hash function has been deprecated by the NIST as of 2010. It is now recommended to use SHA-2 or SHA-3 families for security sensitive applications.

2. The use of a static salt or password in encryption. In the given code, a blank string is used as salt, which is very insecure and may lead to dictionary attacks or rainbow table attacks. A random salt, or a key, should always be used in an encryption process.

The code snippet for these misuses are as follows:

In the class C3:

```
public void encrypt(String str, String passedAlgo) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, InvalidKeyException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException {
    if(passedAlgo.isEmpty()){
        passedAlgo = crypto;
    }

    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto); // The crypto hash function used here is MD4
    md.update(str.getBytes());
    System.out.println(md.digest());

}
```

Here is the JSON response:
