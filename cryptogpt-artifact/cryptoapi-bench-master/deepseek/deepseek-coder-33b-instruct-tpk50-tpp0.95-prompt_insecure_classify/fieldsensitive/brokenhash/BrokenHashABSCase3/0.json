There is an insecure use of the cryptographic algorithm in this code. The algorithm used for encryption in this code is "MD4". This algorithm is considered weak and insecure and may not provide the same level of security as some more recent and stronger algorithms, such as "SHA-256" or "SHA-3".

It's a CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. It may lead to vulnerabilities in data integrity and confidentiality.

        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm MD4 is considered weak and insecure. It's not recommended for use in secure applications.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead of MD4. An example could be MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");"
