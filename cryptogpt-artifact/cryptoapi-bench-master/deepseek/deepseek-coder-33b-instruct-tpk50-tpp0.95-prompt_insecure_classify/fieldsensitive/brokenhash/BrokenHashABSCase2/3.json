Here are the code analysis and misuses:

1. The cryptographic algorithm is hardcoded in the C2 class, which could be problematic if there is a need to change the algorithm in the future. This leads to CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.

2. The MessageDigest class is used for hashing the input string, not encryption. It should be replaced with Cipher class for encryption. This can be misused by a CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.

3. The encryption process in the given code doesn't include any salt or IV. This can cause issues as it makes the encryption process deterministic and potentially easier to crack. This could be CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

4. The encryption key is not validated and there is no check if the user provided a proper encryption algorithm. This opens up for CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.

5. The code is using static algorithms for the MessageDigest, this could also be subject to CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.

6. There is no check for minimum key length requirement of cryptographic algorithms, hence could lead to CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.
