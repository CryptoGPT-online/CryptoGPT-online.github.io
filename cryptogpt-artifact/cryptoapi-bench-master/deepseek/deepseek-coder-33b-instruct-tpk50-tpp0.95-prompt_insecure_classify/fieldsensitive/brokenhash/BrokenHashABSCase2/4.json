        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm for cryptographic purposes. MD5 is a broken algorithm as it is susceptible to hash collisions and has a small digest size, which makes it not suitable for cryptographic applications like storing passwords. In the case of this code, it's used with a single line of input 'abc', which makes the hash irreversible, and makes it even more susceptible to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm for hashing like SHA-256. Also, in the specific case of storing passwords, use bcrypt, or a similar salted hash function."
    },

        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C2(\"MD5\");",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm \"MD5\" is hardcoded into the constructor of the C2 class. This can lead to inconsistencies and reduce maintainability if different parts of the codebase use different algorithms.",
        "recommendation": "Consider making the algorithm selection more flexible and secure, possibly by storing the algorithm name in a configuration file or environment variable."
