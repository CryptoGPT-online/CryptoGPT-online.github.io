    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "The salt is using a static value. This may make the encryption less secure as it is predictable. An attacker can try different salt values until they find one that results in the desired hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate salt. This ensures that the salt is unpredictable and random which makes the hash hard to crack."

    "description": "The iteration count is very low. The number of iterations is typically around 1000 to the order of magnitude of the amount of processing power available. Using a lower iteration count can make the process faster, but it also makes it less secure.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value based on the resources available and the level of security required."

    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec is being used to specify the parameters of a PBE (Password-Based Encryption) scheme. The PBEParameterSpec class is a default implementation provided by Java, which may not be secure or efficient. Also, PBEParameterSpec is not used in the provided code to specify the iteration count or the key length, which can be used to increase security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a different implementation of the PBEParameterSpec that takes into account key length and iteration count. Alternatively, consider using an encryption library that provides a higher level of abstraction and is designed for secure use."
