        "description": "The IV (Initialization Vector) is a non-secret value but it should be chosen in a secure manner to ensure it cannot be predicted or guessed. The IV here is derived from a non-random source, which can make the ciphertext vulnerable to attacks such as repeated ciphertext attacks. If the IV is predictable, then two encryptions of the same plaintext will yield the same ciphertext, allowing an attacker to recover plaintext data by comparing them.",

        "description": "Using the AES algorithm with a default key size of 128 bits is insecure because it is considered too weak. AES allows key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Keys of 128 bits are now considered breakable. Using 128 bit AES encryption can potentially leave data vulnerable to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a key length of 192 or 256 bits when generating AES keys. These are currently considered secure by experts in the field of cryptography."
