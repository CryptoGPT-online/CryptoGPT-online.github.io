public void method1(byte[] passedIV) {
    passedIV = defIV; // This is not secure. IV should be securely random.
    IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(passedIV);
    ...
}
```

2. The "AES" algorithm is not a secure choice. "AES" is not considered secure anymore. It is better to use "AES/GCM/NoPadding" or "AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding" instead.

```java
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec); // This is not secure. 
```

These issues are considered as "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" and "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength".

To fix the issues, you should use a secure IV and use a secure algorithm. The following code generates a secure IV, selects a secure algorithm, and uses that.

```java
public void method1(byte[] passedIV) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException {
    SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
    byte[] iv = new byte[16];
    random.nextBytes(iv); // securely generate an IV
    IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
    KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
    SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"); // use a secure algorithm
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key,ivSpec);
}
```

In this code, the SecureRandom class is used to generate a secure random IV. The "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" algorithm is used to encrypt the data.

Remember that choosing a secure encryption algorithm requires considering the level of protection that is required by your specific use case.

These issues were found in the "C1" class of the "S1" class.
