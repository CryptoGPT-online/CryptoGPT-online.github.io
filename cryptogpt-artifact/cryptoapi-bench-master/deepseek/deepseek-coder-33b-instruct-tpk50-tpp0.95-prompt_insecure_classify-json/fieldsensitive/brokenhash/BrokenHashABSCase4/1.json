{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the cryptographic hashing function MD2. This algorithm is considered weak, and has been proven to be vulnerable to a number of attacks. Attackers can generate hash collisions and may be able to forge messages.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use stronger algorithms such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. Additionally, it is advisable to switch to a keyed message authentication code (HMAC), as it provides similar security properties while being more secure against some types of attacks."
