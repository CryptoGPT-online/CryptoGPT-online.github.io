[{
	"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
	"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo)",
	"description": "The code is using IDEA as a cryptographic algorithm in the encryption process. IDEA is a broken cipher, its security is not as strong as other modern algorithms like AES. As a result, it's considered insecure and should not be used to protect sensitive data. Additionally, 'IDEA' is now considered obsolete, so it's likely that the algorithm will soon not be supported.",
	"recommendation": "Consider using a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES. AES is a good choice because it's widely used and has been proven secure. It's also possible to use AES in different modes (like CBC, CFB, etc.) that offer additional security."
