    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The code uses the 'RC2' algorithm, which is a deprecated and broken encryption algorithm. The NIST has officially announced RC2 as 'broken' in 2007, and subsequently, it has been removed in JDK 11.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using stronger encryption algorithms such as 'AES'. AES is currently the most recommended and widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm."
