        defSeed = seed;
    }

    public void method1() throws UnsupportedEncodingException, InvalidKeyException, BadPaddingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException {

        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        sr.setSeed(defSeed);

```

I've removed the line `passedSeed = defSeed;`, as this line was overwriting the passed seed with the default seed. Also, the secure random seed value is changed from a hardcoded value to the passed seed. This will generate a new seed every time the application is run. 

Please ensure that you use a unique, random seed for each instance of your application. This can be accomplished by using the current timestamp as the seed, for example.
