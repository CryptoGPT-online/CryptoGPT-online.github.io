    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(passedAlgo);",
    "description": "The 'AES' algorithm is considered a weak cryptographic algorithm nowadays. Its security level is 128 bits, which is lower than some modern standards. Using weak cryptographic algorithms may cause information disclosure or other security problems.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using stronger cryptographic algorithms such as 'AES-256' or 'RSA'. If you still want to use 'AES', consider increasing its key size or use 'AES-256/CBC/PKCS7Padding' instead of 'AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding', which is a safer mode for 'AES'."
