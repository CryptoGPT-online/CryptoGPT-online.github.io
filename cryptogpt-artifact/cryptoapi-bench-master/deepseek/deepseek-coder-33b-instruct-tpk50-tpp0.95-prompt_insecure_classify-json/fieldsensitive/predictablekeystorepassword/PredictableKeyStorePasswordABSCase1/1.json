        "description": "In the method 'method1', the certificate from the URL 'https://www.google.com' is loaded into a KeyStore without any certificate validation. This is a major security concern because it can allow an attacker to load a malicious certificate and intercept the SSL/TLS connections.",
        "recommendation": "The certificate from the URL 'https://www.google.com' should be validated before it is loaded into the KeyStore. This can be done using a trust manager or similar mechanism to validate the certificate before loading it into the KeyStore."

        "description": "In the method 'method1', the KeyStore instance is instantiated using the 'JKS' type. This type is not secure because it's vulnerable to attacks such as Padding Oracle attacks and can expose sensitive data if it is not properly encrypted and secured.",
        "recommendation": "The 'KeyStore' instance should be created using a more secure type like 'PKCS12' or 'Windows-MY'. Alternatively, you can enable the secure random number generator (RNG) and use 'PKCS12' or 'Windows-MY' by default if there is no specific reason to use 'JKS'."

        "recommendation": "The 'key' should be replaced with a securely generated random key. The 'KeyGenerator' class in Java can be used to generate secure keys."
