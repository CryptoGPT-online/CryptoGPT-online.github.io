    "description": "The salt used for the encryption is hardcoded as 16 bytes. This is less secure than using a randomly generated salt. A shorter salt can make the hash shorter and hence easier to crack by brute force attack.",
    "recommendation": "For security purposes, use a salt length of at least 128 bits. If longer salt is used, it should be randomly generated for each encryption operation."

    "description": "The number of iterations for the password-based encryption is set to a relatively small number (11010). Also, the key length used is 16, which is considered a weak encryption strength. Weak encryption can be cracked more quickly and is therefore less secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, ideally around 10,000 or more. The key length should ideally be around 128 bits or larger."
