        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "new PBEKeySpec(passedPassword.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
        "description": "The iteration count (11010) is quite high, which could slow down the key generation process. Also, the key length is set to 16 bits which is less than the recommended minimum key length of 112 bits for PBKDF2. This can result in a weaker encryption strength, making the encryption susceptible to brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Set a higher iteration count and a suitable key length according to the encryption policy. 100,000 is the recommended iteration count, and 256 bits or more is recommended for key length in PBKDF2."
