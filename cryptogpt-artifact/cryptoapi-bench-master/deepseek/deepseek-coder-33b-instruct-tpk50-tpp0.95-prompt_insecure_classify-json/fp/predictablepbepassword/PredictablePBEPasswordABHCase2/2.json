Here are the vulnerabilities found and fixes applied:

1. Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
    * Description: Using an obsolete algorithm, such as PBEWithMD5AndDES, that has known vulnerabilities
    * Recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm, such as PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1.

2. Misuse: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
    * Description: The salt is initialized with all zeros
    * Recommendation: Use a random salt, initialized with a secure random number generator.

3. Misuse: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
    * Description: The iteration count is too low
    * Recommendation: Use a larger iteration count, ideally 10000 or more. 

4. Misuse: CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
    * Description: The password used is hardcoded in the map
    * Recommendation: Do not use hardcoded credentials. Use a secure storage for secrets.

Remember, for any cryptographic operation involving keys, it's crucial to handle them securely and not reveal them in the code.
