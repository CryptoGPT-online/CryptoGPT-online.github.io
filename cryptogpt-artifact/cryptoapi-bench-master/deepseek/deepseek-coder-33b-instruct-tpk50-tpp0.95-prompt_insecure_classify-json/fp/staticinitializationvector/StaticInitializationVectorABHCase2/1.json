byte [] bytes = name.getBytes();
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);
```

2. Insufficient Key Length:
The KeyGenerator uses the "AES" algorithm for generating keys. However, "AES" is just a set of rules that determines how to apply certain transformations to a plaintext using a small secret key. AES supports three key sizes: 128, 192, and 256 bits. The default implementation of the "AES" algorithm may use 128-bit keys. Using a smaller key size is considered less secure than using a larger key size.

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
```

Recommendation:
To enhance the security of this code, the following changes should be made:

1. The IV should be randomly generated for each encryption operation to make it more secure. A SecureRandom instance can be used to generate random bytes.

```java
SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
byte[] randomBytes = new byte[16];
secureRandom.nextBytes(randomBytes);
IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(randomBytes);
```

2. The key size should be increased to at least 128 bits to enhance security.

```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
keyGen.init(128); // Key size should be at least 128 bits
SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
```
