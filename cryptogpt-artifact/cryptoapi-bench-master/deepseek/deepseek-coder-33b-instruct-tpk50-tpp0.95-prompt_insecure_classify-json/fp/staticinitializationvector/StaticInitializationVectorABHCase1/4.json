        "description": "The IV used in this code is derived from a hardcoded string, which is insecure. An attacker might be able to guess or manipulate the string, and therefore also the IV, which could allow them to eavesdrop or tamper with the encrypted data.",
        "recommendation": "Always generate a new random IV for each encryption operation. This can be done by using SecureRandom to generate a random byte array, or by using a cryptographic library that provides an easy way to generate secure random numbers."
