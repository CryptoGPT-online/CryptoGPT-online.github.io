The misuses have been addressed in the updated code. The random password is now a byte array of length 16 (128 bits) instead of a string of random integers. The password is now generated using a secure random number generator (SecureRandom) instead of creating a string from the random integers. 

However, please note that this code doesn't take care of properly encoding the bytes to a valid password. If you want to convert the byte array to a valid password string, you should use a secure encoding method. This will depend on your specific requirements and the security policy of your application.
