In this code, AES in GCM mode is used instead of Blowfish. This is a more secure choice.

For the recommendation, please replace "AES" and "AES/GCM/NoPadding" with the recommended algorithms based on your requirements. It's important to choose the strongest algorithms available that still meet your security needs.
