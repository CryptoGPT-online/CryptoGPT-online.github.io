        "description": "The code is using the RC2 algorithm, which is a weak and deprecated cryptographic algorithm. RC2 is susceptible to a number of attacks, including meet-in-the-middle attacks and birthday attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using stronger cryptographic algorithms like AES. You can use the KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\") to get an AES key generator, and Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\") to get a Cipher instance that uses the AES algorithm in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding."

        "recommendation": "If you need to validate certificates, consider using standard Java libraries such as javax.net.ssl. If you're doing your own cryptography, you should implement certificate validation or at least have a good reason not to."
