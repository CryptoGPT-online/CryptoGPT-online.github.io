        "description": "The hostname in the certificate does not match the hostname of the server you are connecting to. This allows a potential man-in-the-middle attack.",
        "recommendation": "Always perform SSL/TLS hostname verification to ensure you are connecting to the correct server and prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. If this is not feasible, ensure that the server's certificate is trusted by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and that your system is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. If the server's certificate is self-signed, consider obtaining the server's certificate from a trusted source."
