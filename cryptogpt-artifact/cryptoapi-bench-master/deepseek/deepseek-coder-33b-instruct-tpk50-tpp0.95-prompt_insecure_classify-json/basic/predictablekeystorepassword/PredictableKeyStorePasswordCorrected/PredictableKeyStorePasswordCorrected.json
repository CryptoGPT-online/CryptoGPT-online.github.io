Based on the code and misuses list provided, here are the identified false positives:

### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

The misuse of random values is not a problem here, as the password is correctly generated from SecureRandom. However, the "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());" part could be considered as false positive due to the use of ints() instead of using a secure random generator, like nextBytes() or generateSeed() to generate a sufficiently long password.

2. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation

This misuse is not true since the KeyStore is being loaded from a URL, not during negotiation with another system. The URL used is 'https://www.google.com' which is not a KeyStore.
