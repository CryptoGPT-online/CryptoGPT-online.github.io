Analyzing the misuses:

The reported misuse `CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values` in the first part of the misuse list is not a false positive. The use of `nextInt` method without arguments in the SecureRandom instance returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value across all possible int values, which might not provide high enough entropy for secure uses. This could be a problem if the code is using the random number for sensitive security operations like generating cryptographic keys, tokens, or passwords where cryptographic randomness is required.

In the second part of the misuse list, the misuse `None` is a false positive. The provided vulnerable code snippet does not pose a cryptographic API misuse. It is correctly using the `SecureRandom` class and generating a random number.

The third part of the misuse list is also a false positive as there is no misuse to report.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, the misuse `CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values` is the only one that should be considered in the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses.
