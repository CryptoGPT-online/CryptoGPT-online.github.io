byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();

3. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The code uses the 'AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING' cipher. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a mode of operation for a block cipher, which may expose sensitive information if it is used in ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode which is not secure.

```java
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec);
```

The recommended fix for all these issues is to use a secure random generator for generating the key, a strong encryption algorithm, and use a secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM.
