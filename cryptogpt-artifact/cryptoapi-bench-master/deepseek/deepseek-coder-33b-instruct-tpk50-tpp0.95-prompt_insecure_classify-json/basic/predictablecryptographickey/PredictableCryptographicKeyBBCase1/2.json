Description: 
The encryption strength of AES is not sufficient. The standard for AES is AES-128 and AES-192, but this code uses a 16-byte key which is too short to be secure. AES-256 is recommended as it provides more security.

Recommendation:
Modify the code to use a 32-byte key for AES-256, or for maximum security, use a longer key, depending on your specific needs. If AES-256 is sufficient, then you could use a 32-byte key.
