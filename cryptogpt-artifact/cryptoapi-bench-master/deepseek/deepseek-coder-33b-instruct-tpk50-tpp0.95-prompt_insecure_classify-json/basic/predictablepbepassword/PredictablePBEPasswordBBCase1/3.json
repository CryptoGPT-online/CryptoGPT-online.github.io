    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code is using PBE (Password-Based Encryption) which is generally considered weak cryptographic algorithm due to its vulnerability against brute force attacks. Also, it uses a low number of iteration count (11010) and key length (16).",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which provides higher security. Additionally, increase the iteration count to at least 100,000 to slow down brute force attacks, and consider using a key length of at least 256 bits for high security."
