    "description": "The iteration count for PBKDF2 is very low, which could make the computation of the PBEKeySpec more efficient but less secure. The key length is also too short for many applications.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value that makes the computation of PBKDF2 hard to perform brute force attacks, and increase the key length to at least 16 bytes."
