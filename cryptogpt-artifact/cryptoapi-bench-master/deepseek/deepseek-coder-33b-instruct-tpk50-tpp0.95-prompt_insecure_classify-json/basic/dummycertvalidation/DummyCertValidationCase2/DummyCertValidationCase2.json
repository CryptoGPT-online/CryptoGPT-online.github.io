### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse about "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation" in the misuse list is a false positive. The code provided implements the checkServerTrusted() method in X509TrustManager which is responsible for server-side certificate validation. The misuse description and recommendation given in the list do not correspond with the actual implementation.

        "description": "The methods 'checkClientTrusted' and 'checkServerTrusted' are left blank, which means the trust manager will accept all certificates without any validation.",
