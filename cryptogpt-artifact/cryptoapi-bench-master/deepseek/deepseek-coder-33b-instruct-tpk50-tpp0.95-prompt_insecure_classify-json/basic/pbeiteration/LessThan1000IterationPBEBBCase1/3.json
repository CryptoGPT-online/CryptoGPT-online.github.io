        "description": "The salt used for PBE (Password-Based Encryption) is not being generated securely. The salt should ideally be randomly generated for each password, and should not be reused. It's currently using a SecureRandom instance to generate salt, but it's possible that this isn't providing enough entropy, leading to weaker randomness.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) instead of SecureRandom to generate the salt, to ensure that it provides a sufficient amount of randomness."

        "vulnerable_code": "int count = 20;",
        "description": "The count used for PBE is 20. This is a low number and weakens the encryption. The PBE iteration count is an important parameter for security, and a higher number means the hash function is iterated more times, creating a stronger encryption. The exact number depends on the security requirements of the application.",
        "recommendation": "Consider increasing the count to a higher number, depending on the security requirements of the application. A higher count would make the encryption stronger."
