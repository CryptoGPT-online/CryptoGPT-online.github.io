### False Positive Misuse ###
There appears to be one false positive in the misuses list. The misuse category for the description "PBE (Password-Based Encryption) with a low number of iterations is used for password hashing or encryption. This may lead to brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks, which could be risky." is "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", but in the actual vulnerable code, PBEParameterSpec object is being created but never used, which suggests a misuse of PBEParameterSpec object, not a misuse of the PBE algorithm itself. Therefore, this misuse should be considered as a false positive.

        "description": "The count used for PBE is 20. This is a low number and weakens the encryption. The PBE iteration count is an important parameter for security, and a higher number means the hash function is iterated more times, creating a stronger encryption.

        "recommendation": "Consider increasing the count to a higher number, depending on the security requirements of the application. A higher count would make the encryption stronger."
