## False Positives:
None of the listed misuses are false positives in this code. The code explicitly sets up a MessageDigest object using the SHA-256 algorithm, regardless of the 'choice' variable's value. Similarly, the 'name' variable is defined with a hardcoded string, which is not automatically considered as a vulnerability because the value is not a dynamically generated random value.
