[{
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "DES is a weak algorithm for encryption and should not be used for sensitive data encryption. It is often used in software because it's simple and available in Java but it has a 56-bit key size, which is considered short.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using an AES cipher. This will provide a more secure encryption than DES as it provides a 128-bit key size."
