[{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");",
    "description": "This code uses the Blowfish algorithm instead of AES. Blowfish is a strong algorithm but has a 64-bit block size, which is vulnerable to birthday attack and does not meet the key length requirement of AES.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using AES encryption algorithm for symmetric encryption. In Java, you can use `Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\")` to get AES encryption algorithm. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely used and considered secure."
