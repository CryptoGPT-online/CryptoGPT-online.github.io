  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\");",
  "description": "The chosen cipher (IDEA) is considered a weak cipher because IDEA, as a block cipher, is now considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for most current applications. It should be replaced with a secure, modern encryption algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).",
  "recommendation": "Replace 'IDEA' with 'AES'. If the cipher instance is dependent on user's choice, use a more secure encryption algorithm depending on the choice. For example, if choice > 1, then choose 'AES'."
