        "description": "In the provided code, the seed byte array is hardcoded and it contains constant values which might not be enough for creating secure random numbers. The 'nextBytes' method is used to set the seed of the SecureRandom object, which is known to have insufficiently random values.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using hardcoded byte values, consider generating a random seed array using a secure random number generator. This will ensure that the seed is sufficiently random and provides a more secure initialization for the SecureRandom object."

        "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextInt()",
        "description": "The code uses a seed-based SecureRandom object to generate a random integer. However, the seed is not necessarily secure because it can be easily predictable. This can expose the code to vulnerabilities, such as the possibility of predicting future random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure source of randomness such as java.security.SecureRandom. It generates a secure random number using a combination of the system's hardware random number generator, user-provided sources of randomness, and a PRNG to create a secure seed."
