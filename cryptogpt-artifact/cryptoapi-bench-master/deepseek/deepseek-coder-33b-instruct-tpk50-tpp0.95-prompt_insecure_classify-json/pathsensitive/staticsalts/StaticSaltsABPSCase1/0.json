  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "salt generation",
  "description": "The salt generation uses a fixed byte value {(byte) 0xa2}. In this case, if an attacker knows the input, it will be easier to guess the salt. This makes it less random and could be insecure for cryptographic applications.",
  "recommendation": "The salt should be randomly generated using SecureRandom to prevent attackers from guessing it. A high iteration count can also be used to slow down brute force attacks. However, the exact number will depend on the resources available for the application."
