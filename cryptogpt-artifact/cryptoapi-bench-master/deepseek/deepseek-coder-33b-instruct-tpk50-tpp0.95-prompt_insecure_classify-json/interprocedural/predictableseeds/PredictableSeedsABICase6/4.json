        "description": "SecureRandom is initialized with a byte array, which is potentially not secure, as it should be seeded with a larger, more random seed. It is also not guaranteed that the random number generator will have sufficient entropy and it can be predictable for the same seed.",
        "recommendation": "Use a better seed for SecureRandom. A seed should be as random as possible, possibly obtained from a cryptographic secure random number generator (RNG)."
