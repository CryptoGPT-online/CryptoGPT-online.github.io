        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed)",
        "description": "The use of SecureRandom with a weak or easily guessable seed weakens the encryption strength. In the given code, the seed is a static byte array with values [100, 200], which is not random and thus is easily guessable. This would make the generated random numbers less secure and less random.",
        "recommendation": "Use a much larger, truly random seed for SecureRandom. You could generate this seed by using SecureRandom itself. However, be aware that using a truly random seed for a security purpose could be expensive in terms of performance."
