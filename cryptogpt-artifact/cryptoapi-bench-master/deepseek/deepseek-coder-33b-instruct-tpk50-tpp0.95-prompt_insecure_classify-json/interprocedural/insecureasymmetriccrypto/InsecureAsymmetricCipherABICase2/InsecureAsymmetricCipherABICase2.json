This is the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "keysize = KEY_SIZE;",
        "description": "The key size for RSA key pair generation is set through a variable that can potentially be changed at runtime. This could lead to security issues.",
        "recommendation": "Use a constant value for the key size, or ensure that the key size is not easily changed at runtime."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");kgp.initialize(keysize);",
        "description": "The RSA encryption is used with a small key size (1024 bits). This is considered a weak encryption algorithm. This could allow attackers to decrypt the encrypted data easily. It is recommended to use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES with a key size of 256 bits or higher.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'RSA' with 'AES'. Also, increase the key size to at least 2048 bits."
    }
