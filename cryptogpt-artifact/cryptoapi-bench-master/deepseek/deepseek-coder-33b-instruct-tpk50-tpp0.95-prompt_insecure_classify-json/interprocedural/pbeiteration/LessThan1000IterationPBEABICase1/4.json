        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The salt for password-based encryption is generated using a static random function with no custom seed. This can lead to predictable salts and therefore can increase the risk of attacks using precomputed tables or rainbow tables.",
        "recommendation": "You should use a cryptographic secure random function to generate the salt, which should be different for each password you wish to hash. Alternatively, you can use a secure method to generate a random seed and use it to seed a random number generator."

        "description": "The PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) iteration count is set using an input that can be manipulated by the user. As the iteration count increases, so does the time and resources needed to compute the derived key. Excessively low iteration counts may expose the system to brute-force attacks. It is recommended to use a minimum iteration count of 1000.",
        "recommendation": "Always set the iteration count to a value no less than 1000. You may also consider using an iteration count that scales with the computational resources of the system so that it remains secure regardless of hardware upgrades."
