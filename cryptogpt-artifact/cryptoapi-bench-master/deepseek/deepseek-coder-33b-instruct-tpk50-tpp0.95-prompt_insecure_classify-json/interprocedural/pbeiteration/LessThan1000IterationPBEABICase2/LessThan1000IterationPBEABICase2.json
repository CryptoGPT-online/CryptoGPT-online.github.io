### False Positive Misuse ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "new PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)))",
        "description": "In this code, the PBEParameterSpec constructor is used with a salt and a repetition count. The repetition count is parsed from the string. If this string is not a valid integer, a NumberFormatException will occur. This could lead to misuses such as negative values or values larger than the Integer.MAX_VALUE.",
        "recommendation": "To prevent this misuse, ensure that the count is always a valid integer before passing it to the PBEParameterSpec constructor."

        "description": "The iteration count for the PBEParameterSpec is not generated randomly. The count is generated based on the value of the 'count' variable, which is set to the 'count' value from the go3() method, which was set in the go2() method. The count value is set as the result of transforming the DEFAULT_COUNT value to a char array in the go2() method, which is '20'. This leads to insecure encryption.",
