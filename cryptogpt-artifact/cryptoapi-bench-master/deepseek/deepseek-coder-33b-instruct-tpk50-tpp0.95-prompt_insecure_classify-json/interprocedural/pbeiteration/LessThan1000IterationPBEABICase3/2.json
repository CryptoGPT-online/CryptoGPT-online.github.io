{
  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
  "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
  "description": "The method `random.nextBytes(salt);` generates a random byte array for the salt. However, this salt is generated only once, which is insufficient as random values. Re-using or hard-coding the same salt for each operation under the same key can lead to vulnerabilities in cryptographic operations. In case of encryption using the same salt with the same key, an attacker can perform a chosen-plaintext attack.",
  "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, you should ensure the salt is generated each time the operation is performed. You can generate a new random salt for each operation, using the `SecureRandom` class or a secure source of randomness. If a salt needs to be reused, it should be stored securely and not be predictable or guessable."
