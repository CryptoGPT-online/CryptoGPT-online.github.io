byte[] salt = new byte[32];
random.nextBytes(salt);
```
Description: This code segment generates a salt using a fixed length of 32 bytes. Low-entropy salt could potentially lead to weaker cryptographic security.
Recommendation: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a salt with high entropy. The length of the salt should also be appropriate for the cryptographic algorithm being used.
