        "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The count variable is used as an argument for generating a salt. Since it is passed directly to the PBEParameterSpec constructor, it can be manipulated by users to change the encryption strength. This could be a potential security vulnerability.",
        "recommendation": "Do not directly use variables that can be controlled by users to set the strength of the encryption. Instead, use a fixed value or an algorithm that produces secure random numbers."
