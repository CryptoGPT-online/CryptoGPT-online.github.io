        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the cryptographic key. This can be done by using the 'getInstance(\"AES\", \"BC\")' method of KeyGenerator which uses the Bouncy Castle provider, which provides a strong random number generator. Alternatively, Java 9 or later versions come with a standardized random number generator."
