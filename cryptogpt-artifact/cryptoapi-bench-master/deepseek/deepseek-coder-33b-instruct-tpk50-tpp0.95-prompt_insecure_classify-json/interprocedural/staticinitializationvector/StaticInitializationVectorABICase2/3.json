        "description": "This code is using AES with CBC mode for encryption. CBC mode is not secure, it doesn't provide integrity and confidentiality. This mode is also vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. It would be better to use authenticated encryption like AES-GCM or EAX mode or to use a secure protocol like TLS.",

        "description": "In this code, the Initialization Vector (IV) is initialized with a static value. This IV should be randomly generated for each encryption operation to ensure that encrypting the same data twice doesn't yield the same ciphertext, which can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.",
