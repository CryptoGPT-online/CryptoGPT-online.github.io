The false positives are:

1. The recommendation to use stronger ciphers doesn't mention anything about ECB mode. The ECB mode is not inherently insecure but there are specific weaknesses and vulnerabilities with this mode such as patterns in the data that can be exploited. AES is also preferred for its more secure cipher modes like CBC or GCM.

2. There's no indication for padding recommendation.

3. There's no mention about any other certificate validation, which is an important aspect for secure communications.

4. There's no mention about key size. DES has a key length of 56 bits, which is considered small and unsafe for modern applications. AES, with its key lengths of 128 bits or more, is considered more secure.


Based on the context, these issues are not considered false positives. The code's misuse of cryptographic algorithms and weak encryption modes can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

Here is the optimized list:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(keyAlgo); \nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "DES and ECB are considered weak cryptographic algorithms. ECB is particularly insecure because it doesn't hide data patterns well. An attacker can distinguish the original plaintexts if the same plaintext block appears more than once in a message. Also, the key size of DES is considered small and unsafe for modern applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use AES with a secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM. Also consider increasing the key size to a minimum of 128 bits."
  }
]
```
