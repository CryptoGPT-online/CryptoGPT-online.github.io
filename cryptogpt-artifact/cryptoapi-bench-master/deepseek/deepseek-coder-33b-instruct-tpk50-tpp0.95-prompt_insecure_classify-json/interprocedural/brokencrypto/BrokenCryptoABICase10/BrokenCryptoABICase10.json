Based on the given misuses and the provided Java code, it can be inferred that the misuses are indeed false positives as the cryptographic algorithm used here is IDEA which is indeed a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. However, I will keep the misuse as it is since it is an important aspect of cryptography to use safe and recommended ciphers.

Below are the optimized lists of cryptographic API misuses:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The code is using the 'IDEA' cipher algorithm which is considered a weak and broken cipher algorithm. The IDEA algorithm has been replaced with other safer ciphers.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'IDEA' with a stronger and more secure cipher algorithm. Consider using 'AES' (Advanced Encryption Standard)."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The code is not using a secure random number generator to generate the encryption key. This makes it easier for an attacker to guess the encryption key.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the encryption key. In Java, this can be done with java.security.SecureRandom."
    }
]
```

In the second misuse, while the code does use an insecure algorithm, it also does not use a secure random number generator to generate the encryption key. To further improve the security of the application, we could add a SecureRandom object to generate a secure random key. This will ensure that the encryption key used is unpredictable, increasing the security of the data being encrypted.
