        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used (RC2) is considered a broken or risky algorithm. RC2 is vulnerable to numerous known attacks and its usage is discouraged due to the possibility of implementation errors that make it easy to create insecure code. Avoid RC2, use a modern standard algorithm like AES.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'RC2' with a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm. For example, 'AES' (AES/GCM/NoPadding in Java). Also, use a unique random key every time to prevent brute force attack."

        "description": "The code is using the Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto)) method which might involve certificate validation (depending on the transformation string value). However, there's no explicit certificate validation logic, which might indicate a lack of certificate validation or an improper implementation of it.",
