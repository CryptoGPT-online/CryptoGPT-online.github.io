### False Positive Misuse ###
{
    "misuse category": "Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();",
    "description": "This code sets the encryption algorithm as 'RC4' which is known to have cryptographic weaknesses.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm, like 'AES'. Always refer to the Java documentation for a list of suitable encryption algorithms."
}
The misuse is not applicable here, because this code is not used for encryption.
