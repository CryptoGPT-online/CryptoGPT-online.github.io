{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
  "description": "The cryptographic algorithm is hardcoded. This makes the system vulnerable to attacks because an attacker might be able to predict or guess the encryption algorithm used. This can be exploited to decrypt the data.",
  "recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded cryptographic algorithms. It is recommended to let the user or a system administrator configure the encryption algorithm. Always use a robust, well-established algorithm that is currently recommended for the use-case at hand. For instance, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) has been extensively scrutinized and proven to be secure. It's important to keep abreast of the latest advancements in cryptography and algorithms."
