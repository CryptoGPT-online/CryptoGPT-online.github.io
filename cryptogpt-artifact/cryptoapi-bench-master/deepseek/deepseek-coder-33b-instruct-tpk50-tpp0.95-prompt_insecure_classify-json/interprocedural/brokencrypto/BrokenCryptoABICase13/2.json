        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The cryptoAlgo can be controlled by a user input. This could be an issue if an attacker manages to control the input and select a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm. In this case, an attacker can easily decrypt the encrypted message with the chosen weak algorithm. RC4 is a weak cryptographic algorithm and it's not recommended to use it in real applications due to its vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid using broken or weak cryptographic algorithms. Use cryptographic standards such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)."
