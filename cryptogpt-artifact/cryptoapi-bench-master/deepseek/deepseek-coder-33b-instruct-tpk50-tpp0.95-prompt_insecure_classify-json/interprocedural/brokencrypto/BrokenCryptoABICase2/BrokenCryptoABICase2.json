After carefully reviewing the code and the provided misuses, the misuse regarding the use of the 'Blowfish' algorithm is indeed a false positive. Although Blowfish is a symmetric key block cipher, it is not considered secure anymore and the cryptographic community has agreed to deprecate it. Also, this code does not use the Blowfish algorithm. It uses 'AES' which is an acceptable and secure algorithm.

The second misuse regarding the use of Blowfish is also a false positive. Since Blowfish is being used for key generation and encryption, it would follow the false positive as well. 

The third misuse is a bit tricky, it says that the Blowfish algorithm has a weak key size. However, the code is using the Blowfish algorithm from its instance, not specifying the key size. Therefore, the misuse is actually not relevant in this code.

Therefore, the list of misuses should be optimized to the following:

```json
[]
```
