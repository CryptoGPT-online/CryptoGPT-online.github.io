  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\")",
  "description": "The code is using the RC2 cryptographic algorithm, which is known to have serious weaknesses and should not be used for secure encryption.",
  "recommendation": "Consider using stronger cryptographic algorithms such as AES or RSA for encryption. You can also look into using a proven encryption library that supports secure algorithms."
