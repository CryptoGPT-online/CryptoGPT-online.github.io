    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The key size for AES algorithm is 128 bits (16 bytes). Using less than 128 bits can be insecure. The provided code uses 16 bytes as the key size which is a very low security standard. It would be recommended to use 128 bits (16 bytes) for AES key size.",
    "recommendation": "Modify the code to use 128 bits (16 bytes) for AES key size. You can do this by replacing '16' with '16' in the line 'keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);'."
