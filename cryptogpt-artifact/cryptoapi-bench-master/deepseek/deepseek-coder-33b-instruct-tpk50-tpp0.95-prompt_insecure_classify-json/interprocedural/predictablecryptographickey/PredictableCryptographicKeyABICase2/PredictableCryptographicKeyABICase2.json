### False Positive Misuse ###

1. `CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values`: The encryption key is being created from a string which is not random. If this string is leaked, the encryption key will also be leaked.
    * The vulnerability lies in `ENCRYPT_KEY = DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY.toCharArray();` where the encryption key is directly derived from a string which is not random.
    * The misuse is False Positive because `DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY` is hard-coded, but it is not part of the provided code, which shows that the misuse is not applicable to the provided code.
