As an auditor, it's not always possible to determine whether a reported misuse is a false positive or not, especially when dealing with complex, real-world code. However, I can attempt to analyze and confirm the misuses here based on the provided code and misuses.

In the provided code, there's a false positive reported for "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation." This misuse seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the concept. In the provided code, the crypto algorithm is not being negotiated or chosen by the program, it's set in stone by a private field. Thus, "CWE-295" does not apply in this code.

For "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation." it's not entirely accurate. Although the crypto algorithm name is stored in plain text (public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = "MD4";), it's only transferred to `crypto` which is stored in a char array and not used in the context where it could be changed or influenced by an attacker. Thus, this misuse does not apply in this code.

Regarding the actual misuses, the reported misuse for "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values." is also misleading as it doesn't apply here. The code uses an obsolete cryptographic algorithm like MD4 which can be considered less secure, but it's not the same as less random values. "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" also doesn't apply because all cryptographic algorithms used here (MD4, SHA-256) have sufficient strength for most use cases.

However, the misuse for "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm." is accurate. MD4 is known to have weaknesses and it's recommended to use more secure algorithms instead.

Based on the above analysis, the misuses that apply to this code are:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The use of an obsolete and potentially broken cryptographic algorithm such as 'MD4'.",
    "recommendation": "Use more secure algorithms like 'SHA-256', 'SHA-3', or at least consider 'SHA-1' which is currently considered secure."
  }
]
```
