  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": 
  ```java
    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));
  ```,
  "description": "The code uses the 'crypto' variable as the input to the MessageDigest.getInstance() method, which accepts a String representing the name of the algorithm to use. In this case, it is taking 'MD2' as input, which is a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm as MD2 is considered insecure due to vulnerabilities and weaknesses. An attacker can exploit these weaknesses to decrypt the hash.",
  "recommendation": "You should not use MD2 for cryptographic operations and you should always use a strong, robust cryptographic algorithm. Consider using algorithms such as SHA-256, SHA-3, or a modern and secure algorithm like Bcrypt or PBKDF2."
