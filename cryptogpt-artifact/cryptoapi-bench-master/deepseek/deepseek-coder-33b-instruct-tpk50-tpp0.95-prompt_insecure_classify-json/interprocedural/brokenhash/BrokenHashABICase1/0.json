    "description": "The code is using SHA-1 which is weak and considered broken by the industry. It may be vulnerable to collision attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure cryptographic hash function like SHA-256 or SHA-3. Additionally, for password hashing, consider using bcrypt or similar algorithms. This will provide a balance between security and usability."
