        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in this code is the MD4. MD4 is a hashing function that is no longer considered secure, even when used with salt. This is because of the possibility of collision attacks, where an attacker could generate two different inputs that hash to the same output.",
        "recommendation": "You should not use the MD4 algorithm for cryptographic purposes. Consider using SHA-256 or a more recent hash function that is both stronger and more secure. Additionally, always use a salt when hashing passwords to further protect against brute force and rainbow table attacks."
