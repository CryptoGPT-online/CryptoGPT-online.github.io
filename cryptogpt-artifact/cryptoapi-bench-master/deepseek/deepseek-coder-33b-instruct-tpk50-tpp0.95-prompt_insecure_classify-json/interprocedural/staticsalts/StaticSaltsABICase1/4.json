    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "The salt value is hardcoded to a specific value here, which decreases the randomness of the derived key. This may lead to vulnerability of brute force attacks. This is considered a weak source of randomness, and it is better to use a secure random number generator (RNG) to generate a salt value. This code can be improved by using SecureRandom to create a random salt value.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the hardcoded salt value with a randomly generated one, using a secure random number generator. Here is an example of how to do it:\n\nSecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[16];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);"
