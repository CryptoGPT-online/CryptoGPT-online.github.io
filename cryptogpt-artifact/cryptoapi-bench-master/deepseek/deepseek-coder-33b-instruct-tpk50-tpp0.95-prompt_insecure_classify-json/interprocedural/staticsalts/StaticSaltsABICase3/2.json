        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2}; int count = 1020;",
        "description": "The salt length is only one byte, and the iteration count is a very high number which may increase the risk of brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using longer salts and adjusting the iteration count according to the strength needed for your specific situation. A good starting point is 10,000 iterations for PBE."
