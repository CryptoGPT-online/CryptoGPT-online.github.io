        "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to a low value (11010). This is less than the recommended value of 10000 which is often used in modern cryptographic standards. Similarly, the key length is set to 16 which is less than the recommended value of 256 bits for PBE algorithms. The resulting PBE key is weak and less secure.",
        "recommendation": "Consider setting a higher iteration count (e.g. 10000) and a higher key length (e.g. 256). This will increase the time and resources required to perform a brute force attack."
