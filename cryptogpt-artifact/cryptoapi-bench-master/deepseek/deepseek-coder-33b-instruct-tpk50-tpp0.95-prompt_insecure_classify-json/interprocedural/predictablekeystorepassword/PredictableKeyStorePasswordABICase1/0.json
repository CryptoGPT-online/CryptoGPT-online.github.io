        "description": "In this code, the key store type is hardcoded to 'JKS'. However, 'JKS' is a legacy algorithm and not recommended anymore. If the JKS keystore is replaced with another type, such as 'PKCS12', it can offer more robust security.",

Instead of a secure key store file, this could be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and it could lead to the misuse of an incorrect or compromised certificate. Furthermore, if Google changes its certificate, this URL would stop working, causing a security risk.",
