### False Positive Misuse ###

The first misuse reported in the first list, "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", in fact is a false positive in the given code. The code is using "TLS" (rather than "SSL") in SSLContext.getInstance() method, which does not trigger this misuse.
