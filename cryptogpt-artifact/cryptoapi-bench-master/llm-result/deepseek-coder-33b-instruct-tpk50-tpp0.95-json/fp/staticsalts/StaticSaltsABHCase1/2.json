        "description": "The code uses a weak key derivation function because it directly uses a user-provided value as a salt, without any hash or similar protection against salt exposure. This can lead to vulnerability if an attacker can get the input of the function.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure way to generate salt. It can be random and stored together with the hash or derived from a password with a password-based derivation function."
