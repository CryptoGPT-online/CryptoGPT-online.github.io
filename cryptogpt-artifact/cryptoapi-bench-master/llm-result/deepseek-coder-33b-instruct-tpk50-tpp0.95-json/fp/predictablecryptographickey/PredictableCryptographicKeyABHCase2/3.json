        "vulnerable_code": "new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
        "description": "The SecretKeySpec constructor takes a string which is converted to bytes using the default platform encoding. The resulting SecretKeySpec can vary depending on the platform's default encoding, which may lead to unexpected results or potential security issues.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using the platform's default encoding, specify the encoding explicitly. For example, you can use key.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII) to convert the string to bytes using the US-ASCII encoding. Also, consider using a key derivation function, which can generate a key of the required size from a password or passphrase, rather than converting a short string directly to a key."
