        "description": "The method 'random.ints()' generates random ints, which are then converted to a string. This may not produce a secure key as the string representation may not include all possible characters. The string is then used to generate the AES key, which may not provide the desired security level.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper algorithm or method to generate keys. A common approach is to use 'SecureRandom' to generate a byte array, and then to convert that byte array to a hex or base64 encoded string. This provides a secure random key of the desired length."

However, if the algorithm is hard-coded, you will have to replace the entire implementation, which is not desirable.",
