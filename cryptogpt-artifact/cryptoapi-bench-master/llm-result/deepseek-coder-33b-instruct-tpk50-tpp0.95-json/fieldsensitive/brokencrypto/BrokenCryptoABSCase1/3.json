        "description": "The algorithm specified for the cipher instance (DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding) is not considered secure and is not recommended for encryption in modern applications. DES is a weak block cipher and has known security flaws such as effective key search attacks and differential cryptanalysis. ECB mode is also not recommended for encryption as it lacks diffusion which may lead to patterns in the encrypted message that can be exploited. PKCS5Padding is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",

Additionally, a secure key management solution should be in place to manage and protect the keys used for encryption."
