"description": "Salt is used in cryptographic functions to prevent dictionary attacks or precomputed attacks. When no salt is used, if an attacker knows the plaintext and ciphertext pairs they can easily guess the key by XORing the two. ", 
"recommendation": "Consider using a strong random salt of at least 16 bytes. Each time you use the function, a new salt should be generated."
