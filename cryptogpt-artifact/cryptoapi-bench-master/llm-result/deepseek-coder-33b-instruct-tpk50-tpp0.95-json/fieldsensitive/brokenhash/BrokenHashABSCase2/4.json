    "description": "The use of MD5 is considered weak. The strength of MD5 has been debated for many years, and there are no known attacks against it, but it should not be used for any cryptographic security related purposes. It is now considered a legacy algorithm and its use is discouraged.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger hashing algorithm like SHA-256, SHA-3, or even bcrypt."
