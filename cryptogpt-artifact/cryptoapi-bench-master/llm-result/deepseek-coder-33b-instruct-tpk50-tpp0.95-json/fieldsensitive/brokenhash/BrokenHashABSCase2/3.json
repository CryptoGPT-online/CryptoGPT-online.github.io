"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The MD5 hash algorithm is considered to be weak and not recommended for most cryptographic uses due to known vulnerabilities. Using such an algorithm can potentially expose sensitive information in a way that can be exploited.",
"recommendation": "Consider using a stronger algorithm that provides similar security, such as SHA-256. Alternatively, you may want to look into using a proven library or built-in function for generating hashes or message authentication codes to ensure security and reliability."
