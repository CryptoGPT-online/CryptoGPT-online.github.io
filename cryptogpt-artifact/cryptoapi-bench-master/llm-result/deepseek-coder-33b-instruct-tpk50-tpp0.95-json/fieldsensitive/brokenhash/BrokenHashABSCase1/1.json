        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used, SHA1, is a weak hashing algorithm that is vulnerable to collision attacks and pre-image attacks. This makes it vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can generate two different inputs that have the same hash output, and where an attacker can modify an input to a different output.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use stronger cryptographic algorithms such as SHA-256, SHA-3, Bcrypt, or Scrypt for password hashing or any hash based operation."
