    "description": "RC2 is a weak algorithm that's been publicly compromised. Weak algorithms like RC2 or RC4 have been known to be insecure for many years. They're also widely deprecated in the industry. They should not be used in modern applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a modern, tested and secure algorithm like AES. Make sure to also update the key size if necessary, AES requires a 128-bit key, 192-bit key, or 256-bit key as per standard."
