    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(choice>1?\"SHA-256\":\"MD2\");",
    "description": "The choice variable can either be less than or greater than 1. If it is greater than 1, the SHA-256 algorithm is used. However, MD2 is a known weak hash algorithm with known vulnerabilities. This means that an attacker could potentially discover how the hash was created and can, therefore, break the hash.",
    "recommendation": "To improve security, it is recommended to only use secure hash functions. If you need compatibility with existing systems that only support MD2, consider using it only when the choice is less than or equal to 1."
