        "description": "The salt value is deterministically chosen based on the constant byte value, meaning it is not secure enough for cryptographic purposes. If the choice is greater than 1, the salt is overwritten with a new, random value, which could be insecure if the choice value is predictable or controlled by an attacker.",
