    "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode does not provide any kind of data security. The same plaintext block always encrypts to the same ciphertext block, which makes the encryption of the messages predictable and vulnerable to a variety of cryptanalytic attacks.",
    "recommendation": "It is highly recommended to use authenticated encryption modes like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter), which provide confidentiality and integrity."
