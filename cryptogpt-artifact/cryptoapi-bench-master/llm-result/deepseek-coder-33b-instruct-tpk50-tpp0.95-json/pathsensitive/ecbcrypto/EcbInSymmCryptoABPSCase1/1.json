        "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "The choice to use AES in CBC mode to encrypt the data depends on a parameter 'choice' which can be controlled by the user. Even though the CBC mode is secure, the 'choice' variable could be controlled by an attacker, potentially enabling them to inject malicious data into the encryption process.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a secure and reliable algorithm and mode of operation, such as AES in CBC mode. In any case, ensure the choice of algorithm and mode of operation is not influenced by user input to avoid injection of malicious data."
