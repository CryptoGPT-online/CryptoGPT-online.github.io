    "description": "The code is generating RSA keys. Although the keysize is set dynamically and doesn't reveal any insecure usage, it's considered insecure to use RSA without OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) for symmetric key encryption. OAEP is a padding scheme for RSA encryption that addresses various security concerns that arise in a direct application of RSA to encrypt data for symmetric encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Replace \"RSA\" with \"RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding\" or \"RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding\". This will make the code safer by applying a padding scheme to the RSA encryption."
