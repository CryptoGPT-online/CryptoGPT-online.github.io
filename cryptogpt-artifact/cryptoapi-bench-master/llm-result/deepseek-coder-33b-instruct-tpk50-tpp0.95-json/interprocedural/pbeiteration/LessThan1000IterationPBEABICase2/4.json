        "description": "The count parameter in PBEParameterSpec constructor should never be derived from an user-controlled input such as `count`, because it specifies the iteration count when generating the cipher, which may lead to unintended behavior if it is not correctly validated or properly sanitized. Furthermore, the usage of String.valueOf() is not necessary in this context. `count` is a char array, not a single char.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the `count` from the input to PBEParameterSpec, or if it must be included, consider using a constant or static value for security. If it must come from user input, ensure that the input is properly sanitized and validated."
