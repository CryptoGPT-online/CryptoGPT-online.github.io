    "description": "The code instantiates a KeyGenerator and a Cipher with a hardcoded cryptographic algorithm ('IDEA') which is considered a weak cryptographic algorithm and could be subject to cryptographic attacks. It is strongly recommended to avoid using such outdated and insecure algorithms for encryption, and always use up-to-date and secure algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Update the cryptographic algorithm to a more secure one such as 'AES'. Also, consider using higher security level keys. Use KeyGenerator.init(int keysize) or KeyPairGenerator.initialize(int keysize)."
