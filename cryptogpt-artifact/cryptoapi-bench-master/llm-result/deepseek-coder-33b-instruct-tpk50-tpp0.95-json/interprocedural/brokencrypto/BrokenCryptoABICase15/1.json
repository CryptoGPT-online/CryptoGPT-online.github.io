    "description": "The use of 'IDEA' as a cryptographic algorithm is not recommended due to various known attacks and limitations. 'IDEA' is now considered weak by most cryptographic experts and not recommended for general use. In Java, you can use 'AES', 'Blowfish', 'DES', 'DESede', 'RSA', 'HmacMD5', or 'HmacSHA256' instead.",
