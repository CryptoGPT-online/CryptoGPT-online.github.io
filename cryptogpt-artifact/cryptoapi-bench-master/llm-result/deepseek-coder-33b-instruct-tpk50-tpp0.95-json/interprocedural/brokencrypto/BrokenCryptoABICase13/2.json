        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in the code, RC4, is considered insecure. RC4's key length is static (64 bits), making it vulnerable to many attacks including the FMS attack.",
        "recommendation": "It is highly recommended to use a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES. AES is a strong encryption algorithm that is widely recommended for most uses. Alternatively, you may choose a stronger form of RC4, such as RC4-drop[n]. Remember to always use a secure random number generator to generate the keys."
