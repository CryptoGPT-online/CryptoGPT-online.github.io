        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used here is ECB, which is an insecure algorithm due to the risk of leaking information. When the same blocks of plaintext produce the same ciphertext, it makes the encryption system vulnerable to pattern recognition attacks. This makes ECB mode of operation insecure.",
