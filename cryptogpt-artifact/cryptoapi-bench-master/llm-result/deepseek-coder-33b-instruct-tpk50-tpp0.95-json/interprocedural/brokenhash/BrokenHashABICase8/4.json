This algorithm is no longer considered secure for most purposes, and may be vulnerable to attack if security is a concern. It is recommended to use stronger algorithms such as SHA-256, SHA-3 or Bcrypt in the modern cryptography standards.",
        "recommendation": "Replace \"MD2\" with \"SHA-256\" or any stronger algorithm available in the Java's built-in MessageDigest algorithms. Also, the code needs a default algorithm to fall back to in case the crypto variable is not properly initialized or is null."
