        "description": "The crypto string is directly controlled by user input. Using a weak cryptographic algorithm such as MD2 can lead to serious security vulnerabilities. MD2 is a 128-bit cryptographic hash function that can lead to collision attacks and pre-image attacks, which can be exploited by malicious users.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using the weak cryptographic algorithm, use a stronger one, such as SHA-256. Here is an example of how to use SHA-256: MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");"
