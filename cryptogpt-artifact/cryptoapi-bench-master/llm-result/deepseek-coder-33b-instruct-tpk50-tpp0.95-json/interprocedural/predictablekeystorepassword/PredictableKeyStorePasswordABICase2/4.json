    "description": "The cryptographic key is hardcoded in the code which is a major security weakness. If an attacker were to get access to the code or the binary, they would have the key and they could decrypt the data encrypted with the key.",
    "recommendation": "Do not hardcode cryptographic keys in the code. Store them in secure storage and access them at runtime. It is also recommended to use secure methods of accessing such keys to avoid hardcoding them."
