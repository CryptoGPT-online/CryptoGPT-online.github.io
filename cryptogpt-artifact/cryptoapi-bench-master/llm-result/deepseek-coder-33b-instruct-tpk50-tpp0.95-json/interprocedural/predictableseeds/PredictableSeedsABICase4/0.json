    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class's constructor takes a byte array as an argument. However, in this code, we are passing a byte array containing a single element that is obtained from `seed` array which is a character array (char[]). This leads to incorrect conversion of characters to bytes, as characters are encoded in UTF-8.",
    "recommendation": "Use the default seed directly as byte or convert the seed to a string and then to a byte array."
