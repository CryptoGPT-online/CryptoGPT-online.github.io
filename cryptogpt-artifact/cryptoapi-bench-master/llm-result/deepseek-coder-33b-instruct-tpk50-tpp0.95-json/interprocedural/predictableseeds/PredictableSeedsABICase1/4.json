    "description": "The seed value used in the SecureRandom class is an array of bytes. This might be insecure because it's easily predictable. The use of a seed that is not unique or random may compromise the security of the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a unique or randomly generated seed value when using SecureRandom. In case of a non-unique seed, it should be combined with a unique element such as the current system time. For example, you can use System.currentTimeMillis() or System.nanoTime(). However, note that using the current time as a seed in cryptographic applications can lead to predictable values, which can be exploited."
