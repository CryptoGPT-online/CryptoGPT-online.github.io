        "description": "The use of SecureRandom with a seed is not recommended because it can be predictable. The seed can be calculated by an attacker who can observe the same seed being used multiple times. This can expose the internal state of the random number generator which may lead to security vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without seeding. SecureRandom should be seeded from a secure random value which can be generated using java.security.SecureRandom. This is typically more secure and avoids the problem of seed predictability."
