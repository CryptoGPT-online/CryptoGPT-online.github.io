        "description": "The code uses a key generator to generate a key for AES encryption. This is considered insecure because the KeyGenerator.getInstance() method uses the default random number generator, which is not secure and might be predictable. A better way is to use a secure random number generator or a key derivation function that generates random keys.",
        "recommendation": "You should replace the line 'KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");' with 'KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", \"BC\");' to use the Bouncy Castle provider, which has a secure random number generator. Or you can use KeyGenerator.init(int keysize, SecureRandom random) method to provide your own SecureRandom instance."
