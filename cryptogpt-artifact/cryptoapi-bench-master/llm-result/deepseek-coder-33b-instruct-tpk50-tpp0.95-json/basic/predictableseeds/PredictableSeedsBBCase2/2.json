    "description": "The code uses SecureRandom with a provided seed stored in a byte variable. However, the byte array provided to the constructor only contains one element. This leads to reduced randomness and predictability.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using user-provided or time-based seeds as a seed for a random number generator. Instead, use a secure random number generator to generate the seed. If a seed needs to be used, ensure it is a sufficiently large random value and stored securely."
