[{    "misuse": "Weak PBE key",    "vulnerable_code": "new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength)",    "description": "The provided iterationCount and keyLength values make the key derivation process slower, which can reduce the overall security of the key. This is a weak PBE key and weakens the system's security.",    "recommendation": "Consider increasing the iterationCount and using a larger keyLength value. It's recommended to use 10000 as a base value and increase or decrease based on the computational resources available for the application."  }]
