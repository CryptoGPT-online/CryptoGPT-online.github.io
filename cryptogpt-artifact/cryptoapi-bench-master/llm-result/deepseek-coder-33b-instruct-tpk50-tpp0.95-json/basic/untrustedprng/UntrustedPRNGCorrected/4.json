        "description": "Using SecureRandom when it doesn't meet a particular entropy requirement could lead to predictable values. When no seed is provided, the SecureRandom constructor uses data such as the current time or CPU temperature to generate a seed. If an attacker knows this data, they could predict the seed and, therefore, the random number. This can lead to vulnerabilities in systems relying on random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a suitable seed (e.g., from a key derivation function) when generating random numbers for security-critical operations."
