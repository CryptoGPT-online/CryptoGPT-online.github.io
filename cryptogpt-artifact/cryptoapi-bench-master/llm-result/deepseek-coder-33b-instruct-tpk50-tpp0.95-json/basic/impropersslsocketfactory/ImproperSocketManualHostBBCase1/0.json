    "recommendation": "It is recommended to create a custom SSLContext and initialize an SSLSocketFactory with it. This ensures that the SSLSocketFactory is fully configured with all necessary security settings."

In general, always ensure to configure your SSLSocketFactory correctly and to verify server certificates in a secure manner. Additionally, don't ignore SSL certificate validity as this can expose your application to man-in-the-middle attacks.
