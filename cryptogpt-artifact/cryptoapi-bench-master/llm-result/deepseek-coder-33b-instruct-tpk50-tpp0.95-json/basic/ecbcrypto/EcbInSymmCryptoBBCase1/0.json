    "description": "Using KeyGenerator.getInstance with AES as the parameter, without a secure randomness, creates a key that may be weak and predictable. This poses a high risk to the security of the encrypted data.", 
    "recommendation": "AES requires a key with a certain length (128 bits for AES-128, 192 bits for AES-192, and 256 bits for AES-256). If no key is explicitly set, you should generate it securely. You can use SecureRandom to generate a secure random number."
