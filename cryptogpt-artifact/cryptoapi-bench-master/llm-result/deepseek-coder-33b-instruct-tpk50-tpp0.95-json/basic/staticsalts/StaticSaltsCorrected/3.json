  "description": "The use of a low iteration count when generating a Password-Based Encryption (PBE) key can make the key generation process vulnerable to timing attacks. This could allow an attacker to identify the time taken to compute the key, potentially discovering the key itself.",
  "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count. It is generally recommended to use at least 1000. Consider setting this value through a configuration file or environment variable, allowing it to be easily changed during system testing and deployment without code changes."
