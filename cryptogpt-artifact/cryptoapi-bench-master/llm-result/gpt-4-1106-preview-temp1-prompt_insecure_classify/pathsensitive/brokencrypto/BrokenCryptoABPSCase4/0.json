        "description": "The code selects the RC2 algorithm when 'choice' is not greater than 1, which is considered less secure due to its 64-bit block size and vulnerabilities to modern cryptanalysis.",
        "recommendation": "Always use strong cryptographic algorithms such as AES with secure modes and padding schemes. Remove the RC2 option."

        "description": "The AES key generator does not specify the key size, and it may default to a lower key size like 128 bits, which is considered secure but not the most secure option available.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly when generating the AES key to ensure adequate encryption strength. For example, use 'keyGen.init(256);' to initialize the key generator with a 256-bit key size."
