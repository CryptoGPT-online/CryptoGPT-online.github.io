        "description": "The iteration count 'count' for PBEParameterSpec is set to a low value when 'choice' is not greater than 1. Even though it is later set to 1050, the initial value might not provide sufficient protection against brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the iteration count is set to a sufficiently high number to provide adequate security, such as at least 10000 iterations."
