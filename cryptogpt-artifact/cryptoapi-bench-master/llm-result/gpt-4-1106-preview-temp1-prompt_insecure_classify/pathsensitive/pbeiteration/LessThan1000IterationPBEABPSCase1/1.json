        "vulnerable_code": "int count = 5;",
        "description": "The iteration count 'count' is initially set to a very low number (5) which is not secure enough. Although it is later conditionally set to 1050, the use of a low iteration count can lead to inadequate encryption strength.",
        "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count for key derivation. The count should be as high as possible without causing unreasonable delay. Typically, a minimum of 10,000 iterations is recommended."
