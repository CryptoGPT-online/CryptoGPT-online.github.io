        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "int count = 5;",
        "description": "The iteration count 'count' is initially set to a very low number (5). Although it is conditionally increased to 1050, which may still not be sufficient, the low initial value indicates a misunderstanding or potential misuse of iteration counts in password-based encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count for PBEParameterSpec that is currently accepted as secure by industry standards (e.g., at least 10,000 iterations)."
