        "description": "The seed is being reused and nextBytes is called with a predictable seed array that can compromise the randomness of SecureRandom. If 'choice' is always greater than 1, this code will always use the same seed, which makes the output predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the manual seeding or ensure that the seed is unpredictable and has sufficient entropy."

        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
        "description": "The hardcoded seed is of inadequate length and provides low entropy, making it susceptible to attacks. The use of hardcoded seed values also poses a security risk.",
        "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without a seed to allow the system to produce an adequately strong seed, or generate a seed with high entropy."
