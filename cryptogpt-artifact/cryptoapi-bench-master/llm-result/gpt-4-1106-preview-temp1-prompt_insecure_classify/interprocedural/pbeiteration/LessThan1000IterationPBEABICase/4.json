        "description": "The iteration count 'count' is set to a fixed value of 100000. While this value is not necessarily low, best practice suggests that the iteration count should be set as high as possible based on the performance constraints of the system to increase the cost of brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Determine the highest iteration count possible within the performance constraints of the system and set the iteration count to that value."
