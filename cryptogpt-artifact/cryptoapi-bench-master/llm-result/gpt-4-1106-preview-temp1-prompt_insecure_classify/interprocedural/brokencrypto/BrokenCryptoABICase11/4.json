        "description": "The code is using DES which is considered to be an outdated encryption algorithm with a key size of 56 bits that can be brute-forced by modern hardware.",

        "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode is used for encryption, which is not secure because it does not provide serious message confidentiality and can leak information about the plaintext.",
