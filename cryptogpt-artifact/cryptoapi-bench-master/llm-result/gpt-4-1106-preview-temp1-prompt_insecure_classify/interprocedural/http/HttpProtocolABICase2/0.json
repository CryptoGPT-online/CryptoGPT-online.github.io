The code provided does not appear to involve any cryptographic operations or crypto API usage. The class `H2` is simply performing string (URL) manipulations and does not include any cryptography related code. Therefore, there are no cryptography-related misuses to categorize under the provided CWEs. The function `go()` may have an issue with `url.toString()` as it will not provide the expected string representation of the URL but this is not related to cryptography, hence there are no misuses to report based on the provided categories.
