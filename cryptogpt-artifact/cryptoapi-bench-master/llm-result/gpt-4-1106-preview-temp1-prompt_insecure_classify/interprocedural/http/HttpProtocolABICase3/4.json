There are no cryptographic API uses in the provided code snippet, thus there are no instances of crypto API misuse. The code provided is a simple Java program that defines a URL string, then passes that string through a chain of methods, eventually constructing a `java.net.URL` object and printing it to the console.

Since the provided code does not involve any cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, random number generation, or certificate validation, it is not possible to identify any crypto API misuses as per the specified CWE categories.

If you have code that involves cryptographic operations and you'd like it to be analyzed, please provide the relevant code snippet.
