        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "AES with ECB mode (Electronic Codebook) is considered insecure for sensitive data because identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks, leading to pattern leakage.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure chaining mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) with a unique initialization vector for each encryption, or even better, use an authenticated encryption mode like GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) that provides both confidentiality and integrity."

        "recommendation": "Explicitly initialize the KeyGenerator with a SecureRandom instance and specify a key size (e.g., 256 bits for AES) to ensure sufficient randomness and key strength."
