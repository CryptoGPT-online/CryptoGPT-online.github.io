        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
        "description": "The code is initializing a SecureRandom object with a predictable seed. Using a predictable seed for a SecureRandom instance makes the generated random numbers predictable, which is not secure.",
        "recommendation": "Do not provide a seed to the SecureRandom constructor unless it is necessary and you are sure the seed is secure and unpredictable. Usually, it's better to let SecureRandom self-seed with entropy from the underlying operating system."
