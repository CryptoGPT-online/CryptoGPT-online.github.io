        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
        "description": "Manually seeding the SecureRandom instance with a predictable seed or with insufficient entropy can lead to predictable random values, which can be exploited by attackers to reduce the randomness of the values produced by the SecureRandom instance.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting the seed manually or ensure that the seed has sufficient entropy. It is typically better to allow SecureRandom to self-seed from a high-entropy source that the underlying operating system provides."
