        "description": "The use of a static seed value can lead to a predictable sequence of numbers from the SecureRandom instance, which reduces randomness and can make cryptographic operations vulnerable to attack.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting a fixed seed unless it is necessary for reproducing a sequence of secure random numbers. Allow SecureRandom to self-seed with entropy from the underlying operating system."
