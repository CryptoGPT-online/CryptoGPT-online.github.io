        "description": "The use of a set, static seed value for SecureRandom may result in predictable random values, which could be leveraged in certain attacks to reduce the randomness of the values produced by the SecureRandom instance.",
        "recommendation": "Do not set a static seed for SecureRandom; allow it to use its default seeding mechanism which is designed to be secure. If a seed is necessary, ensure it is generated using a secure and unpredictable source."

        "recommendation": "Ensure that seed values have sufficient length and entropy, ideally by using a cryptographic-strength random number generator to produce the seed. Avoid hardcoding seed values."
