        "description": "Setting the seed of SecureRandom to a known value can lead to predictable outputs from the random number generator, which is not suitable for cryptographic operations where unpredictability is required.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting a fixed seed for SecureRandom when used for cryptographic purposes. If a seed is necessary, ensure it is derived from a highly unpredictable source."

        "description": "The seed used for the SecureRandom instance is very short (only 2 bytes), which does not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Use a longer and more complex seed for SecureRandom. It's typically unnecessary to set the seed manually; SecureRandom is designed to seed itself from a high-entropy source provided by the operating system."
