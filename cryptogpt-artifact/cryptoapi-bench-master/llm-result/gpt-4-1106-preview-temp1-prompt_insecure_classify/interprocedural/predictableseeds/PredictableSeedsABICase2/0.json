        "description": "The random number generator is seeded with a single, static byte, which provides insufficient entropy for secure random number generation. This makes the output predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the static seed or provide a more secure seeding mechanism that offers sufficient entropy, such as calling 'SecureRandom' without a seed parameter so it will use the default system-provided entropy source."
