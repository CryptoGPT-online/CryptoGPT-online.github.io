The provided code snippet does not include any cryptographic API usage. It simply defines a class with a `main` method that assigns a URL to a string variable and then calls a `go` method with this URL. The `go` method prints the URL to the console using `System.out.println`.

Since there are no cryptographic operations or certificate validations taking place in the code, none of the mentioned Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) related to crypto API misuses apply. 

Therefore, there are no crypto API misuses to report in the provided code snippet.
