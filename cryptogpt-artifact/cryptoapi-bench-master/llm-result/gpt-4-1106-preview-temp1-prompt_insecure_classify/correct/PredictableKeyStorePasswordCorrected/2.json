        "description": "Using a SecureRandom to generate a password in code is insecure as it's not a proper way to handle passwords. Also, it's dynamically generated each time and not retrievable.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of generating a password at runtime, use a secure way to handle passwords, such as prompting the user for a password, retrieving it from a secure configuration management system, or using a strong, securely stored passphrase."

        "description": "The code is loading a KeyStore from a URL without any validation of the server's SSL/TLS certificate. This could allow man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate validation by using a TrustManager that checks the server's certificate chain and hostname. This might involve setting up a custom trust store that includes trusted root certificates."

        "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a password, but simply converting the int stream to a string does not guarantee a sufficiently complex or long password.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more reliable password generation strategy that ensures sufficient complexity and length. Consider using a library dedicated to password generation."
