Note: There is an inconsistency in the code snippet provided. The class name `Ed` does not match the instantiated object `new EcbInSymmCryptoBBCase1()`. This appears to be a copy-paste error. If `Ed` was meant to be the correct class, then `new EcbInSymmCryptoBBCase1()` would also be a misuse due to incorrect class instantiation, but this issue is unrelated to crypto API misuses. Also, the IV issue mentioned in the second misuse is a potential vulnerability, but the code does not show how the IV is used or if it's used at all, which would be necessary to confirm this misuse.
