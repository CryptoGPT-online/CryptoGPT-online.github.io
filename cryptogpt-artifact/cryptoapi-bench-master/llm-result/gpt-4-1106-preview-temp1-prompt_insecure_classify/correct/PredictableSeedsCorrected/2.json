  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l);",
  "description": "The use of SecureRandom.setSeed() method with a value generated by calling nextLong() on the same SecureRandom instance can lead to a predictable seed, which makes the random number generator less secure.",
  "recommendation": "Avoid setting the seed of a SecureRandom instance with values generated by itself unless absolutely necessary. If a seed is required, use a more unpredictable source, such as /dev/random, or allow SecureRandom to self-seed."
