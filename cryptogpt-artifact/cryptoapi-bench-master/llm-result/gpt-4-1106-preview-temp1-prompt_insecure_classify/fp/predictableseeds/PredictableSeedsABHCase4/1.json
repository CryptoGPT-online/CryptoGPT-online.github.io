        "description": "The values 300 and 400 are being cast to a byte, which can only hold values up to 127 (0x7F). This leads to integer overflow and results in inadequate values being stored.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that byte values are within the valid range of -128 to 127 to prevent overflow. If higher values are needed, use a larger data type."
