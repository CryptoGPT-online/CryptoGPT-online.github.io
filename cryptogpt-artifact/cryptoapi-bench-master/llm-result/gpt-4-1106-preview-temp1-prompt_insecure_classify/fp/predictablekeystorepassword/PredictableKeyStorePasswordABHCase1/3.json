        "description": "The password for the keystore is being generated using a SecureRandom which is not a hardcoded value. However, the usage of random.ints() without specifying a limit can lead to a non-secure and non-repeatable password that might not meet complexity requirements.",

        "description": "While SecureRandom is used, the way it is being used by calling random.ints() without specifying bounds or length may not generate sufficiently random values, as it may include negative numbers and not provide a sufficiently long or complex password.",

        "recommendation": "Ensure proper certificate validation by using a custom TrustManager that checks the server's certificate chain against trusted CAs. Avoid using the default trust store if it's not guaranteed to be secure."
