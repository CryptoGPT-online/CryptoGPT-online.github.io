        "description": "Even though a `SecureRandom` is used to generate the password, the way it is being converted to a String could result in predictable or non-secure passwords due to insufficient randomness in the conversion process.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure and standard way to generate passwords, such as using `SecureRandom` to generate a byte array and then encoding it with Base64 or a similar mechanism that preserves randomness."

        "description": "The `ints()` method returns an effectively infinite stream of pseudorandom `int` values, and converting this to a String does not provide a proper way to generate a random password. The conversion can result in a non-random appearance in the String representation, leading to insufficient entropy for the password.",
