        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
        "description": "The use of SecureRandom.ints() generates an IntStream, which is not directly usable as a secure password until it is properly collected into a secure random string. By directly converting the IntStream to a string, the code is not using the random values correctly, and the resulting password may not be sufficiently random.",
        "recommendation": "Collect the IntStream into a string of a specified length and character set that is suitable for secure passwords. For example, use SecureRandom to generate a byte array and then convert the byte array to a hexadecimal string or base64 encoded string."

        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
        "description": "While the password is generated at runtime and is not hardcoded in the traditional sense, the method of generation is predictable and repeatable, which could lead to an attacker being able to predict or reproduce the password under certain conditions.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure and unpredictable method of password generation. For example, generate a random byte array and use a secure encoding to turn it into a string."

        "vulnerable_code": "cacerts.openStream()",
        "description": "The code is opening a stream to a URL without any visible certificate validation. If this is an HTTPS connection, there should be proper validation of the server's SSL/TLS certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the SSL/TLS certificate of the server is validated properly, which may include hostname verification and checking the certificate against a list of trusted CAs. This could be done by using a custom SSLSocketFactory or HostnameVerifier with the HttpsURLConnection, or by using a higher-level library that provides proper SSL/TLS validation."
