        "description": "The use of random.ints() without specifying a limit can lead to generating a predictable sequence of values if used repeatedly, which may not provide sufficiently random values as required for cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Use random.nextInt() with a specified range or random.nextBytes() to generate a sufficiently random key."

        "description": "The key material is derived from a potentially insufficiently random source and then truncated or padded to 16 bytes, which could lead to weak encryption if the source does not provide strong randomness or if the key is not of sufficient length.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper key derivation function (KDF) such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt to generate a strong key from a passphrase, or use a secure random number generator to generate a key of appropriate length directly."
