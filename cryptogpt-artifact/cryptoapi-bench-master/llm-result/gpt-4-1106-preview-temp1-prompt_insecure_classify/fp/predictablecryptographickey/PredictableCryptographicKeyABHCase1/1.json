        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
        "description": "The use of SecureRandom.ints() without specifying the size of the integer stream means it will generate a potentially unlimited stream of random integers, which is then converted to a String. This may not provide a sufficiently random value when truncated to fit the key size.",

        "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
        "description": "The key is being reduced or padded to fit exactly 16 bytes (128 bits), which may not be sufficient for high-security applications. AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Using a 128-bit key might be considered weak depending on the context.",
        "recommendation": "Use a key derivation function (KDF) to derive a key of adequate length, and consider using a stronger key size if the context requires it, such as 192 or 256 bits."

        "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
        "description": "While this code generates a key at runtime, if the pattern for generating the key is not complex or random enough, it could effectively become a hardcoded key, especially if the same 'random' key is generated every time due to a flawed random number generation process.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the random number generator is correctly seeded and generates a sufficiently random and unique key each time."
