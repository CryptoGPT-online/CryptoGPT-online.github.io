        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l);",
        "description": "The code is using `SecureRandom.setSeed()` method immediately after generating a random number, which can lead to predictable values because the new seed is derived from the previously generated random number. This reduces the randomness because if the initial state is known or can be guessed, subsequent random numbers can be predicted.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting the seed right after generating a random number unless you have a very specific need for reproducible sequences. Normally, you should let `SecureRandom` manage its own seed and entropy."
