        "description": "Setting the seed of a SecureRandom instance to a value that was just generated by the same instance can lead to predictable values, which reduces randomness and could be used to predict future outputs of the SecureRandom instance.",
        "recommendation": "Do not manually set the seed for SecureRandom with values that could be predictable or controlled by an attacker. Instead, allow SecureRandom to self-seed with entropy from the underlying operating system."
