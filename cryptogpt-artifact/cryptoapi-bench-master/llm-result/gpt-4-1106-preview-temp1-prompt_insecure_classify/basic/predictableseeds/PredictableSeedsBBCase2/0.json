        "description": "The code is initializing a SecureRandom object with a static, single-byte seed. This provides an insufficiently random value as the seed is not complex or unpredictable enough, leading to a predictable sequence of values from the SecureRandom instance.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the static seed and allow SecureRandom to self-seed or use SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to get a strong instance of SecureRandom."
