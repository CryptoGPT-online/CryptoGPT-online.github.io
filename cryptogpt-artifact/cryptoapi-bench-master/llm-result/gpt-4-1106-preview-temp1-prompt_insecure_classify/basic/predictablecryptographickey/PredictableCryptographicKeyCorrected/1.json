        "description": "The use of SecureRandom.ints() without specifying the number of random bytes to generate can lead to using an insufficiently random value for cryptographic operations.",

        "description": "Truncating the key bytes to a length of 16 bytes may not always provide adequate encryption strength, especially if the initial source of key material was not cryptographically strong.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function (KDF) such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt to derive keys from passwords or other non-random input. If a random key is required, ensure it is generated using a cryptographically secure method and is of adequate length."
