            "public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException { }",
            "public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException { }"
        ],
        "description": "The checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are empty, which means they do not perform any validation on the provided certificates. This can allow any certificate, including self-signed or invalid certificates, to be trusted, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic within the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods. This typically involves checking the certificate chain, expiration dates, revocation status, and ensuring the certificates are signed by a trusted Certificate Authority."
