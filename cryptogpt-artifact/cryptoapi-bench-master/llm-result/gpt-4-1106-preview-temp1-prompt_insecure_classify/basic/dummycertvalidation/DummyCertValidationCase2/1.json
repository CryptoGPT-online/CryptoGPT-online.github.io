            "public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException { }",

        ],
        "description": "The methods checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted are empty, meaning they do not perform any validation on the provided certificates. This can lead to trusting any certificate presented during SSL/TLS connections, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic inside checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods. Ensure that the certificate chain is valid, the certificates are not expired, and that they are signed by a trusted CA."
