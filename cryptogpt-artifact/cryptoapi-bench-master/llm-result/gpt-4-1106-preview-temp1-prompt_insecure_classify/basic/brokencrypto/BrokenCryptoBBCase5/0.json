        "description": "The IDEA encryption algorithm is considered to have inadequate encryption strength due to its 64-bit block size, which makes it vulnerable to birthday attacks and other cryptographic weaknesses.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm with a larger block size, such as AES with a 128-bit block size."

        "description": "The code does not specify a secure random number generator or a seed when generating the key, potentially leading to the use of insufficiently random values for cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Use a SecureRandom instance with a seed to generate more secure random values for key generation."
