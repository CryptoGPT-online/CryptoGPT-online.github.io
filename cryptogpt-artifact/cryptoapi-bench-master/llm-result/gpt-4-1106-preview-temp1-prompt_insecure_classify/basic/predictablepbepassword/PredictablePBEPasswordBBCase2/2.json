    "description": "This code snippet indicates the use of PBE (Password-Based Encryption) without specifying the encryption algorithm. The default algorithm could be weak or deprecated, making the encryption less secure.",

    "vulnerable_code": "char [] defaultKey = {'s'};",
    "description": "The password for the PBEKeySpec is hardcoded and very short, which makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Do not hardcode passwords in the source code. Instead, securely manage passwords using a configuration file or environment variables, and ensure the password is of adequate length and complexity."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length specified is 128 bits (16 bytes). While this may be adequate for some use-cases, it may not provide sufficient security for all scenarios, especially when stronger encryption is expected.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a larger key size, such as 256 bits, if the encryption algorithm supports it and the increased security is necessary."
