        "description": "The code uses ECB mode for AES encryption which is not secure because it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality. Identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to identical ciphertext blocks, making it susceptible to various attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM. Remember to handle Initialization Vectors (IV) correctly for these modes."
