Please note that the code snippet provided has a discrepancy, as the `go` method appears to use CBC mode for the Cipher, while the class name 'EcbInSymmCryptoBBCase1' suggests ECB mode. The actual code in the go method does not match the potential insecurity suggested by the class name. It's important to review the rest of the class code to confirm whether ECB mode is indeed used or not. The provided misuse issues are based on the assumption that the class name indicates the use of ECB elsewhere in the code.
