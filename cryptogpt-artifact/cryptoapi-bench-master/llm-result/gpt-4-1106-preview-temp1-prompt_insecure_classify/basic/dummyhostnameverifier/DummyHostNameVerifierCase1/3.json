  "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
  "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n    return true;\n}",
  "description": "The verify method of HostnameVerifier returns true for any host name, which bypasses SSL hostname verification and makes the SSL connection susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by checking that the parameter 's' matches the hostname you expect to connect to, or use the default hostname verifier provided by the SSL library."
