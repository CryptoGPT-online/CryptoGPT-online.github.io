        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) { return true; }",
        "description": "The custom HostnameVerifier implementation always returns true, which means it will accept any certificate presented to it during an SSL/TLS session without any validation, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by checking that the hostname from the server's certificate matches the hostname of the server you are trying to connect to. It's typically best to rely on the default HostnameVerifier provided by the SSL/TLS library if it meets your security requirements."
