        "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n    return true;\n}",
        "description": "The verify method always returns true, which means it will accept any certificate presented during SSL/TLS connections, including invalid or self-signed certificates. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by checking that the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) matches the hostname. Use the default hostname verifier or a custom verifier that properly checks the certificate."
