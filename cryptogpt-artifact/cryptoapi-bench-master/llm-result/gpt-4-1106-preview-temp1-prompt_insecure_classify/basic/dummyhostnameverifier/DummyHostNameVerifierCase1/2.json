        "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n    return true;\n}",
        "description": "The verify method of HostnameVerifier always returns true, which means it does not perform any hostname verification. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks because it accepts any certificate presented by the server, without checking if the hostname in the certificate matches the hostname of the server.",
        "recommendation": "Implement hostname verification logic in the verify method, or use the default hostname verifier provided by the Java runtime, which checks that the hostname matches the hostname in the server's certificate."
