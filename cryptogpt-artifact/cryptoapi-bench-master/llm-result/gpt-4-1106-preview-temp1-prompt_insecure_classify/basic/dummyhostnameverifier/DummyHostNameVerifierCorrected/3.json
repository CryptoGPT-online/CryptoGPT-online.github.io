        "description": "The method verify() always returns true when the hostname is \"192.168.0.10\", bypassing proper certificate validation. This can allow man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker can control the DNS resolution or IP address.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded IP check and ensure the hostname is validated against the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields."
