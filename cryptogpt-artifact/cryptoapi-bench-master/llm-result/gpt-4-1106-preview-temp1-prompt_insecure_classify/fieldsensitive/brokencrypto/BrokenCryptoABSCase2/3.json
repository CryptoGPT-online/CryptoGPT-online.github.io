        "description": "The Blowfish algorithm is considered outdated and potentially insecure for modern applications. It has a block size of 64 bits, which is less than the recommended 128 bits, making it susceptible to birthday attacks and other forms of cryptanalysis.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES with a 128-bit block size."

        "description": "The code does not specify a secure random number generator or a seed for the KeyGenerator, which may result in the generation of keys that are not sufficiently random and are more susceptible to being guessed or determined by an attacker.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that a secure random number generator is used with a proper seed to generate keys. One can use SecureRandom with a seed to initialize the KeyGenerator instance."

        "description": "The code does not specify the key size for the KeyGenerator when using the Blowfish algorithm, which may lead to using a default key size that could be insufficient for strong security. Blowfish keys can range from 32 to 448 bits, and smaller key sizes are less secure.",
        "recommendation": "Specify an appropriate key size when generating keys for encryption to ensure adequate encryption strength. For instance, if continuing with Blowfish, use a key size of 448 bits."
