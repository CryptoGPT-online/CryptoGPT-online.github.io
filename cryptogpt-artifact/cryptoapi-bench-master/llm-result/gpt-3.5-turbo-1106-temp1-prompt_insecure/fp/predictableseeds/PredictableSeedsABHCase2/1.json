[{"misuse": "Insecure use of SecureRandom", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(); sr.setSeed(seed); int v = sr.nextInt();",
  "description": "The code sets the seed of the SecureRandom instance with a fixed value derived from the HashMap, which can lead to predictable output. This undermines the security guarantees provided by SecureRandom.",
  "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom to generate random values directly without specifying a seed, or use a cryptographically secure random number generator such as java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()"}]
