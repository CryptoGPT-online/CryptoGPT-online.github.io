  "description": "Using a low iteration count such as 1020 makes the key-stretching algorithm less effective and more vulnerable to brute force attacks.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count for key-stretching, such as 10000 or more, to improve the strength of the key derivation function."}]
