  "description": "The code is using a randomly generated key and converting it to a string, which is then used as an AES key. This is a form of hardcoded crypto key, as random.ints() is not suitable for generating cryptographic keys.",
  "recommendation": "Generate cryptographic keys using a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom instance with appropriate algorithm (e.g., SHA1PRNG) and key length, and use it directly as the AES key."}]
