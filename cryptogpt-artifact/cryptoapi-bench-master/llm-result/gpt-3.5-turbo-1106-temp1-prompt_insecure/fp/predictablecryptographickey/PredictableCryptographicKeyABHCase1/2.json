[{"misuse": "CWE-332: Insufficient Entropy", 
  "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());", 
  "description": "Using random.ints() to generate a defaultKey does not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic purposes. The random number generated is not cryptographically secure and may be predictable.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator such as SecureRandom to generate the key."}]
