  "description": "The code is using a weak method for key generation by directly converting a string to bytes and padding it to 16 bytes without using a secure key derivation function such as PBKDF2 or using a secure random number generator.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function like PBKDF2 with a random salt to derive a secure AES key. Additionally, use a secure random number generator to generate the salt and avoid using a fixed, hardcoded key."}]
