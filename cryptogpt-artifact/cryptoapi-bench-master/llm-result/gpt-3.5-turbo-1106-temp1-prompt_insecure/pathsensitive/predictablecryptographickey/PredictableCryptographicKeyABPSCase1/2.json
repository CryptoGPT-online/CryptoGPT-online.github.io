[{"misuse": "Insecure Randomness", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); keyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();", 
  "description": "The code is using SecureRandom but directly converting the SecureRandom's generated integers to a string and then to bytes. This may not provide a cryptographically secure random number and could lead to insecure key generation.", 
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a proper method to generate cryptographically secure random numbers, such as SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[]) to generate the keyBytes."}]
