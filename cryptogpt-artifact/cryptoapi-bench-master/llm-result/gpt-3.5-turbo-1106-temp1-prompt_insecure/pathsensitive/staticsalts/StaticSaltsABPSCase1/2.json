  "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a salt value. However, when the choice is greater than 1, it uses a hard-coded value as the salt, which is not sufficiently random.",
  "recommendation": "Ensure that a cryptographically strong random number generator is used to generate the salt for key derivation. Avoid hard-coding or using predictable values for the salt."
