    "description": "The code incorrectly specifies the \"RC2\" algorithm for creating the Cipher instance, but then overrides it with \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" based on the choice value. This can lead to confusion and potential insecure usage of the chosen algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the correct cipher algorithm is chosen based on the provided choice value and remove the initial incorrect specification of the algorithm."
