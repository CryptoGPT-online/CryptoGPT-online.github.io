  "description": "Using the default constructor for SecureRandom may lead to the use of a weak PRNG algorithm, as the default PRNG algorithm is implementation-dependent. Additionally, the code attempts to reseed the SecureRandom instance using the nextBytes method.",

  "description": "The seed provided to initialize the SecureRandom instance is of insufficient length and does not provide enough entropy for secure random number generation.",
  "recommendation": "Use a longer, cryptographically secure random seed to initialize the SecureRandom instance for better randomness and security."},

  "recommendation": "Avoid using fixed seeds for SecureRandom and instead use a truly random and unpredictable seed."}]
