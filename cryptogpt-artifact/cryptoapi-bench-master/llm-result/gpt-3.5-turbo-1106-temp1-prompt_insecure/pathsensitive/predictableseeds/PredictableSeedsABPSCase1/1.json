  "description": "The use of setSeed with a fixed byte sequence or without explicitly calling nextBytes to refresh the seed reduces the entropy of the SecureRandom instance, making it predictable.",
  "recommendation": "Instead of using setSeed, simply rely on the entropy provided by SecureRandom without attempting to set the seed manually. If a custom seed is required, use a truly random and unpredictable value obtained from a secure source."}]
