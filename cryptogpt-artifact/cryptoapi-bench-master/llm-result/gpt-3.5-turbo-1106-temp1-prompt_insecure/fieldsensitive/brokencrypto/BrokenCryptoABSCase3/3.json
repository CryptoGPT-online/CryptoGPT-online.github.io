  "description": "The KeyGenerator is being instantiated with 'defaultAlgo' which is a hard-coded algorithm ('RC4'), and the SecretKey is generated using this KeyGenerator. However, RC4 is considered to be a weak crypto algorithm and should not be used for encryption.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES instead of RC4. Update the 'defaultAlgo' to a more secure algorithm, and ensure that the algorithm can be passed as a parameter to the encrypt method."}]
