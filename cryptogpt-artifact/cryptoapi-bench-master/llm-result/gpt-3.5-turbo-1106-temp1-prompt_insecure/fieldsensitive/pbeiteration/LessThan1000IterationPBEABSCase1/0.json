    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt,passedCount);",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded integer 'passedCount' as the iteration count for the password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm, which can make the encryption vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a sufficiently large and random iteration count, and consider using a dedicated key derivation function like PBKDF2 for more secure key derivation."
