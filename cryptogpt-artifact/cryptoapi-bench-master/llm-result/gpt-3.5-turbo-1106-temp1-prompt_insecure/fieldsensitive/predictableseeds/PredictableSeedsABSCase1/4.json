[{"misuse": "Misuse of SecureRandom", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
  "description": "The code uses SecureRandom.setSeed() to provide seed for the random number generator. This approach is not cryptographically secure as it affects the state of the SecureRandom instance and may lead to predictable output.",
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator like java.security.SecureRandom directly for generating random numbers. Avoid using setSeed() method, instead rely on the built-in seeding mechanism of SecureRandom."}]
