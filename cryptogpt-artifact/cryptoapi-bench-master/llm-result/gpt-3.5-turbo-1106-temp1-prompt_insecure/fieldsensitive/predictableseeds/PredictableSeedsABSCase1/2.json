 "description": "The setSeed method is being used to set the seed for the SecureRandom instance. This approach does not securely initialize the SecureRandom instance and may lead to weak or predictable random values.",
 "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), and avoid calling the setSeed method unless absolutely necessary. Instead, rely on the SecureRandom instance to generate strong random values based on its own entropy source."}]
