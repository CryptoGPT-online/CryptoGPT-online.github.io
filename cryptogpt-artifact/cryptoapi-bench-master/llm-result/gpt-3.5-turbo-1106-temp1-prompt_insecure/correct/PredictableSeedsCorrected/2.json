"description": "Setting the seed of SecureRandom with a single value reduces the entropy and randomness of the generated values. In this case, using a single long value as the seed reduces the strength of the random values generated by the SecureRandom instance.",
"recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without manually setting the seed. In cases where deterministic random values are needed, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) like SecureRandom with a strong seed, such as from SecureRandom.generateSeed."}
