 "description": "Using SecureRandom without specifying a specific cryptographic algorithm may result in insecure random number generation. The default constructor for SecureRandom may not use a strong algorithm or provide sufficient entropy.",

 "description": "The use of Password-Based Encryption (PBE) without carefully chosen parameters can lead to weak key derivation. The strength of the derived key directly depends on the strength of the password and the chosen PBE parameters.",
 "recommendation": "Ensure that strong and appropriate PBE parameters are chosen, such as a high iteration count and a secure hash function like SHA-256 for key derivation."}]
