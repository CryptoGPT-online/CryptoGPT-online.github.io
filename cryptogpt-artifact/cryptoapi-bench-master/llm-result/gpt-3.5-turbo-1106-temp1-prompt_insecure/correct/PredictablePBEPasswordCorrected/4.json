  "description": "The usage of a weak key derivation function such as PBEKeySpec with low iteration count and small key length could lead to weak key generation, making the encryption vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Use a strong key derivation function with a higher iteration count and a longer key length, like PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256."}]
