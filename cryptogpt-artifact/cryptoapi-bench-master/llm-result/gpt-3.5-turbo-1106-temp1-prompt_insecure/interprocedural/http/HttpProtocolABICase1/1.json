[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(url));",
  "description": "The code does not perform any validation of SSL/TLS certificates when connecting to the specified URL. This can result in insecure connections and potentially allow for man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "recommendation": "It is important to perform proper certificate validation when making SSL/TLS connections. This can be achieved by using the HttpsURLConnection class and configuring it to validate the server's certificate. Additionally, implementing hostname verification can further enhance the security of the connection."}]
