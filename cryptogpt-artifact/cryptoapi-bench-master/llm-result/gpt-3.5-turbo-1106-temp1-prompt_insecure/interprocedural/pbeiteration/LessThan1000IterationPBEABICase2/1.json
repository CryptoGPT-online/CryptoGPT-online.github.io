  "description": "The SecureRandom instance is being used to generate salt for password-based encryption (PBE), but it's not clear whether this salt is being used securely for PBE. Also, the size of the salt (32 bytes) might be too small for some PBE algorithms.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure and well-established algorithm for password-based encryption (PBE), and ensure that the salt size is appropriate for the chosen algorithm. Consider using a well-established library for PBE operations, such as the ones provided by Bouncy Castle."}]
