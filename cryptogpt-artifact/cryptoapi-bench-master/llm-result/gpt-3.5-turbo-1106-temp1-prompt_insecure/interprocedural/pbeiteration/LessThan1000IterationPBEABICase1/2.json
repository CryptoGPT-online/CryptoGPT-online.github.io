  "description": "The SecureRandom instance 'random' is not seeded with a specific seed, which may lead to weak or predictable random values. Using weak or predictable randomness can lead to cryptographic key compromise and other security vulnerabilities.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographic strength random number generator (RNG) such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to ensure secure, unpredictable random values. Additionally, consider using a well-established cryptographic library, such as Apache Commons Crypto, for generating salts and other cryptographic primitives."}]
