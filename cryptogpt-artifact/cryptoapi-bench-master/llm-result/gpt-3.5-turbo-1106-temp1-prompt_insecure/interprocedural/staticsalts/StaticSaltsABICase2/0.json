  "description": "The code is attempting to parse the 'salt' character array to a byte array and use it as the salt for the Password-Based Encryption (PBE) algorithm. This is insecure because the salt should be unpredictable and randomly generated, whereas '12345' which is assigned to SALT is a hard-coded default value.",
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a strong salt for the PBE algorithm, and ensure that each salt value is unique."}]
