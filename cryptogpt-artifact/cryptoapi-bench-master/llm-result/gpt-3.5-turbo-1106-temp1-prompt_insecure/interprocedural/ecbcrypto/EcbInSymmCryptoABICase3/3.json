{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", 
 "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
 "description": "The code uses the electronic codebook (ECB) mode for AES encryption, which is insecure as it does not hide patterns in the plaintext and can lead to leakage of sensitive information.",
 "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)."}
