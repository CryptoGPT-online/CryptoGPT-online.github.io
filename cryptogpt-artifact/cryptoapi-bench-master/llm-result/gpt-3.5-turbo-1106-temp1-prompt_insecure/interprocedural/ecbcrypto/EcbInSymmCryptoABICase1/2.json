  "misuse": "Insecure Initialization Vector",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
  "description": "The code is using AES algorithm in ECB mode which does not use an initialization vector (IV). This can lead to security vulnerabilities by exposing patterns in the data.",
  "recommendation": "Use AES algorithm in a secure mode such as CBC or GCM which requires an IV."
