  "description": "The use of ECB mode for AES is insecure and can lead to vulnerabilities. Additionally, relying on a specified char array for the cryptographic algorithm can lead to potential insecure algorithm usage.",
  "recommendation": "Avoid using ECB mode for AES. Instead, use secure modes such as GCM or CBC. Use the actual crypto algorithm string directly (e.g., \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\") rather than relying on a char array."
