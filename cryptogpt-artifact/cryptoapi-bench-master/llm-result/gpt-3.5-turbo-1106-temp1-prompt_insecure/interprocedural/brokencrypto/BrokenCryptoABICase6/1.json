  "description": "The KeyGenerator is initialized with the value of a char array which contains the name of the cryptographic algorithm. However, the char array 'crypto' is not properly initialized with secure random values, which might lead to predictable keys being generated.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure random source such as SecureRandom to properly initialize the key material."
