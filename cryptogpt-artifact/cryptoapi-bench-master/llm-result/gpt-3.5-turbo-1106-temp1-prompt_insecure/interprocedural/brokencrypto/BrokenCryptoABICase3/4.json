  "description": "Using RC4 as the cryptographic algorithm is not recommended due to its vulnerabilities. Additionally, using the same algorithm for both key generation and encryption can lead to weak security.",
  "recommendation": "Switch to a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES, and use different algorithms for key generation and encryption. For example, use KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\") for key generation and Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\") for encryption."
