"description": "The code is using hardcoded cryptographic algorithm and mode (DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding) which is considered weak and should not be used in secure systems. In addition, the use of char array to store the cryptographic algorithm and mode is unnecessary and makes the code more error-prone.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm (e.g., AES) with secure mode of operation (e.g., GCM) and padding (e.g., PKCS7Padding). Avoid storing cryptographic algorithm and mode in char array and consider using a secure Key Management System to generate and store cryptographic keys."}
