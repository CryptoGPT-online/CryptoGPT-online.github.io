 "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
 "description": "The KeyGenerator is being initialized with a custom string representation of the cryptographic algorithm, which can lead to weak encryption. It's unclear what algorithm is actually being used.",
 "recommendation": "Use a well-established cryptographic algorithm like AES with a proper mode and padding scheme."}
