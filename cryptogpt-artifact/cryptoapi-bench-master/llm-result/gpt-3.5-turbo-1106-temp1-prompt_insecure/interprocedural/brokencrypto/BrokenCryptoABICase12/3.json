  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);",
  "description": "The KeyGenerator.getInstance method is being used with a variable 'crypto' that may contain user-input data. This can lead to insecure crypto algorithm being used if not properly validated.",
  "recommendation": "Ensure that the 'crypto' variable only contains secure and approved cryptographic algorithm names."
