{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", 
 "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
 "description": "The algorithm specified in the getInstance method should not be obtained from a variable as it can be easily tampered with. In this case, the crypto variable is not initialized and its value can be easily manipulated by an attacker.",
 "recommendation": "Hardcode the cryptographic algorithm and avoid obtaining it from a variable. Use a well-known and secure algorithm like AES instead of RC2."}
