  "description": "Using a low iteration count can weaken the derived key, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks. An iteration count of 11010 is relatively low and should be increased for stronger key derivation.",
  "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value that provides an appropriate level of security based on current best practices, such as 100,000 or higher."}]
