[{"misuse": "Weak Key Generation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);", 
  "description": "The key is generated using a simple string.getBytes() method, which may not provide enough entropy for strong cryptographic keys. The key is also not hashed or salted, potentially weakening its security.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a secure method for key generation, such as a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) or a key derivation function (KDF). Ensure that the key has sufficient entropy and is properly managed, possibly using a key management system."}]
