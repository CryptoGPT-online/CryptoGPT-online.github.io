[{"misuse": "Weak Key Generation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
  "description": "The code generates the AES key by using a string directly converted to bytes, and then truncates the byte array to 16 bytes, which may weaken the key strength.",
  "recommendation": "Use a proper key generation algorithm such as SecureRandom to generate secure AES keys, also consider using a key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2 for deriving a key from a password."}]
