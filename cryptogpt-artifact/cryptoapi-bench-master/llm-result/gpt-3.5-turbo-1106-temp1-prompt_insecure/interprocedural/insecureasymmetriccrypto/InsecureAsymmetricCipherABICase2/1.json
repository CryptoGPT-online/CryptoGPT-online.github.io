  "description": "The KeyPairGenerator is initialized with a fixed key size of 1024 bits, which may be insecure for some cryptographic operations as it does not provide adequate security strength.",
  "recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 2048 bits for RSA encryption to ensure sufficient security strength."
