  "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(\"my.host.name\", 443);", 
  "description": "The code does not perform any certificate validation when creating the SSL socket, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.", 
  "recommendation": "Always perform proper certificate validation by implementing a custom TrustManager that verifies the server's certificate or hostname. This can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks."}]
