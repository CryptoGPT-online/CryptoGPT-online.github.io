  "description": "The code uses MessageDigest.getInstance to obtain a SHA-256 MessageDigest object, but it does not specify a cryptographic provider. This means the default JRE provider will be used, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations, leading to insecure randomness.",
  "recommendation": "Specify a cryptographic provider when obtaining the MessageDigest instance, such as MES.getMessageDigest(\"SHA-256\", \"BC\") where \"BC\" is the Bouncy Castle provider."}]
