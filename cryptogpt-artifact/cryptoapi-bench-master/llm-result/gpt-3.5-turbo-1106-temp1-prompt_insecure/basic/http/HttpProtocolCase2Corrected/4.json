  "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(url))",
  "description": "The code does not perform any certificate validation when creating a new URL object from the input URL. This can make the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where an attacker could present a fake SSL certificate and the application would trust it.",
  "recommendation": "Always perform proper certificate validation when working with SSL/TLS connections. Use HttpsURLConnection for more fine-grained control over SSL/TLS configuration."}]
