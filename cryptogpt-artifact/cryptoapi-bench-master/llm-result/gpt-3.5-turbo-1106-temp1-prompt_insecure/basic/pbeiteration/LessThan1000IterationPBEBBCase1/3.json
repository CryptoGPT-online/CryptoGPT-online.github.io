"description": "The SecureRandom instance is not explicitly seeded with a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG), and it is used to generate a salt value for password-based encryption. As a result, the generated salt may not be of high quality, leading to weakened security.", 
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong RNG such as java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to generate the salt value for password-based encryption."}]
