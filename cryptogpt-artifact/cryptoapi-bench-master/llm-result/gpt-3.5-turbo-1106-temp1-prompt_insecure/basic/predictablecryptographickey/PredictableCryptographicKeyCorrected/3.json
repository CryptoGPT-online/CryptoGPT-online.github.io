  "description": "Using the weak PKCS5 padding scheme for AES encryption is not recommended as it may lead to padding oracle attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure padding scheme such as PKCS7Padding or use a modern mode like GCM or CCM, which not only provides encryption but also integrity and authenticity of the message."}]
