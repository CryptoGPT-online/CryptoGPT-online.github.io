  "description": "The code uses a hardcoded key which is considered insecure because hardcoded keys can be easily extracted from the source code.",
  "recommendation": "Generate a random and sufficiently long key, and securely store the key outside of the source code, such as in a key store or using environment variables."

  "description": "The SecureRandom class is being used but it is being initialized without explicitly specifying the algorithm and provider, which may lead to unpredictable or weak randomness. This can weaken the security of the cryptographic operations.",
  "recommendation": "Explicitly specify the SecureRandom algorithm and provider, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), to ensure secure random number generation."
