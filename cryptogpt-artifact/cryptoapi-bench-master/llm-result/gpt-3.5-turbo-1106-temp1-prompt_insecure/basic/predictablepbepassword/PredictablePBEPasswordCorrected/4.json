    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not being properly seeded with entropy, and the use of random.ints() to generate a password could lead to a weak and predictable password. Additionally, the byte array 'salt' is being generated using random.nextBytes() which can weaken cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to generate a random password and salt, such as using SecureRandom's nextBytes() to generate password and salt or using a strong password hashing function like PBKDF2 to generate the password."
