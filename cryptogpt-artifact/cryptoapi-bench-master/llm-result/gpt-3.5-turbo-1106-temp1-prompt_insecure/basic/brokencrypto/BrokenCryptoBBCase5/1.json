  "description": "The code uses the IDEA encryption algorithm which is known to be weak and also considered as broken due to its short key length.", 
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to use strong and widely accepted cryptographic algorithms such as AES, and to use a minimum key size of 128 bits."}]
