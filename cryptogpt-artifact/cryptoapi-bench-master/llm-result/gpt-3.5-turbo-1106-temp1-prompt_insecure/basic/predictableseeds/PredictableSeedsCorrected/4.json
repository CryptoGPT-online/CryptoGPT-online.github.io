  "description": "Setting the seed of a SecureRandom instance with a single long value may weaken the cryptographic strength of the random values generated. Additionally, using a single long value as the seed may make the random values predictable.",
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator without explicitly setting the seed for generating random values. If seeding is necessary, use a strong and unpredictable source of entropy to initialize the SecureRandom instance."}]
