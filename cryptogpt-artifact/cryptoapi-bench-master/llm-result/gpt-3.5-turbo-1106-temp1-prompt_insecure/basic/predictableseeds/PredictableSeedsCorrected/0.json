  "description": "Setting the seed of SecureRandom with a non-random value (in this case, the result of sr.nextLong()) undermines the security provided by SecureRandom, as it can introduce predictability in the generated random values.", 
  "recommendation": "Avoid setting the seed of SecureRandom with deterministic or non-random values. Instead, allow SecureRandom to generate its own secure random seed. If a specific seed is required, use a cryptographically secure random source to generate it."}]
