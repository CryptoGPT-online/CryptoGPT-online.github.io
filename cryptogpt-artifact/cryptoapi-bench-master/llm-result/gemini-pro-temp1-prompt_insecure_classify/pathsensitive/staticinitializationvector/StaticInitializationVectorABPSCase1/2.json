    "description": "The SecureRandom instance `sr` is not properly seeded, which may result in predictable values being generated. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as weak encryption or key generation.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and properly seeding it with a cryptographically secure seed."
