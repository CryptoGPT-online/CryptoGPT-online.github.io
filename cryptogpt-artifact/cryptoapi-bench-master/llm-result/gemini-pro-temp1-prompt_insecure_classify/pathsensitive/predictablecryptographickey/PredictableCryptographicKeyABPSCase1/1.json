    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();",
    "description": "The code uses `random.ints()` to generate a random key. However, `random.ints()` is not suitable for generating cryptographically secure keys. It generates pseudorandom numbers, which are not as unpredictable as truly random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.generateSeed()`, to generate the key."
