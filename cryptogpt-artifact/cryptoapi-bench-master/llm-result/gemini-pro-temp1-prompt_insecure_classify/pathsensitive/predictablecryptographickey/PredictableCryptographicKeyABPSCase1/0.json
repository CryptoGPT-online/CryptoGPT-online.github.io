    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nkeyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();",
    "description": "The code is using `SecureRandom.ints()` to generate the key bytes, which is not cryptographically secure. `SecureRandom.ints()` is meant for non-security-sensitive applications and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the key bytes. For Java, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which is a CSPRNG suitable for cryptographic applications."
