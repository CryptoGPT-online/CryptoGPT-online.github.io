Sure, here is the JSON format report of the crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr2 = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "The code uses a statically initialized SecureRandom object and a hardcoded salt value, which makes the generated keys predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and generate a random salt for each encryption operation."
  }
]
```

This misuse falls under CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values. The code uses a hardcoded salt value and a statically initialized SecureRandom object. This makes the generated keys predictable and insecure.

The corrected code should be:
```java
public class S1 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        S1 cs = new S1();
        int choice=2;
        cs.key2(choice);
    }

    public void key2(int choice){
        PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        SecureRandom sr2 = new SecureRandom(); // Use a CSPRNG instead
        byte[] salt = new byte[32]; // Generate a random salt
        sr2.nextBytes(salt);
        int count = 1020;
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
    }
}
```

This change ensures that a secure random salt is generated for each encryption operation, making the generated keys more secure.
