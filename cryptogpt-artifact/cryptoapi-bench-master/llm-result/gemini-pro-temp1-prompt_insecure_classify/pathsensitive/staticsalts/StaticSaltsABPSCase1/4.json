    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "The code uses a static byte array for the salt value. This makes the salt predictable and easy to brute force.",

    "description": "The code uses a low iteration count for the key derivation function. This makes the encryption weaker and easier to crack.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 100,000 or more."
