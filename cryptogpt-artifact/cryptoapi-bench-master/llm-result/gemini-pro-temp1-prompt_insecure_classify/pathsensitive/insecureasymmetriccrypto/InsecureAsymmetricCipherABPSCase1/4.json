    "vulnerable_code": "int keysize;\nif (choice>1)\n    keysize = 2048;\nelse\n    keysize = 1024;",
    "description": "The key size of RSA is set to 1024 bits if the 'choice' is not greater than 1, which is considered insufficient for modern security standards. 1024-bit RSA keys are no longer considered secure and can be broken using readily available computing resources.",
    "recommendation": "Always use a key size of at least 2048 bits for RSA to ensure adequate encryption strength. Consider using even larger key sizes (e.g., 4096 bits) for highly sensitive data or applications."
