    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random numbers. However, the `setSeed` method is used to set the seed value for the random number generator. This means that the random numbers generated will be predictable, which can be a security risk.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using `setSeed`, use `SecureRandom` without specifying a seed value. This will ensure that the random numbers generated are truly random."
