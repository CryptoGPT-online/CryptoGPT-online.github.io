    "description": "The `SecureRandom` instance is seeded with a user-provided byte array `bytes`, which may not be sufficiently random. This can lead to predictable or guessable random values generated by the `SecureRandom` instance.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the seed for the `SecureRandom` instance. This can be done using `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, avoid using small or predictable values as seeds."
