    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not properly seeded, which can lead to predictable or weak random values. This can compromise the security of the generated salt and make it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable source of randomness to seed the `SecureRandom` instance. This can be achieved by using `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."
