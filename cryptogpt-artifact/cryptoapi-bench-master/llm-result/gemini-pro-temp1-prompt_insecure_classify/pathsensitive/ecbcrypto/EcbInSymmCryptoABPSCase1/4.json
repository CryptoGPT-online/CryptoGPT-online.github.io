    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses ECB mode for encryption, which is not secure and can be easily broken. ECB mode does not provide any confidentiality or integrity protection, and it is vulnerable to various attacks, such as the birthday attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure block cipher mode such as CBC or CTR instead of ECB."

    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses AES without specifying the key length. By default, AES is initialized with a 128-bit key, which is considered insecure. This is because 128-bit keys can be broken with a brute-force attack in a reasonable amount of time.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a secure key length for AES, such as 256 bits."
