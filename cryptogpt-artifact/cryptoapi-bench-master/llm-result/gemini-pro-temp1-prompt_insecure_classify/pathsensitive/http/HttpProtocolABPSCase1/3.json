After reviewing the provided code, I did not identify any crypto API misuses or insecure use of crypto APIs. Therefore, the JSON response is empty.

```json

However, it's worth noting that the code does not perform any cryptographic operations or handle any sensitive data. If you were to add cryptographic operations or handle sensitive data in the future, it would be crucial to review the code for potential crypto API misuses or insecure practices.
