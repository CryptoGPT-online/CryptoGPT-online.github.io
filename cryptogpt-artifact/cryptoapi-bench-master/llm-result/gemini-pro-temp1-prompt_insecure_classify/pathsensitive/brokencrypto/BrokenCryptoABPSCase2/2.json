    "vulnerable_code": "if (choice > 1)\n            cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses a conditional statement to select between two different cipher algorithms, Blowfish and AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding. This allows an attacker to manipulate the choice variable to force the use of the less-secure Blowfish algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the conditional statement and always use the more secure AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm."
