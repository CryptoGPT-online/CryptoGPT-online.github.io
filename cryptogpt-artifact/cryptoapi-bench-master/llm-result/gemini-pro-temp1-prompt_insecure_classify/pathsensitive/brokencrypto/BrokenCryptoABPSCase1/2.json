    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "DES is a legacy encryption algorithm that is considered insecure due to its short key length (56 bits) and susceptibility to brute-force attacks. ECB mode is also insecure as it does not provide any confidentiality protection.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a key length of at least 128 bits and a strong block cipher mode such as CBC or GCM."
