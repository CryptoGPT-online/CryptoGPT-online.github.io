    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that has been found to be vulnerable to collision attacks. This means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be used to create digital signatures that are difficult to verify, or to create malicious software that can bypass security checks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
