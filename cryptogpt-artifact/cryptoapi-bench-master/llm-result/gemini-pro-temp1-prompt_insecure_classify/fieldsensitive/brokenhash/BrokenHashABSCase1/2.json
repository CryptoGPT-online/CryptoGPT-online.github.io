    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "SHA1 is a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for new applications. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be used to create fraudulent certificates, digital signatures, and other attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace SHA1 with a more secure algorithm, such as SHA256 or SHA512."
