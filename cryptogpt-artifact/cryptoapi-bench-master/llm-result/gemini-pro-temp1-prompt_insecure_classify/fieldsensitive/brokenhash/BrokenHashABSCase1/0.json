    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "SHA1 is a broken cryptographic hash function that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be used to create fraudulent digital signatures and other attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace SHA1 with a more secure hash function, such as SHA256 or SHA512."
