    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "`SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});`",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with a fixed seed (`byte[] {passedSeed}`), which makes the generated random values predictable. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, as an attacker could potentially guess the generated values.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong`, which uses a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). This can be done by replacing the line `SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});` with `SecureRandom sr = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong();`."
