    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is initialized with a seed that is derived from a single byte, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. An attacker could potentially guess the seed and predict the sequence of random numbers generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate random numbers."
