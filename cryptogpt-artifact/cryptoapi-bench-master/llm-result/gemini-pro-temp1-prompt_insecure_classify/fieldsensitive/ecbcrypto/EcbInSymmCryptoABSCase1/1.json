    "description": "The provided code uses KeyGenerator to generate an AES key without specifying the key length. By default, AES keys are generated with a length of 128 bits, which is considered to be inadequate for modern cryptographic applications. It is recommended to explicitly specify a stronger key length, such as 256 bits, to ensure adequate encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a stronger key length when generating the AES key, such as 256 bits, to ensure adequate encryption strength. For example:\n\n`KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nkeyGen.init(256); // Specify a key length of 256 bits\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();`"
