    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not properly seeded, which may result in predictable or weak random values. In this case, the random number generator is initialized without any seed, making it susceptible to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and properly seed it with a strong seed, such as from `SecureRandom.getSeed(int numBytes)`. This will ensure that the generated random values are unpredictable and less susceptible to attacks."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The iteration count (`count`) for the PBKDF2 algorithm is set to a low value (20), which may result in weak encryption. A higher iteration count is recommended to increase the strength of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, use a higher value for the iteration count, such as 10000 or more. This will make the encryption process slower, but it will also make it more resistant to brute-force attacks."
