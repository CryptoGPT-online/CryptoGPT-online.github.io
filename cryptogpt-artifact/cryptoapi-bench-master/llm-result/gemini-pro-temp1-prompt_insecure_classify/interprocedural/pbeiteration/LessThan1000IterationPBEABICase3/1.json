    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Weak Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code generates a 32-byte salt using `SecureRandom` for use with a Password-Based Encryption (PBE) scheme. However, the `SecureRandom` instance is not properly seeded, potentially leading to weak and predictable random values.",
    "fix": "To fix this issue, ensure that the `SecureRandom` instance is properly seeded with a strong source of randomness before generating the salt. This can be achieved by using `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` or by providing a seed to the constructor."
