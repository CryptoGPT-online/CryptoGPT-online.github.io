Sure, here is the JSON report of crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"IDEA\"",
    "description": "The IDEA algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the use of IDEA with a more secure algorithm, such as AES."
  }
]
```

In this case, the misuse is classified as CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, because the provided code uses the IDEA algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purposes.

To fix this issue, you should replace the use of IDEA with a more secure algorithm, such as AES. Here is the fixed code:

```java
public class B9Fixed {
    public void go(String crypto) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        B9Fixed bc = new B9Fixed();
        String crypto = "AES";
        bc.go(crypto);
    }
}
```

This code uses the AES algorithm, which is a more secure choice for cryptographic purposes.
