    "description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered weak and insecure by today's standards. DES has a small key size of 56 bits, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES-256."

    "description": "The code generates a single key and uses it for multiple encryptions. This is insecure because an attacker could potentially obtain the key and decrypt all of the encrypted messages.",
