    "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric block cipher that was widely used in the past. However, it is now considered insecure due to its short key length (56 bits) and susceptibility to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace DES with a more secure algorithm, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or 3DES (Triple DES)."
