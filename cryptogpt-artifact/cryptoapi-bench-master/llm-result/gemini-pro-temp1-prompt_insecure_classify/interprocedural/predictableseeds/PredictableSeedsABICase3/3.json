Sure, here is the JSON report for the Java code you provided:

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` instance is seeded with a fixed value (`seed`), which may not be sufficiently random. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the values generated by the `SecureRandom` instance.",

**CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**

* **Description:** The `SecureRandom` instance is seeded with a fixed value (`seed`), which may not be sufficiently random. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the values generated by the `SecureRandom` instance.
* **Recommendation:** Use a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`, and seed it with a truly random value.
