    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class relies on a seed value to generate random numbers. Setting the seed with a constant value (`seed`) makes the generated random numbers predictable, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a constant value as the seed, generate a truly random seed using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). This can be done using the `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` method."
