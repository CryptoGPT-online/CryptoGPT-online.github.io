    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a byte array containing the same seed value. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and not cryptographically secure.",
    "recommendation": "To generate cryptographically secure random numbers, use a more secure source of randomness, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. You can also use a `SecureRandom` instance that is seeded with a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) like this: `SecureRandom sr = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG");`"
