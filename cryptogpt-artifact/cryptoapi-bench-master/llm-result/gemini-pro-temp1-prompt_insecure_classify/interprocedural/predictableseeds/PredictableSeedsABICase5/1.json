    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
    "description": "The seed used for `SecureRandom` is not sufficiently random. It is generated using a fixed sequence of bytes, which can be easily predicted by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to generate the seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. This method generates a seed that is cryptographically secure."
