    "description": "The seed value for `SecureRandom` is not sufficiently random. Using a constant seed value makes it easier for an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom` with a strong seed value obtained from a secure random number generator, to generate the seed."
