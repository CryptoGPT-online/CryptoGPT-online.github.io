    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `seed` used to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance is not sufficiently random. This makes it easier for an attacker to predict the values generated by the `SecureRandom` instance.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to generate the seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Alternatively, if you need to use a fixed seed, make sure that the seed is of sufficient length and complexity to resist brute-force attacks."
