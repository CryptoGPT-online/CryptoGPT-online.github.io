    "description": "Using a fixed seed for `SecureRandom` will result in a predictable sequence of random numbers, which can be exploited in cryptographic attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and provide it with a sufficient amount of entropy (e.g., from a hardware random number generator or a combination of multiple sources of randomness)."
