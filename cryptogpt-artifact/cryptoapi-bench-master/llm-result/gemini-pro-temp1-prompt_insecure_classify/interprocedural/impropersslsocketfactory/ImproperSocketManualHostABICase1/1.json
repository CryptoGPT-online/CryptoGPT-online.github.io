    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
    "description": "This code uses the default SSLSocketFactory, which does not perform any certificate validation. This means that a man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept the connection and impersonate the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a SSLSocketFactory that performs certificate validation, such as the one provided by the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE). For example, you can use the following code:\n```\nSSLSocketFactory ssf = SSLSocketFactory.getInstance(\"TLS\");\n```"
