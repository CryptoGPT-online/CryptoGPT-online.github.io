    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
    "description": "The code is using ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which is a basic and insecure block cipher mode of operation. ECB mode does not provide any confidentiality or integrity protection, and it is susceptible to a variety of attacks, such as the padding oracle attack.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of ECB mode, use a more secure block cipher mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter) mode."
