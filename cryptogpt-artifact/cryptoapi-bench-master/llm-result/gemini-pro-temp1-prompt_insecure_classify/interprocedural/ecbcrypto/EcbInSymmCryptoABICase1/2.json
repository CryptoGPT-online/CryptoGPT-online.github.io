    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code is using ECB mode, which is a vulnerable block cipher mode of operation. ECB mode is not secure because it does not provide any confidentiality or integrity protection. Attackers can easily break ECB mode by using a chosen-plaintext attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM."
