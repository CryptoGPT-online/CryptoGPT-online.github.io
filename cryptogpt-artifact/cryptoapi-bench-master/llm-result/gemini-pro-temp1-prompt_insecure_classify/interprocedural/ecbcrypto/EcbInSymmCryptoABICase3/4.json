    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which is a block cipher mode that encrypts each block of plaintext independently. ECB mode is not secure because it does not provide any confidentiality or integrity protection. An attacker can easily identify and modify individual blocks of ciphertext, which can lead to a successful attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). These modes provide confidentiality and integrity protection by encrypting each block of plaintext using a key derived from the previous block of ciphertext."
