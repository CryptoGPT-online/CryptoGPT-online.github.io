  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses ECB mode with PKCS5 padding, which is not considered secure for most applications. ECB mode is deterministic, meaning that identical plaintext blocks will always produce identical ciphertext blocks. This can make it easier for an attacker to identify patterns in the data and potentially recover the plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC, CFB, or OFB, along with a strong initialization vector (IV)."
