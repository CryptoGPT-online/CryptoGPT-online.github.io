    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code dynamically constructs a cipher instance using the `crypto` variable, which is derived from the DEFAULT_CRYPTO constant. This allows an attacker to specify a weak or insecure cipher algorithm by modifying the value of the `crypto` variable. For example, an attacker could change the algorithm to `AES/ECB/NoPadding`, which is known to be insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and secure cipher algorithm, such as `AES/GCM/NoPadding`, and avoid allowing user input to influence the choice of cipher algorithm."
