    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The code uses a low iteration count for the key derivation function, which makes the encryption weak and susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value that is considered secure, typically at least 100,000."
