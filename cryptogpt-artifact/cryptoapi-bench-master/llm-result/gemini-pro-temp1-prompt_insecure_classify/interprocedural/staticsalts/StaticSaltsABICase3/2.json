    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "int count2 = c;\nmethod2(s,count2);",
    "description": "The variable `count2` is initialized with the value of `count`, which is 1020. This value is too low for the number of iterations in the PBKDF2 algorithm. A low iteration count makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the value of `count` to a more secure value, such as at least 100,000."
