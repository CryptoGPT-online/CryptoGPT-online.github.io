Sure, here are the crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static String KEY = \"sagar\";",
    "description": "The encryption key \"sagar\" is a weak password and provides insufficient security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong, unique password or key with sufficient length and complexity."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static char [] DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = KEY.toCharArray();",
    "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded in the source code, which makes it vulnerable to compromise.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding encryption keys in the source code. Instead, use a secure key management system or environment variables to store and manage encryption keys."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nbyte [] salt = new byte[16];\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not properly seeded, which may result in insufficient randomness in the generated salt.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the SecureRandom instance is properly seeded with a strong source of entropy, such as `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."
  }
]
```

I recommend addressing these misuses to improve the security of your code.
