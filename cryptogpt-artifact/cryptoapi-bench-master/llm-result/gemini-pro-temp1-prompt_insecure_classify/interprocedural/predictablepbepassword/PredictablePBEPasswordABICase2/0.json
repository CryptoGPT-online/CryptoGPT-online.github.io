Sure, here are the crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static String KEY = \"sagar\";\npublic static char [] DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = KEY.toCharArray();",
    "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded as a string and character array, which makes it vulnerable to compromise.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating and storing the encryption key, such as a key management system or a secure random number generator."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey,salt,10000,16);",
    "description": "The encryption algorithm and parameters used (PBEKeySpec with 10000 iterations and a 16-byte key) are considered weak and may not provide sufficient security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm and parameters, such as AES-256 with a longer key and more iterations."
  }
]
```

There are two misuses identified:

1. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials**
   - The encryption key is hardcoded as a string and character array, which makes it vulnerable to compromise. An attacker could easily obtain the key by decompiling the code or using other techniques.

2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - The encryption algorithm and parameters used (PBEKeySpec with 10000 iterations and a 16-byte key) are considered weak and may not provide sufficient security. An attacker could potentially break the encryption with a brute-force attack.

**Recommendations:**

- To fix the CWE-798 misuse, use a more secure method for generating and storing the encryption key, such as a key management system or a secure random number generator.
- To fix the CWE-326 misuse, use a stronger encryption algorithm and parameters, such as AES-256 with a longer key and more iterations.
