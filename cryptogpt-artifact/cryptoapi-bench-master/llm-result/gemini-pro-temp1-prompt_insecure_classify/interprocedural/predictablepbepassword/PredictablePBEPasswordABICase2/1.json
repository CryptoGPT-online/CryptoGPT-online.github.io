Sure, here are the potential crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static String KEY = \"sagar\";",
    "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded as a static string, which is insecure as it can be easily discovered by attackers.",
    "recommendation": "Generate encryption keys randomly and securely, and store them in a secure location."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey,salt,10000,16);",
    "description": "The number of iterations for the password-based encryption (PBE) is set to 10000, which is considered to be low and may not provide sufficient security against brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to a higher value (e.g., 65536 or more) to improve the security of the encryption."
  }
]
```

To fix these misuses, you can follow these recommendations:

* **Use secure and randomly generated keys.** Instead of hardcoding the encryption key, you should generate it randomly and securely using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). You can use `SecureRandom` class in Java for this purpose.
* **Increase the number of iterations for PBE.** By increasing the number of iterations, you make it more difficult for attackers to brute-force the password. The exact number of iterations depends on the specific algorithm and security requirements, but it is generally recommended to use at least 100,000 iterations.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
