    "description": "The key length of 16 bytes (128 bits) is considered weak for modern cryptographic algorithms. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits for symmetric algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 256 bits or use a stronger encryption algorithm that supports longer key lengths."

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not properly seeded, which may result in insufficient randomness in the generated salt. This can weaken the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate the salt. Additionally, consider using a larger salt size (e.g., 32 bytes) to further enhance the security."
