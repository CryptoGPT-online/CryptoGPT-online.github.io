    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "Using the default constructor to instantiate `SecureRandom` is not secure, as it uses a weak seed. Instead, it should be instantiated with a cryptographically secure seed, such as one generated from `getSeed(int numBytes)`. Additionally, the `SecureRandom` instance should be properly seeded before use to ensure that it produces cryptographically secure random values.",
    "recommendation": "Use `SecureRandom` with a strong seed source, such as `NativePRNG` or `SHA1PRNG`, or use a more modern API like `java.security.KeyGenerator`."
