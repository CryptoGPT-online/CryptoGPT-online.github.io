    "description": "The key length used for encryption (16 bytes) is considered too short and provides insufficient security. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits (32 bytes).",

    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` without specifying a source of randomness, which may result in predictable or non-random values for the salt. This can weaken the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is properly seeded to generate the salt. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."
