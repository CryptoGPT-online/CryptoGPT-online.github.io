    "description": "The code contains a hardcoded URL, which is a security risk. Hardcoded credentials can be easily compromised by attackers, leading to unauthorized access or other security breaches.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding the URL, it should be read from a secure configuration file or environment variable. This will make it more difficult for attackers to compromise the credentials."
