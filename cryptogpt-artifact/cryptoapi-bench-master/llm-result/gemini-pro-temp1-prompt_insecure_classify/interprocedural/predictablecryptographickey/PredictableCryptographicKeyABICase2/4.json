**CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials**

The encryption key is hardcoded as a string literal (`"defaultkey"`) in the code. This makes it easy for an attacker to discover and use to decrypt sensitive data.

**CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**

The encryption key is derived from a string (`encryptKey.toString()`) which may not be sufficiently random or strong. This could allow an attacker to guess or brute-force the key and decrypt sensitive data.

**Recommendations:**

* Avoid hardcoding credentials in your code. Instead, use a secure key management system to generate and store encryption keys.
* Use a secure random number generator to generate a cryptographically strong encryption key. The key should be at least 256 bits long.
