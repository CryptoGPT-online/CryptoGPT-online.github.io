    "description": "Hardcoding the key length to 16 bytes is not secure as it is too short for AES encryption. AES-128 requires a 16-byte key, AES-192 requires a 24-byte key and AES-256 requires a 32-byte key.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random key with sufficient length based on the desired security level. For AES, it is recommended to use AES-256 with a 32-byte key."
