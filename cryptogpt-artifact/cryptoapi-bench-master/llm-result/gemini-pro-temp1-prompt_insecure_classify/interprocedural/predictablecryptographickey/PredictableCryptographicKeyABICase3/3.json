    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The key size for AES is fixed to 16 bytes, while the provided key is likely much shorter and is padded with zeros. This weakens the encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a cryptographically secure key using a secure random number generator and ensure that the key length matches the required key size for the chosen encryption algorithm."
