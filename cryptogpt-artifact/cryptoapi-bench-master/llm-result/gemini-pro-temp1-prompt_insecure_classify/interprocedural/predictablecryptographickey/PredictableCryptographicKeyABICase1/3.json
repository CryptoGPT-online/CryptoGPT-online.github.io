    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The key size for AES is fixed at 16 bytes (128 bits), which is considered to be insufficient for modern cryptographic applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES-256. Also use a unique key for each encryption operation, and store the key securely."
