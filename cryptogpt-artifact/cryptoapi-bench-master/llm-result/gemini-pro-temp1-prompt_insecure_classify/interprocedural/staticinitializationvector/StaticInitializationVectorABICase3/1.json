    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses `KeyGenerator.generateKey()` to generate a secret key for AES encryption. However, it does not specify the key size or any source of randomness, which could result in weak or predictable keys.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this, a strong and cryptographically secure random number generator should be used to generate the key. Additionally, the key size should be set to a secure value, such as 256 bits for AES."
