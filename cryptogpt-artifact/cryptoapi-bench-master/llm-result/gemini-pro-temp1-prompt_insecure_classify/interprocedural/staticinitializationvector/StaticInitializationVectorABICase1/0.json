    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses `KeyGenerator.generateKey()` to generate a key for AES encryption without specifying a source of randomness. This is insecure because the generated key may be predictable, making it easier for an attacker to break the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used to generate a random key. This can be achieved by using `SecureRandom` class provided by Java."

    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses the CBC mode of operation for AES encryption, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. This mode of operation should not be used for encrypting sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, a more secure mode of operation, such as GCM, should be used instead."
