    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses the MD2 algorithm for message digesting, which is a weak and insecure cryptographic algorithm. MD2 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is relatively easy to find two different messages that produce the same digest.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD2."
