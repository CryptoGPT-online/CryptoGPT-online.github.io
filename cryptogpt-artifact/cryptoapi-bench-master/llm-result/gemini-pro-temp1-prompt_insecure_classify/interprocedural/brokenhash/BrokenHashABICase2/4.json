    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that two different messages can produce the same hash value. This makes it unsuitable for applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD5."
