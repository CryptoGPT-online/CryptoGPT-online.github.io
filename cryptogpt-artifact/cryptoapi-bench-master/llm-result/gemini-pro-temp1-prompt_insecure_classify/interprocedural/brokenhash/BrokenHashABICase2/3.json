    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered to be cryptographically broken and should not be used for new applications. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
