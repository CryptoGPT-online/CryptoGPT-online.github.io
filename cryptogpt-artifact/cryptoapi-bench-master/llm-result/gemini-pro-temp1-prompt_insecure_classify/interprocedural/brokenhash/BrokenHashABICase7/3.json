    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm for hashing, which is a broken and insecure cryptographic algorithm. MD4 is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output. This makes it unsuitable for use in security applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
