    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code is using the `MD5` algorithm, which is known to be insecure and vulnerable to collision attacks. Attackers can easily find two different inputs that produce the same MD5 hash, allowing them to bypass authentication or integrity checks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the `MD5` algorithm with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`."
