    "description": "The code uses the MD2 algorithm for message digesting, which is considered broken and insecure. MD2 is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that two different messages can produce the same digest.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the usage of MD2 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
