    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the SHA-1 algorithm for hashing, which is considered broken and no longer secure. SHA-1 is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that two different inputs can produce the same hash output.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of SHA-1."
