    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses a MessageDigest instance with the algorithm specified by the value of the `crypto` array. The `crypto` array is initialized with the value of the `CRYPTO` array, which is in turn initialized with the value of the `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` constant, which is set to \"SHA1\". SHA1 is a cryptographic hash function that is considered broken and should not be used for security purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
