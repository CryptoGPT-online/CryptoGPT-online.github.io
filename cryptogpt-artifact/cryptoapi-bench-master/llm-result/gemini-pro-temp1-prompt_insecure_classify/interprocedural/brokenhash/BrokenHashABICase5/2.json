    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The `MessageDigest` instance is created using the `crypto` variable, which can be modified by the `go2()` and `go3()` methods. This allows an attacker to change the hashing algorithm dynamically. If the attacker can control the value of `crypto`, they could select a weaker or less secure hashing algorithm to compromise the integrity of the data being hashed.",
    "recommendation": "Use a constant or secure value for the hashing algorithm instead of allowing it to be modified dynamically."
