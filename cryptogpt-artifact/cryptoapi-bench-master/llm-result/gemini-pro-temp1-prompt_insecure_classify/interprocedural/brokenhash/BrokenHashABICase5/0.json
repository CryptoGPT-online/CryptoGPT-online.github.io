There is one crypto API misuse found in the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses the SHA1 algorithm for hashing, which is considered insecure due to collision attacks. SHA1 has been deprecated and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Replace SHA1 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
  }
]
```

**CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**

* **Vulnerable Code:** `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));`
* **Description:** The code uses the `SHA1` algorithm for hashing, which is considered insecure due to collision attacks. `SHA1` has been deprecated and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.
* **Recommendation:** Replace `SHA1` with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`.
