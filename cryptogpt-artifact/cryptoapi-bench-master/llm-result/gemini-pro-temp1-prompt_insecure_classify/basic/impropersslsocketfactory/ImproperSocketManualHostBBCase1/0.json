    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();\nSSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(\"my.host.name\", 443);",
    "description": "The code uses the default SSLSocketFactory without any configuration, which means it will accept any certificate presented by the server, including self-signed or expired certificates. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, you should configure the SSLSocketFactory to validate the server's certificate against a trusted certificate authority (CA). This can be done by setting the socket factory's trust manager to a TrustManager that verifies the certificate chain."
