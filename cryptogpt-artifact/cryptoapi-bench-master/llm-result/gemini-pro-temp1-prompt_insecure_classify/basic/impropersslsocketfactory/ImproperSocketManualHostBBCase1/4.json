    "description": "Using the default SSLSocketFactory may result in a less secure algorithm being selected during the SSL/TLS handshake. This can happen if the default algorithm is weak or outdated, or if the server and client do not support the same set of algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure SSLSocketFactory implementation, such as one that uses TLS 1.2 or higher and strong ciphers."
