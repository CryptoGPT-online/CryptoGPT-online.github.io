    "description": "The password used to load the keystore is generated using a `SecureRandom` object, but the seed used to initialize the `SecureRandom` object is not specified. This means that the same password will be generated every time the program is run, which is a security risk.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator that is initialized with a strong seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate the password."
