    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "`ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), password.toCharArray())`",
    "description": "Using `KeyStore.load` with a URL as the input stream and a randomly generated password is not a secure practice. This code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker could intercept the connection and inject their own certificate into the keystore.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to load the keystore, such as using a `FileInputStream` with a password protected keystore file."
