    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\");",
    "description": "The MD2 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be used to bypass cryptographic protections and compromise the security of a system.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
