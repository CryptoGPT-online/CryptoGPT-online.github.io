    "vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();",
    "description": "The `Random` class uses a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to attack and should not be used for generating cryptographic keys or other sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) instead. For example, you can use the `SecureRandom` class in Java."
