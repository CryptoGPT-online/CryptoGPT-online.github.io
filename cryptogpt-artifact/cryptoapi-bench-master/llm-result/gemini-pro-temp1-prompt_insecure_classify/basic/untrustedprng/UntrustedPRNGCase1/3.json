    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();",
    "description": "The `Random` class uses a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which may not be cryptographically secure. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the generated random values are used for security-sensitive purposes, such as generating encryption keys or session tokens.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure PRNG instead. The `SecureRandom` class is an implementation of a cryptographically secure PRNG in Java."
