    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n        return true;\n    }",
    "description": "The code always returns true for any hostname and SSL session, which means that it does not perform any certificate validation. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate website and intercept the user's traffic.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that validates the server's certificate against a list of trusted certificates or by checking the certificate's signature and expiration date."
