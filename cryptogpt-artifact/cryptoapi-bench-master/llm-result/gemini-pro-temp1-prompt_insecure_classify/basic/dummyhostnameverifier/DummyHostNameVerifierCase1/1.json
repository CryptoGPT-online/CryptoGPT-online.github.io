    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n        return true;\n    }",
    "description": "This code always returns `true` for any hostname and SSL session, which means that it does not perform any certificate validation. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate website and intercept communications between the client and the server.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation by checking the hostname and the certificate chain against a list of trusted certificates."
