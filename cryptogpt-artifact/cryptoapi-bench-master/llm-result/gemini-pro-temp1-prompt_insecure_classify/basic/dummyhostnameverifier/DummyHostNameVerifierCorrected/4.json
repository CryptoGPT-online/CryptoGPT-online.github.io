    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "The code uses the default hostname verifier (`HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier()`) to verify the hostname of the SSL session. This default verifier does not perform any hostname validation, which means that any hostname can be spoofed and the connection will be considered valid. An attacker could use this to impersonate a legitimate website and trick users into providing sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stricter hostname verifier that checks the hostname against a list of trusted certificates or performs additional validation."
