    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "The code uses `HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier()` to verify the hostname of the SSL session, which does not perform any certificate validation. This means that the server hostname can be spoofed, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a hostname verifier that performs certificate validation, such as `HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultSSLSocketFactory().getHostnameVerifier()`, or implement your own hostname verifier that checks the certificate chain and hostname."
