    "description": "Creating a SecretKeySpec with a key derived from a String is insecure, as it uses the platform's default character encoding, which may not be suitable for cryptographic purposes. Additionally, the key is not sufficiently random, as it is derived from a static password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a key. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to generate a cryptographically strong random key."
