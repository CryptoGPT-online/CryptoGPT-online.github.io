    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom.nextBytes` to generate a 32-byte salt, but the `SecureRandom` instance is not properly initialized. This can result in a weak salt that is more vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Always create a `SecureRandom` instance using a strong seed, such as the system's `SecureRandom` or a `ThreadLocalRandom` instance."
