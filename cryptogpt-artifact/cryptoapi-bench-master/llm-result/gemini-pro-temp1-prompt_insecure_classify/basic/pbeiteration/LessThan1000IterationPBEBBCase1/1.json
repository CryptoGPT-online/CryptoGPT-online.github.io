    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom.nextBytes()` to generate a salt for a password-based encryption (PBE) scheme. However, the salt is only 32 bytes long, which is not sufficient to ensure adequate randomness.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the salt length to at least 64 bytes, or use a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom` with a strong seed."
