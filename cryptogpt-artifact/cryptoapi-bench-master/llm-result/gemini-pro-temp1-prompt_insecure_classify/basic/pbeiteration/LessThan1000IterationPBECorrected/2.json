    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used without specifying a seed, which may result in predictable or weak randomness. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if the generated random values are used for cryptographic purposes, such as generating encryption keys or salts.",
    "recommendation": "To address this issue, you should use a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom` with a cryptographically secure seed, or use a library that provides cryptographically secure random number generation, such as `bouncycastle`."

    "description": "The number of iterations used in the key derivation function (KDF) is too low. This can make it easier for an attacker to brute-force the encryption key.",
    "recommendation": "To address this issue, you should increase the number of iterations to at least 10,000."
