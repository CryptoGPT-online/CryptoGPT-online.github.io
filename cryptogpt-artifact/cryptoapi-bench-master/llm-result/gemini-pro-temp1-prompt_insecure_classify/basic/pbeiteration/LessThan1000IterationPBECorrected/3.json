    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a salt, but it only generates 32 bytes of random data. This is not enough to guarantee that the salt is sufficiently random and unique. An attacker could potentially guess the salt and compromise the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a salt that is at least 128 bits (16 bytes) in length. One way to do this is to use the `SecureRandom.generateSeed()` method to generate a seed and then pass the seed to the `SecureRandom` constructor."
