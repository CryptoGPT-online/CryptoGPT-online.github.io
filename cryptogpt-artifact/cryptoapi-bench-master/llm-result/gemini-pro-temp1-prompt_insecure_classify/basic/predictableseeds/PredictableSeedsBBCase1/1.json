    "description": "The `SecureRandom` instance is seeded with a fixed value (`bytes`), which makes the generated random numbers predictable and insecure. Setting the seed of a `SecureRandom` instance should be done with a truly random source, such as `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure source of randomness to seed the `SecureRandom` instance, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` or `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems."
