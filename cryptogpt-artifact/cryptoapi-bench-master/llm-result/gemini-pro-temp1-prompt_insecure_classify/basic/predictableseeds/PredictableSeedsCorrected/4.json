    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nlong l = sr.nextLong();\nsr.setSeed(l);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. However, `setSeed()` method is used to set the seed value for the random number generator, which makes the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed value for the `SecureRandom` class. For example, you can use a combination of system time, a random UUID, and a hardware-based random number generator (if available) to generate the seed value."
