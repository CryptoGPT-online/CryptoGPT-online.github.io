    "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The code generates a password using `random.ints()`, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. This means that the generated password may be predictable and thus weak.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, like `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate the password."

    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), new String(keyBytes).toCharArray());",
    "description": "The code loads the keystore using a hardcoded password stored in the `keyBytes` variable. This is insecure because the password is visible in the source code and can be easily extracted by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding credentials in the code. Instead, use a secure way to store and retrieve them, such as a key management system or a password manager."
