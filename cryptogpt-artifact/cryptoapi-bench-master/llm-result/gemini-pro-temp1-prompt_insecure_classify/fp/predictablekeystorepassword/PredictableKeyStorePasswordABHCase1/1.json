    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom.ints()` to generate a password. However, `ints()` generates a stream of pseudorandom ints, which is not suitable for generating cryptographically strong passwords.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.generateSeed()` or `SecureRandom.nextBytes()`."

    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "description": "The code instantiates a `KeyStore` without specifying a specific algorithm. This may result in a less-secure algorithm being selected by default.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a strong algorithm for the `KeyStore`, such as `JKS` or `PKCS12`."
