    "description": "The code uses a predictable and insecure method to generate the password for the key store. The `SecureRandom.ints()` method generates a stream of pseudorandom int values, but it is not suitable for generating cryptographic keys or passwords. It is recommended to use a strong random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.generateSeed(int numBytes)`, to generate a cryptographically secure password.",
