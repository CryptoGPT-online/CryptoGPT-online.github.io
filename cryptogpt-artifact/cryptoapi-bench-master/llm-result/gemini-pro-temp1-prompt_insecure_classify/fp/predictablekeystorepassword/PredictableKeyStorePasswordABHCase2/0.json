    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded string (\"aaa\") to retrieve a key from a HashMap. This is a security risk because the key is now exposed in the code and could be easily compromised.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding the key, it should be dynamically generated or retrieved from a secure source."
