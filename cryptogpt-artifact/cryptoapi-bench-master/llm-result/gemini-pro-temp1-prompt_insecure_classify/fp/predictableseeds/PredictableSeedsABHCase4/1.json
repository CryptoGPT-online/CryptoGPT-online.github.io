    "description": "Using `SecureRandom` with a single byte as a seed is not secure. An attacker could easily guess the seed and predict the output of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed for `SecureRandom`, such as a combination of multiple sources of entropy, including system time, process ID, and hardware-generated random numbers."
