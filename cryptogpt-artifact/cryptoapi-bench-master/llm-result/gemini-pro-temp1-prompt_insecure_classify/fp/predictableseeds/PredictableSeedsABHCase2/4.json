    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");\nbyte [] seed = {b,b};",
    "description": "The code uses a hash map to get a byte value and then uses that value as a seed for a SecureRandom object. This is not a good source of randomness, as the hash map value is not truly random and can be easily guessed or manipulated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure source of randomness, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate random values."
