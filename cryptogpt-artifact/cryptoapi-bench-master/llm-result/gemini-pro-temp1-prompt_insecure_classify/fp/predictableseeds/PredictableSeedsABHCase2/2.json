    "description": "The code generates a seed for a SecureRandom object using a single byte from a hash map. This is not a sufficiently random seed and could lead to predictable random numbers being generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating a seed for the SecureRandom object, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed() or SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
