    "description": "The code uses a SecureRandom object with a seed that is derived from a single byte value. This makes the random number generator predictable and easy to guess.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as one that uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or a hardware random number generator (HRNG)."
