    "description": "The same byte value is used as the salt for the PBEParameterSpec, which is not sufficiently random. This makes the encryption process less secure and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a truly random and unpredictable source of randomness, such as a hardware random number generator (RNG), to generate the salt value for the PBEParameterSpec."
