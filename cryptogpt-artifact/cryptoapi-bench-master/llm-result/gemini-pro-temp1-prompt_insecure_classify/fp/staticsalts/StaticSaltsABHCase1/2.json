    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");",
    "description": "The code uses a HashMap to store byte values. It then retrieves one of these values and uses it as the salt for a PBEParameterSpec. Since the HashMap is not initialized with any specific values, the salt value obtained from the HashMap is not cryptographically strong and may be predictable, making the encryption less secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a salt value for the PBEParameterSpec. This will ensure that the salt value is unpredictable and provides adequate security."
