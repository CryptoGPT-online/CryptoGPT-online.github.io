    "description": "The code uses a byte value retrieved from a HashMap as a component of the salt for a PBEParameterSpec. This is not a cryptographically secure source of randomness, as the HashMap can be manipulated to return a predictable value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the salt, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and avoid using values from HashMaps or other non-random sources."
