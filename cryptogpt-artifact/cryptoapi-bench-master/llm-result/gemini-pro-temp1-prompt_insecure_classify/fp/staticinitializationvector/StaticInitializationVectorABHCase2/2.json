    "description": "The code is using the bytes of the string `str` as the initialization vector (IV) for the cipher. This is not a secure way to generate an IV, as it is not truly random and can be easily guessed by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the IV, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. For example:\n```\nIvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().generateSeed(16));\n```"
