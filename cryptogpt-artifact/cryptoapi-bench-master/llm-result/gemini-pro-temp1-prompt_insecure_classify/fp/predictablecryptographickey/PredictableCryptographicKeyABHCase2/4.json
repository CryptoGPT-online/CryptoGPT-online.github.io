    "misuse": "CWE-326: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "`byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);`",
    "description": "The code generates the key bytes for the `AES` algorithm by simply copying the bytes of the password. This is not a secure way to generate key bytes, as it does not add any randomness to the key. An attacker could easily guess the key bytes if they know the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the key bytes. For example, you could use the `SecureRandom` class in the Java security package."
