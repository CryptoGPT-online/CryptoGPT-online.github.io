    "description": "The code is bypassing the hostname verification for the IP address \"192.168.0.10\". This could allow a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, where someone can intercept and change the connection between the client and the server.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of bypassing the hostname verification for a particular IP address, use a hostname verification library or framework. These libraries can handle the hostname verification securely."
