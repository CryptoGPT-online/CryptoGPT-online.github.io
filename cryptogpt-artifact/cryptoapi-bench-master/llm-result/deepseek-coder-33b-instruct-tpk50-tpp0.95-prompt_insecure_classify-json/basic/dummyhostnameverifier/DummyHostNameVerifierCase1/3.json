    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {return true;}",
    "description": "The certificate validation is not performed in this code. This code implies that the certificate is trusted automatically and does not perform any validation.",
    "recommendation": "Perform certificate validation by calling the following methods on the SSLSession object: getPeerCertificates(), getLocalCertificates(), or getPeerCertificateChain(). This will return an array of certificates, where the first element in the array is your client certificate and the last element is the root certificate authority (CA). You can then call the getIssuerDN() method on the certificate to retrieve the issuer distinguished name (DN). You can then compare this DN with the expected DN to confirm that the certificate is indeed trusted."
