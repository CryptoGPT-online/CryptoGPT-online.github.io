From the provided code and misuses, the following is the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse_category": "Insecure Randomness",
        "vulnerable_method": "P2.main(String[])",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
        "description": "The seed for the SecureRandom instance is not randomly generated and could be easily predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a randomly generated seed with a byte array that is longer than 1 byte. A SecureRandom instance without a seed uses the system-specific implementation, which is designed to be cryptographically strong."
    }
]
```

Regarding the false positive misuses:
1. "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" reported in the JSON format. This is a false positive misuse. The provided code does not expose any misuse of insecure randomness due to the hardcoded seed of `100`.
2. The second false positive misuse is also related to the insecure randomness, but this time the report is that the seed used is less than 8 bytes. However, the provided code does not use a seed at all, but uses a system-specific implementation which is designed to be cryptographically strong.
3. The third misuse seems to be a false positive too, as the code now uses a system-specific implementation for the SecureRandom instance and doesn't expose any misuse of insecure randomness.
