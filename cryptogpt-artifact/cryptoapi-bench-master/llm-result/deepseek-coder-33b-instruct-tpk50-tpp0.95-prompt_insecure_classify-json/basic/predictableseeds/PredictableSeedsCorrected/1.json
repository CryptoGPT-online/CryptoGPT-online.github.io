        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nlong l = sr.nextLong();\nsr.setSeed(l);",
        "description": "The SecureRandom class in Java is used to generate strong random numbers. However, using the random number generated from SecureRandom to set the seed is not recommended as it can potentially lead to predictable or insecure results. This issue is due to the fact that the seed value used is not being generated using a secure random number generator.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of manually setting the seed, it is better to allow the SecureRandom class to auto-generate the seed value. Simply remove the lines sr.setSeed(l) and only use sr.nextInt() and other relevant methods to generate the required random numbers."
