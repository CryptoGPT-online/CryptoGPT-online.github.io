        "description": "The use of SecureRandom to generate random numbers without a seed is not recommended as this can make the generator predictable and result in insufficient randomness. The method `nextLong()` can be used to seed a random number generator in applications where a single random number is needed.",
        "recommendation": "Use `SecureRandom` to seed a `SecureRandom` instance. Or if just a single random number is needed, use `SecureRandom.nextLong()` or `SecureRandom.nextInt()` directly. You may also consider the SecureRandom's `getInstanceStrong()` method."
