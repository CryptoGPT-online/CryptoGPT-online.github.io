        "vulnerable_code": "int x = randomGenerator.nextInt();",
        "description": "The use of `java.util.Random` for generating random numbers in Java is considered insecure as it uses a weak random number generation algorithm, which can lead to predictable sequences or repetitions. `java.util.Random` uses a linear congruential generator which is fast but has a small state space, meaning the lower the bits in the seed, the lower the period of repetition of the generated values. This makes it easier to predict the next random number based on the previously generated one.",
        "recommendation": "Use `java.security.SecureRandom` instead of `java.util.Random` for generating secure random numbers. It uses a cryptographically strong random number generation algorithm and is suitable for generating keys, salts, or any other secure random data."
