        "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
        "description": "The AES encryption algorithm used here has a key length of 128 bits. However, the given default key is only 13 bytes long which is less than 128 bits. This can potentially lead to the key being guessed if the key space is not significantly reduced.",
        "recommendation": "AES-128 encryption should always use keys that are 128 bits (16 bytes) long. It's recommended to use a larger, more complex key and store it securely."
