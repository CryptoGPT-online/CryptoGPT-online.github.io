### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

"vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());"

The misuse is not correct. Here, SecureRandom class's `ints` method is used to generate random integer values, but it does not produce truly random output as the method returns an IntStream and conversion to String does not guarantee true randomness. For truly random values, we should use a suitable random number generation method.
