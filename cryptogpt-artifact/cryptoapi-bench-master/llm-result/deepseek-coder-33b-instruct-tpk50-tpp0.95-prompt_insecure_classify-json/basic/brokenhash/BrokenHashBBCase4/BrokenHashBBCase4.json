### False Positive Misuse
{
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "B4.main",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\")",
    "description": "The MD2 cryptographic hash algorithm is considered to be insecure and unfit for modern cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure hashing algorithm. SHA-256 is a good choice."
}

        "description": "The use of MD2 as a cryptographic hash function is considered to be weak and risks may be exploited by attackers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure, stronger hash algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead. Also consider using a proper cryptographic library that provides secure hash functions."
