{
  "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
  "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
  "description": "The code is using SHA1, which is a cryptographic hash function that is vulnerable to hash collision attacks. This means that an attacker could generate two different messages that have the same hash. It is also vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This is because the output of SHA1 is only 160 bits long, which can be easily bruteforced using a modern computer in a reasonable time.",
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a stronger cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256. You can replace 'SHA1' with 'SHA-256' in your getInstance method."
