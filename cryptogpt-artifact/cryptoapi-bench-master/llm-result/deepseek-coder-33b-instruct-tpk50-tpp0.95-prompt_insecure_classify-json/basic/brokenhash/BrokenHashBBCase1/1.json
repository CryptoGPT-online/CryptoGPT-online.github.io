    "description": "The SHA1 algorithm is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes. It is now considered weak and should not be used for secure applications. It can be exploited through length extension attacks.",
    "recommendation": "You should replace \"SHA1\" with a stronger algorithm like SHA-256, SHA-3, or even better, bcrypt."
