        "description": "MD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function, but it is now considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use. Using MD5 can lead to various problems such as collisions, preimage attacks, etc. This code is using MD5 as a cryptographic hash function which is a problem as MD5 is considered insecure.",
        "recommendation": "You should not use MD5 anymore because it is considered insecure. Instead, use a stronger hash function like SHA-256. Also, consider using a higher iteration count for the key derivation function when using PBKDF2."
