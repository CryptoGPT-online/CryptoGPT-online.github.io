        "description": "The code is using the MD4 hashing algorithm, which is considered weak and broken. MD4 algorithm was designed in 1990 and it is known that it has some weaknesses and is easily crackable. This can allow an attacker to generate MD4 hash collisions.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm such as SHA-256. Replace \"MD4\" with \"SHA-256\"."
