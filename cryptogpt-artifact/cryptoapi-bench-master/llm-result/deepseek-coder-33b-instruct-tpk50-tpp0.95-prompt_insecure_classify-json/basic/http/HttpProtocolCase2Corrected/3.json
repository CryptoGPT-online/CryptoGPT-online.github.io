[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)", "description": "This code constructs a URL object. The hostname in this URL is hardcoded. If there are any certificate errors (e.g. self-signed certificate), they won't be caught and the connection may not be secure. Also, it doesn't verify if the hostname is correct or not which can lead to potential phishing attacks or MITM attacks. ", "recommendation": "It's recommended to implement a mechanism to verify the certificate or use libraries such as OkHttp that perform this validation for you."}]
