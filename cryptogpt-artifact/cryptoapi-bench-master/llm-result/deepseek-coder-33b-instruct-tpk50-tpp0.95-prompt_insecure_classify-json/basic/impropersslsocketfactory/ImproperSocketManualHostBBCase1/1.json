	"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
	"vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
	"description": "The Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) framework uses a default SSLContext that may not be configured with the strongest cipher suites. This can potentially lead to the use of weaker encryption methods which can be susceptible to attacks.",
	"recommendation": "When creating a new SSLContext, you should specify a list of supported protocols and cipher suites. You can use the getSupportedSSLParameters method to get a list of all supported protocols and cipher suites. Then, you can use the setSSLParameters method to set the desired protocols and cipher suites."
