### False Positive Misuse

```json
[{
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
    "description": "This is a false positive. The reported misuse is not applicable to the provided code. SSLSocketFactory.getDefault() retrieves the default SSLSocketFactory. The misuse applies to the SSLSocket object created from this factory.",
