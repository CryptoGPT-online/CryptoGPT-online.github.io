    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code is using DES which is a symmetric block cipher algorithm and it is considered a risky cryptographic algorithm for various reasons including its small key size (only 56 bits), leading to it's susceptibility to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "You should consider using a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES. AES is the current standard and widely accepted encryption algorithm. It provides a larger key space (128, 192 or 256 bits) which significantly increases the complexity of the encryption process, making it harder to crack the encryption."
