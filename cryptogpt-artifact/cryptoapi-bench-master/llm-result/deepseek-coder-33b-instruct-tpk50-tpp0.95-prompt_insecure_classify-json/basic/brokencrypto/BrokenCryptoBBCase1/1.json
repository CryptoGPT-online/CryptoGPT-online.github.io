    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\"); Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The DES algorithm, though ubiquitously used in early cryptography courses and textbooks, is considered weak and broken for most cryptographic purposes. It has a 56-bit key size which is much smaller than modern standards like AES (which is 128-bits or higher).",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger encryption standard, such as AES. If AES isn't appropriate for your particular use case due to speed or storage concerns, you might need to look into a more complex encryption method, such as RSA or Elliptic Curve encryption."
