        "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm that is recommended by the Java cryptography architecture. Consider algorithms like AES or RSA. Also, make sure to use a secure mode such as AES/GCM/NoPadding, rather than just AES. This mode provides both confidentiality and integrity."

        "description": "The RC4 algorithm requires a unique key per encryption operation to prevent pattern recognition attacks. However, in the code, a key is generated without any seed, making it likely that the same key will be used for multiple encryptions.",
