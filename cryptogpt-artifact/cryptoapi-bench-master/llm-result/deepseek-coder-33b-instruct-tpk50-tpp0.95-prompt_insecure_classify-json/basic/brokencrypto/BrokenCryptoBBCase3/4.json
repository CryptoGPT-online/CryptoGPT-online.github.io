[{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\");",
"description": "The RC4 algorithm is considered broken and it is no longer considered secure for most applications. This is because the RC4 algorithm has known vulnerabilities, such as lack of diffusion and the possibility for a birthday attack.",
"recommendation": "Switch to a more secure algorithm such as AES, RSA, or another symmetric encryption algorithm. The recommended key length for AES is 128, 192, or 256 bits, and the recommended minimum length for RSA is 2048 bits."
