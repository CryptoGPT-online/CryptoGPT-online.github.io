        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");",
        "description": "Blowfish is a symmetric key block cipher that is highly resistant to brute-force attacks but has a short key length. Its length is 64 bits or 8 bytes. The code is using Blowfish algorithm which is a weak cryptographic algorithm. It's recommended to use stronger encryption algorithms like AES. In Java, the recommended algorithm is AES with a key length of 256 bits.",
        "recommendation": "Replace Blowfish algorithm with AES. Use KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\"); to get a key of 256 bits length."
