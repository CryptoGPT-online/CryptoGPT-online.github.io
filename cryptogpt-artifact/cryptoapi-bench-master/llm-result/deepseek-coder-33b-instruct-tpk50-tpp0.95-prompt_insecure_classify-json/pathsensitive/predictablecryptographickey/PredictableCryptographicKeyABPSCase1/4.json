        "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\n\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
        "description": "The code is setting the key length to 16 bytes, which is considered too short for AES encryption. AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, which corresponds to 16, 24, and 32 bytes respectively. A key of 16 bytes (128 bits) is too short and is considered weak for secure encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Consider increasing the key size to 24 or 32 bytes (192 or 256 bits). However, if interoperability with other systems is needed, it may be necessary to stick with 16 bytes."
