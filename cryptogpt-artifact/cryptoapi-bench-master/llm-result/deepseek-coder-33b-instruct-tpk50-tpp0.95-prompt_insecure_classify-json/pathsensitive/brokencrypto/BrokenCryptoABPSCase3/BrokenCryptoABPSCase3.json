False Positive Misuse:

```json
{
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_method": "B3.go(int)",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\");",
    "description": "The use of the RC4 stream cipher is considered weak and insecure. It's recommended to use stronger algorithms like AES.",
    "recommendation": "Change 'RC4' to 'AES' or 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding' in the Cipher.getInstance() method."
}
```

The misuse reported is actually a false positive. The RC4 algorithm is used conditionally based on the user's choice, not universally throughout the method. Since RC4 is not used unconditionally, it can be considered a false positive.

        "description": "The use of the KeyGenerator class to generate a secret key is not strong enough for secure encryption. It's recommended to use a SecureRandom object with a strong random number generator algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a SecureRandom object to generate the secret key, for example: SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom(); KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\"); keyGen.init(256, secureRandom);"
