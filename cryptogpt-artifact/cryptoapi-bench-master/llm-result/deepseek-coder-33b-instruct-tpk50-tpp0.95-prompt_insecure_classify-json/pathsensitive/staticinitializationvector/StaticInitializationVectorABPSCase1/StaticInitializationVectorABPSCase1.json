The same IV is reused for different encryption operations, which could expose sensitive information if the encryption key is also used in the same way.",
        "recommendation": "The IV should never be reused in the same encryption. To fix this, a new unique IV should be generated for each encryption. This can be done by generating a random number or using a counter in conjunction with a nonce value."

In this case, all reported misuses are genuine and need to be addressed.
