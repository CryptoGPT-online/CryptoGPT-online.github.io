The `setSeed` method of `SecureRandom` class accepts a byte array as an input, but in the provided code, the input is a byte value `b` which is cast to a byte array `{b,b}`.

The reason this is problematic is that `b` is a single byte value, and the `setSeed` method is expecting a byte array. Because the value of `b` can't be accurately represented by a byte array, this could potentially lead to inaccurate or predictable random values being generated by the `SecureRandom` object `sr`.

Here is how you should fix this problem:

```java
byte[] seed = {b, b};
```

or

```java
byte[] seed = new byte[1];
seed[0] = b;
```

In both of these cases, a single byte value `b` is properly converted to a byte array `seed`.
