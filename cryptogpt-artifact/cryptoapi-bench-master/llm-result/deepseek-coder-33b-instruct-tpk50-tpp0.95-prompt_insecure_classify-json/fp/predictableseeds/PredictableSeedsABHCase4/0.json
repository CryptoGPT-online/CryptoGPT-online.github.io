SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{b});
```
description: The seed used in SecureRandom is not sufficiently random. The SecureRandom class's constructor takes an array of bytes as a seed, and this byte array is generated from a single byte from a hash map. This single byte might not provide enough entropy to generate a secure random number.

recommendation: SecureRandom should not be used with a single byte seed. Use a larger seed such as a sequence of bytes, or the seed from a secure random number generator. If you need to generate a random number from a hash map, consider using the hash map value as a key for another secure random number generator instead. 

Please note that the `SecureRandom` object should be treated as insecure and not used as a randomness source for security sensitive tasks such as cryptographic operations.
