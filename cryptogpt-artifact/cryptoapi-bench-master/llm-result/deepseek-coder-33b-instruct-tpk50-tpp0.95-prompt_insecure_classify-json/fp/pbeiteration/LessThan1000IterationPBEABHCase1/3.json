        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, iteration);",
        "description": "The iteration count used in the PBEParameterSpec is directly derived from user provided data (hm.get(\"bbb\")), which can lead to inadequate encryption strength. In fact, a low iteration count (e.g., 20) is not sufficient for secure applications, as it's easy for an attacker to crack the password.",
        "recommendation": "Use a high iteration count (e.g., 10000) and adjust it as needed based on the security requirements of your application. A good starting point is 1000."
