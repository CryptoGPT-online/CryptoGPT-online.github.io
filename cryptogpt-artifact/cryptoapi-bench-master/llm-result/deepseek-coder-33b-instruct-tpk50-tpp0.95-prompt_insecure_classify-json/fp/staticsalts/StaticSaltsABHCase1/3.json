        "description": "The value for the key 'aaa' is retrieved and used to create the salt. This salt seems to be deterministic and not random enough which could potentially lead to predictable outcomes and weakens the cryptographic algorithm's effectiveness.",

        "description": "The iteration count for the PBEParameterSpec is relatively low (1020), this means that the hash function will be applied less times, potentially resulting in an inadequate encryption strength.",
