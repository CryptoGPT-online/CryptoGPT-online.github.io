    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");\n\nbyte[] salt = {b,b};",
    "description": "In the given code, the salt for PBEParameterSpec is created using a Byte object as a salt. Byte values (salt) are usually created with a hardcoded value or random byte generation which can create a security issue in terms of randomness. PBEParameterSpec needs a cryptographically strong random salt or an empty array for the iterations count parameter.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a hardcoded Byte value, a random salt value should be used. This will enhance the security of the PBE algorithm."
