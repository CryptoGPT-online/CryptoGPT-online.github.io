    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(key.toCharArray(), salt, iterationCount, keyLength);",
    "description": "The iteration count is set to a low value, which makes the key generation process vulnerable to dictionary attacks and brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value that is at least 1000 times higher than the maximum expected login attempts. This will significantly increase the computational complexity and time needed to crack the encryption key."

    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(key.toCharArray(), salt, iterationCount, keyLength);",
    "description": "The code is creating a PBEKeySpec with a low iteration count which can lead to vulnerabilities when the code is running in an insecure environment.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use stronger encryption algorithms and a higher iteration count to make the system more secure against brute force attacks."

    "description": "The code is using hard-coded credentials to create a key, which is a security risk because it can be found and used by others if the code is exposed.",
    "recommendation": "Never use hardcoded credentials. Instead, use secure methods to store and retrieve credentials such as using a secure vault, environment variables, or configuration files."
