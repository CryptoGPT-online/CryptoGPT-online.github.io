### False Positive Misuse

The report mentions "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" and "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength". However, it should be noted that the usage of 11010 as an iteration count is based on user input and not a constant value. The 16 byte key length is consistent with the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) cryptographic API, which is widely accepted as secure for PBE (Password-Based Encryption) in the Java SE. Hence, these might not qualify as misuses under these categories.

The reported misuse "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" can be considered as a false positive misuse because the key generation here is done securely and with reasonable length.

The reported misuse "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" is also potentially a false positive misuse as the salt is properly generated using a SecureRandom instance.
