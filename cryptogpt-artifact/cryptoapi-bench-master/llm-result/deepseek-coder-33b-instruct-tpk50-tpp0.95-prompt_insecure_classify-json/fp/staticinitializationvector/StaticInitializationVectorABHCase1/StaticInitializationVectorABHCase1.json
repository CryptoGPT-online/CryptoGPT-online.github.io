False Positive Misuse
The misuse reported about insufficient random values and inadequate encryption strength are false positives because:
1. The IV is generated from a hardcoded string, which is inherently not random. We are only checking for hardcoded values to determine whether they are truly random or not.
2. The key size for AES is correctly specified at 256 bits, which is the recommended size for AES encryption.

The recommendation for insufficient random values is indeed to use SecureRandom class to generate a random IV for each encryption operation, but that misuse is already fixed by the suggested code.

        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "The AES algorithm is being used in CBC mode, which is not recommended due to vulnerabilities in CBC mode. CBC mode requires an Initialization Vector (IV), but in this case, it is not provided, leading to the same IV and Key being used multiple times.",
        "recommendation": "For AES, use AES/GCM or AES/CCM instead of AES/CBC. Also, make sure to provide an IV using a cryptographic secure random number generator."
