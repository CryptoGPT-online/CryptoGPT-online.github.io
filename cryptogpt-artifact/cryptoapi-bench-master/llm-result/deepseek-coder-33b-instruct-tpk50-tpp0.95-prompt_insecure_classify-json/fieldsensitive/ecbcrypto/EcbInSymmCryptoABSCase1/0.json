    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(passedAlgo);",
    "description": "The algorithm used for encryption is determined by the user-supplied input 'passedAlgo', which can be changed by an attacker. The user-supplied value is not checked or sanitized, so it can potentially be set to a less secure algorithm than intended.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a list of allowed algorithms and verify the user-supplied value against this list. If it's not in the list, use a default secure algorithm or reject the request."
