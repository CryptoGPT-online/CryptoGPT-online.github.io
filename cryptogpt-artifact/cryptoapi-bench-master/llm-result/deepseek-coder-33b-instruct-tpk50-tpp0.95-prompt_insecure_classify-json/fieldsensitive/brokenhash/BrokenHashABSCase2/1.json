        "description": "MD5 is a weak cryptographic hash function that should not be used for any secure purposes. If you are using it for anything other than archaic purposes, you should consider using a stronger hash algorithm such as SHA-256, SHA-3 or even better, Argon2.",

        "description": "Salting a password or any other sensitive data before hashing it helps to prevent dictionary and rainbow table attacks. If the salt is static or doesn't change for every password, then the hash can be cracked very quickly. This is because if two users have the same password, their hashes will be identical.",
        "recommendation": "Always use unique and random salt for each hashing operation. Don't use a static or predictable salt."

        "description": "In some cases, the use of an Initialization Vector (IV) is not necessary, for instance, in ECB mode. But for any other mode, it is essential. If not used, it can expose the data to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use an IV with every encryption operation, especially in CBC, CFB, OFB or CTR modes."
