        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a strong, up-to-date algorithm such as SHA-256, SHA-3, or RSA with 2048 or 4096 bit key length. Always choose strong encryption algorithms which are not known to be weak or broken."

        "description": "The code uses the MessageDigest class, which is a part of the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE). The MessageDigest class is used to apply a hash function to a byte array. However, it should not be used for cryptographic signing. If used for cryptographic signing, it is necessary to use an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm such as RSA with Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP).",
