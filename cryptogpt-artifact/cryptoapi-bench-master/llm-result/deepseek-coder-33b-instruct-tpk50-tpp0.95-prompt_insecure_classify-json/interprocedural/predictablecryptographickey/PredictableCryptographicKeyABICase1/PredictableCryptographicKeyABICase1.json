### False Positive Misuses:

None

### Optimized Misuse JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
        "description": "The code uses an insecure key length for the AES encryption algorithm. AES requires a 128, 192, or 256 bit key size, but the key provided is only 16 bytes which is too short.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure key length. A 128 bit key size is a good choice."

        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();",
        "description": "The key is created from a String using the getBytes() method which relies on the default platform encoding. This may not generate a sufficiently random key.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the key."

        "description": "The key is a hardcoded value, this could lead to serious security flaws and it's not good for data protection.",
        "recommendation": "The key should not be hardcoded, and should be stored securely or generated securely using a secure random number generator."
