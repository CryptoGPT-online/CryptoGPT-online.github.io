        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
        "description": "The AES algorithm requires a 128-bit (16 byte) key for full strength encryption. In this case, the key is being truncated to 16 bytes, which is less than the recommended length, thus reducing the strength of encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of truncating the key, consider using a longer key for AES encryption. If you want to use the given key, at least ensure it is long enough to meet the minimum requirements of the algorithm."
