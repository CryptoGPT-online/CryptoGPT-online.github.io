### False Positive Misuse
The following are the misuses that are false positives based on the code analysis:

1.  In `method2(String password)`, the iteration count is set to 11010 which is excessively high. However, the value 11010 is not hardcoded and is a variable value based on a method parameter. So, it can be a valid value.
    
2.  The salt generation is secure because `SecureRandom` is used.

3.  The key length in `PBEKeySpec` is 16, which is a weak value, but it can be a valid value depending on the scenario.
