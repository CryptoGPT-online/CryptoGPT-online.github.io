    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");",
    "description": "The code uses the RSA algorithm to generate key pairs. Although RSA is widely used and considered strong enough for many purposes, it is still susceptible to attacks. In particular, the RSA algorithm may be broken if either the plaintext or the private key is known. Also, it should be noted that RSA with key length less than 2048 is considered weak and deprecated.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using more secure and efficient alternatives like ECC or even AES for symmetric encryption if the requirement allows. Also, consider key size larger than 2048 for RSA. Asymmetric encryption may not be always required and symmetric encryption can be sufficient in many cases."

    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "No such API misuse in the provided code.",
    "description": "No certificate validation is performed in this code.",
    "recommendation": "If certificate validation is required, make sure to use methods provided by Java's javax.net.ssl package or a higher-level networking library."

  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "The code initializes kgp.initialize(key); with a static key size. Although, it's just an example, in real-world scenarios it would be more appropriate to use a randomly generated key size.",
    "description": "The code uses a static key size for the key pair generation. Although 1024 bits is used in this example for simplicity, it would be more appropriate to use a random key size.",
    "recommendation": "Use a random key size for key generation. Java provides the java.security.SecureRandom class for generating secure random numbers, which can be used to generate key sizes for encryption algorithms."
