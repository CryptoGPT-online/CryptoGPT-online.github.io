  "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");kgp.initialize(keysize);",
  "description": "The RSA encryption is used with a small key size (1024 bits). This is considered a weak encryption algorithm. This could allow attackers to decrypt the encrypted data easily. It is recommended to use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES with a key size of 256 bits or higher.",
  "recommendation": "Replace 'RSA' with 'AES'. Also, increase the key size to at least 2048 bits."
