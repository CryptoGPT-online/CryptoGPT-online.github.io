        "description": "The RSA key size is set to a very small value of 1024 bits which is considered insecure due to the risk of the RSA algorithm being broken with currently available computational power.",
        "recommendation": "Use a sufficiently large key size, such as 2048 bits or more, for RSA encryption. It's recommended to use a multiple of 1024 for better security."
