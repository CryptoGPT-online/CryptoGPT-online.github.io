{
  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
  "description": "The given code uses a byte as a seed for a SecureRandom object, which is not secure as the range of byte values is too small (from -128 to 127) to produce random sequences. Predictable or weak seeds can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Use a larger data type for the seed value, such as an array of bytes or a string. A larger data type will provide a larger range of values and make it harder for an attacker to guess the seed."
