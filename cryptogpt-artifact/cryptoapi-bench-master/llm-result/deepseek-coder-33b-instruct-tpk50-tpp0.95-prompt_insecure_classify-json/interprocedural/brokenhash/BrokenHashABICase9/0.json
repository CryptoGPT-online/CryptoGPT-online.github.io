    "description": "This code uses a cryptographic hash algorithm which might not be safe or secure. The SHA-1 algorithm is known to be weak and considered harmful for this reason.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger cryptographic hash algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3. In case of HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code), consider using SHA-256 or SHA-3 for HMAC computation, but also use a strong key."

    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "This code does not use a key for hashing, which is not recommended because the same input always produces the same output, making the algorithm deterministic and predictable. This can be a risk for data integrity or confidentiality, especially in contexts where the hash is used for security purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random salt or key for your hashing operation, especially if you plan to store or transmit the hash. For example, you can generate a random salt and prepend or append it to the password before hashing."
