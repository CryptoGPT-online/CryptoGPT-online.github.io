    "description": "The use of the vulnerable cryptographic algorithm 'MD2' for generating hash values makes the code susceptible to attacks. It does not provide secure cryptographic operations and is outdated.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'MD2' with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as 'SHA-256', 'SHA-384', or 'SHA-512' for generating hash values. Always ensure the choice of cryptographic algorithm aligns with the security requirements of your specific use-case."
