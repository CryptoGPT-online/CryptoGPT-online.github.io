### False Positive Misuses ###
The following are the false positives in the misuses list:

- In the first list, the misuse identified as "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" is misplaced in this context. The code uses MD5 which is not a secure cryptographic algorithm.

- In the second list, the misuse is related to the misuse in the first list but also mentions incorrect code. It says "None directly visible but related to hash algorithms", which is incorrect. The code is directly visible and contains MD5 which is not a secure cryptographic algorithm.

- The third, fourth, and fifth lists are the same as the second list but with incorrect code.
