  "description": "The cryptographic algorithm MD2 is known to be a broken or risky algorithm. It's been widely advised to avoid using MD2 and switch to stronger algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3. As a result, this may lead to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Consider replacing 'MD2' with a stronger cryptographic algorithm like 'SHA-256'. The updated code should look like this: MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");"
