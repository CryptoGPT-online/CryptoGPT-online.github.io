        "description": "The code uses the AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm to encrypt data. AES is a strong encryption algorithm, but the strength of AES can be decreased by using weak keys, which is the case here as the key is not random. Furthermore, CBC mode is not secure in many cases due to the lack of Initialization Vector (IV) randomness.",
