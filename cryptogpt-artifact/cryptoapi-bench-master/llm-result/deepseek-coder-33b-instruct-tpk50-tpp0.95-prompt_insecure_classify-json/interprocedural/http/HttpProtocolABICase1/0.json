    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
    "description": "When using a URL object to make a network connection, the system does not verify the server's SSL certificate. This could be a problem if the connection is being made to a server that is not trusted.",
    "recommendation": "If you need to make a secure connection, always verify the server's certificate. You can use libraries like Apache HttpClient to do this."
}]
```

In the given code snippet, the URL object is created without any certificate validation, which could be an issue if the connection is not secure. To avoid such misuse, consider using libraries like Apache HttpClient which support certificate validation.
