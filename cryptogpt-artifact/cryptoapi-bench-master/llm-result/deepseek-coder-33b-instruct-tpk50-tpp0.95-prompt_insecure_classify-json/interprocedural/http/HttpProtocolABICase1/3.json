        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
        "description": "This code uses a URL without validating the server's SSL certificate, which may cause potential security issues if the URL being accessed is using a self-signed or expired certificate. This can be dangerous if an attacker is able to intercept and modify the network traffic.",
        "recommendation": "Always validate the server's SSL certificate. You can use libraries like Apache HttpClient or OKHttp for this purpose. These libraries provide a way to customize SSL certificates verification process."
