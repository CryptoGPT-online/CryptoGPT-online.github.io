    "description": "The crypto argument passed to the go method is a hard-coded string 'RC4'. The RC4 algorithm is considered insecure for encryption and should not be used. Instead, strong encryption standards like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) should be used.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'RC4' with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as 'AES'. Ensure that the algorithm is suitable for your specific use-case."
