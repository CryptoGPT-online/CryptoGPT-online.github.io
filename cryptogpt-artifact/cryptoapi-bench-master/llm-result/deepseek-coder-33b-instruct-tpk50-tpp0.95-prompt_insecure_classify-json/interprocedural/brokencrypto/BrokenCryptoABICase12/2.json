This can make the application vulnerable to attacks where an attacker may discover this and then try to use a less secure algorithm for encryption.",
        "recommendation": "The cryptographic algorithm to be used should be chosen dynamically based on the security policy of the system. It should not be hardcoded. Instead, it should be configurable and the administrator should set it based on the available security policy."
