    "vulnerable_code": "sr2.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The method nextBytes() is used to generate random bytes to populate the salt array. However, in this case, the salt is initialized with a fixed value (0xa2) before calling nextBytes(). This means that if choice is not greater than 1, the salt array will still contain the fixed value and not be randomly generated.",
