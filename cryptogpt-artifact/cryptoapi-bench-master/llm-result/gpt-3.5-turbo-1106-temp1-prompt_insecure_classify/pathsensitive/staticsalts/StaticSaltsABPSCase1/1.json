[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
  "description": "The code is using a fixed salt value, which is not sufficiently random. A fixed or predictable salt value reduces the strength of the encryption algorithm and makes it more susceptible to attacks such as precomputation attacks or dictionary attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a random salt value for each encryption operation."}]
