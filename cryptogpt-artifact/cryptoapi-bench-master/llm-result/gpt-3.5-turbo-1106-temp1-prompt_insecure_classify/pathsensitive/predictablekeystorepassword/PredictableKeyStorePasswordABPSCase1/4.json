    "description": "The defaultKey is generated using SecureRandom but it is converted to a string using the default method, which may not produce a secure random value. Additionally, the defaultKey is used as the password to load the KeyStore, which may have insufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a secure and random password using a strong cryptographic algorithm and use a KeySpec object to load the KeyStore with a strong encryption algorithm."
