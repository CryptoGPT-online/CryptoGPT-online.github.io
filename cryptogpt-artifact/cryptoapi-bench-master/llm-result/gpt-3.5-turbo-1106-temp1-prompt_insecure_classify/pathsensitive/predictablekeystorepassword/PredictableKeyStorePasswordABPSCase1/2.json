[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
  "description": "The default key is generated using the SecureRandom class, but the key length is not specified. This can lead to a weak key with insufficient encryption strength.",
  "recommendation": "Generate a key with sufficient length to ensure strong encryption strength. Example: byte[] key = new byte[16]; random.nextBytes(key);"}]
