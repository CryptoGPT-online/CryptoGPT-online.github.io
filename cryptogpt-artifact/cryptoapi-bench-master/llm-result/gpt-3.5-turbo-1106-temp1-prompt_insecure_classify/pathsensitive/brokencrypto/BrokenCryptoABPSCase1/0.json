    "description": "The code is using a DES encryption algorithm in ECB mode, which is known to be insecure. ECB mode does not provide proper encryption and can lead to security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the code allows the use of AES encryption algorithm in CBC mode based on a user-controlled choice.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a secure mode of operation like CBC."
