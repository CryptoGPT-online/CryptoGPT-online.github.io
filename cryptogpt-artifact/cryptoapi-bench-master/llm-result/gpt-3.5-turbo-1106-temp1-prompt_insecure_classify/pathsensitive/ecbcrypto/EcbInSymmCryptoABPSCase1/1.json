    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "description": "The code uses the AES encryption algorithm which is considered safe, but it does not specify the key size. By default, it uses a key size of 128 bits which may not be considered secure for some applications.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the desired key size when generating the key using KeyGenerator.init(int keySize). For example, for 256-bit key length, use keyGen.init(256) before calling keyGen.generateKey()"
