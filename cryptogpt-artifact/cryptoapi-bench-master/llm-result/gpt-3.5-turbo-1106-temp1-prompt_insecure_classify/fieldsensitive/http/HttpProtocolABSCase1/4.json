    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(passedURL));",
    "description": "The code is directly using the passedURL parameter to create a new URL object without performing any validation or verification on the URL. This can lead to improper certificate validation if the passedURL parameter is controlled by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Perform proper validation and verification on the passedURL parameter before using it to create a new URL object. This includes checking the SSL/TLS certificate validity, verifying the server identity, and ensuring the use of secure connection protocols (e.g., HTTPS)."
