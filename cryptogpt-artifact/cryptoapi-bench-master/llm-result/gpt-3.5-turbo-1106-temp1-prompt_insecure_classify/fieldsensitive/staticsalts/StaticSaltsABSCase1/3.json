    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "passedSalt = defSalt;",
    "description": "The code assigns a fixed, hardcoded salt value (`defSalt`) to the `passedSalt` variable, which is then used in the creation of the `PBEParameterSpec` object. The hardcoded salt value reduces the randomness and unpredictability of the salt, weakening the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong, random salt using a secure random number generator."
