    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt,passedCount);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec requires a strong and random salt, but in this code, a weak and inadequate salt is generated using a SecureRandom instance. Also, the count value used for the iterations in the password-based encryption is hardcoded to the value of passedCount, which may not be a secure and sufficient value.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong and random salt using a cryptographically secure random number generator. Use an iteration count that is appropriate for the chosen encryption algorithm. Consider using a well-established and approved encryption algorithm."
