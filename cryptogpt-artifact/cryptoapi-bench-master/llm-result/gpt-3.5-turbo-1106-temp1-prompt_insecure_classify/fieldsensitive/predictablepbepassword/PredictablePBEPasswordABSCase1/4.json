    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "In this code snippet, the SecureRandom class is used to generate random bytes for the salt value. However, the salt is only 16 bytes long, which may not provide sufficient randomness and uniqueness for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a longer and more random salt value, preferably generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) such as java.security.SecureRandom."
