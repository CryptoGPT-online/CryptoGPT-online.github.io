    "description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom object in C1 is only 2 bytes long, which is insufficient for providing strong encryption. The use of a short seed reduces the entropy and increases the chances of predictability and vulnerability to brute force attacks.",

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
    "description": "Using a fixed seed value or a predictable seed value can result in the generation of predictable random numbers. This can lead to vulnerabilities in encryption, such as key or IV reuse. In this case, the seed for the SecureRandom object is set to the value of passedSeed, which is assigned the value of defSeed, reducing the entropy and randomness of the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random and unpredictable seed for the SecureRandom object, and avoid using fixed or predictable values."
