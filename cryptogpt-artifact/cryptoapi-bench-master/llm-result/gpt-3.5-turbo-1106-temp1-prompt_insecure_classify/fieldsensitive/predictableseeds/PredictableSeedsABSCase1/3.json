    "description": "The setSeed method of SecureRandom sets the seed used for random number generation. In the given code, the passedSeed value is directly used as the seed which may lead to insufficiently random values.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a more secure and random source for seeding the SecureRandom instance, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed() method or SecureRandom getInstanceStrong() method."
