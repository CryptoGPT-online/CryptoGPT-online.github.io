    "description": "The seed value used for generating random numbers is hardcoded, which reduces the strength of the encryption. Hardcoded seeds increase the likelihood of the same keys being used, which can be exploited by attackers to decrypt the data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure and random source for generating the seed value, such as using SecureRandom to produce the seed instead of hardcoding it."
