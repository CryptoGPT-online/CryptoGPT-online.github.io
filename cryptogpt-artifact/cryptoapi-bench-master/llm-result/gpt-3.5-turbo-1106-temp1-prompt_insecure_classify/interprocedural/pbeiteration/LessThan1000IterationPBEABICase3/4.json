    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses the SecureRandom class to generate random bytes for the salt value. However, it is using a fixed length of 32 bytes for the salt, which may not provide sufficient entropy for strong cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure and cryptographically strong random number generator and generate a salt with sufficient entropy, such as using SecureRandom.generateSeed() or a cryptographically secure random number generator like SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
