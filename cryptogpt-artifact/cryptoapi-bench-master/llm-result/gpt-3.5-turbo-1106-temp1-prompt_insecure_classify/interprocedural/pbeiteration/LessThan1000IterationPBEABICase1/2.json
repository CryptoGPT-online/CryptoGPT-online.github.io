    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is used with a count parameter, which indicates the number of iterations to be performed for deriving the key. However, the value of the count parameter is not securely chosen and is directly passed as-is. This can weaken the security of the encryption process.",
    "recommendation": "Use a larger and securely chosen value for the count parameter instead of directly using the passed input."
