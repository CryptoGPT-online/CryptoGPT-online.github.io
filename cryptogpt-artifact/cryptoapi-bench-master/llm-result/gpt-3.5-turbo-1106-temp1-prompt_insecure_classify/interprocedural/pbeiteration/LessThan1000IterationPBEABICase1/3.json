    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt)",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers and random byte arrays. In this code snippet, the random.nextBytes(salt) method is used to generate a salt for the PBEParameterSpec object. However, the length of the salt is set to 32 bytes, which might be insufficient for certain cryptographic algorithms. It is recommended to use a salt of adequate length for the chosen algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a longer salt length, such as 64 or 128 bytes, depending on the cryptographic algorithm being used."
