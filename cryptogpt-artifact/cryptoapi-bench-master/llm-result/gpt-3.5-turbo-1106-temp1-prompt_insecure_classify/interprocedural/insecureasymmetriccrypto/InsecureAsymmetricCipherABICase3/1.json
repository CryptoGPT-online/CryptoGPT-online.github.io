    "description": "The code is using the user provided key size to initialize the KeyPairGenerator. The encryption strength of the RSA algorithm depends on the key size. A key size of 1024 bits, which is being used here, is considered to be insufficiently strong for modern cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to at least 2048 bits for secure encryption."
