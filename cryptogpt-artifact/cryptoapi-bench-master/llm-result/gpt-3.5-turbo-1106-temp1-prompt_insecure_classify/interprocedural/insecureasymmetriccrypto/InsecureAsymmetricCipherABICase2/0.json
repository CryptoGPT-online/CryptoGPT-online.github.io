    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\")",
    "description": "The code uses the RSA algorithm for encryption without specifying the encryption mode and padding. This can lead to inadequate encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the encryption mode and padding explicitly, for example, replace 'Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\")' with 'Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding\")' to use RSA with ECB mode and PKCS1Padding padding."
