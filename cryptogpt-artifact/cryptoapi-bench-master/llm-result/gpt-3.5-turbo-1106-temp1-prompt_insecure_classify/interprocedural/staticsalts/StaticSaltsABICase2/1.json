    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(salt.toString())}, count);",
    "description": "The code is using salt as a byte array to initialize PBEParameterSpec. However, it is converting the salt to a string and then parsing the byte value from the string. This can result in a loss of entropy and inadequate encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of converting the salt to a string and parsing the byte value, directly use the salt as a byte array. For example, pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);"
