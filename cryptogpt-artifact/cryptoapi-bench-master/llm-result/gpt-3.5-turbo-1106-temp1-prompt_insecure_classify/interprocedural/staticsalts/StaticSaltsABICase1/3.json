    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is used with a low iteration count (e.g. 1020), which can make the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as at least 10,000 or higher."
