    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\r\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The code is using a low iteration count (1020) for key generation, which can result in weak encryption and makes it easier for attackers to guess the key. A stronger iteration count is recommended for better security.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 10,000 or higher."
