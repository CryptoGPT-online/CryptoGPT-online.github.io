    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\r\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec class is used to specify the parameters for a Password-Based Encryption (PBE) algorithm. In this code, the salt and iteration count used for the PBE encryption are set to low values. This can make the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks and reduce the strength of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a sufficiently random and unique salt for each encryption operation. Use a higher iteration count to make the encryption more computationally expensive for an attacker."
