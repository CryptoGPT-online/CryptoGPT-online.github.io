    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": " Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding. CBC mode with PKCS5Padding is considered to be a risky cryptographic algorithm because it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks and has other security issues. It is recommended to use AES with GCM mode for better security.",
    "recommendation": "Use AES/GCM/NoPadding instead of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding."
