    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm, which is considered secure. However, it does not specify the key size explicitly. Depending on the Java platform implementation, this could result in a default key size being used, which may be less than the required strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the desired key size explicitly when generating the AES key. For example, use KeyGenerator.init(int keySizeBytes) to set the key size to 128, 192, or 256 bits."
