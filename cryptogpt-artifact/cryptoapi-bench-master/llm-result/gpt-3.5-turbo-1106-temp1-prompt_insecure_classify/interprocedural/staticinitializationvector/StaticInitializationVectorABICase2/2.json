    "description": "The code is using the default key length for AES, which is 128 bits. This may not provide sufficient encryption strength for sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key length, such as 256 bits, by setting the appropriate key size parameter for the KeyGenerator instance."
