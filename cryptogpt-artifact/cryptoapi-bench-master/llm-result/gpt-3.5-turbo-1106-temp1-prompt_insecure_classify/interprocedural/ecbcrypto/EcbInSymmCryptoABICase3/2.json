    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using the \"AES\" algorithm to generate a secret key. The AES algorithm itself is not the issue, but the problem is that it is using the default mode and padding, which is ECB and PKCS5Padding. ECB mode is known to be insecure because it does not provide proper confidentiality. PKCS5Padding is also not the recommended padding scheme for AES.",
    "recommendation": "Update the code to use a secure mode and padding, such as AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding or AES/GCM/NoPadding, instead of the default."
