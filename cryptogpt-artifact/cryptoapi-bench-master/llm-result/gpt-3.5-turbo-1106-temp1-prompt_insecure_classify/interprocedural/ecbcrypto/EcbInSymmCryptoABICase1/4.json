    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses a string parameter 'crypto' to specify the cipher algorithm. It is possible for an attacker to manipulate the 'crypto' value and choose a less secure algorithm with known vulnerabilities or weaken the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the 'crypto' parameter is validated before passing it to the Cipher.getInstance() method. Restrict the allowed algorithms to those that are considered secure, and do not allow user-controlled input to specify an algorithm."
