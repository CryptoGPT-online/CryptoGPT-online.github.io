    "description": "The code is using a weak encryption algorithm (JKS) with a low encryption strength. Additionally, the key used for encryption is a hardcoded value.",
    "recommendation": "Use stronger encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) with recommended key sizes. Avoid using hardcoded keys, instead, store them securely or use dynamically generated keys."

    "description": "The code is using a hardcoded password for the encryption process. Hardcoded passwords are insecure because they can be easily discovered and exploited.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded passwords. Use secure mechanisms to store and retrieve passwords, such as using environment variables or reading from a secure configuration file."

    "description": "The code is loading the certificate from a URL (https://www.google.com) without properly validating the certificate. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a trusted certificate store and verify the server's certificate before establishing a connection. Additionally, consider using certificate pinning to further enhance security."
