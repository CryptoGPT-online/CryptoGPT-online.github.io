    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
    "description": "The method `load` of the `KeyStore` class uses a char array for the password. This can be a security vulnerability as arrays can be easily accessed and modified in memory. Additionally, the API should not use `String` or `char[]` to handle passwords as they can be potentially logged or queried from memory.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using `char[]`, it is recommended to use `java.security.KeyStore.PasswordProtection` class to handle the password. The `PasswordProtection` class provides a more secure way of handling passwords by clearing the password from memory after using it."
