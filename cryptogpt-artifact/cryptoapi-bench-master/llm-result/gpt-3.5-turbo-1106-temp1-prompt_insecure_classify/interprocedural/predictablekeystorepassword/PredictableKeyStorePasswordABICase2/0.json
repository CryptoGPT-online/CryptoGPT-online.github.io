    "misuse": "CWE-298: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), encryptKey);",
    "description": "The code is using the openStream() method of the URL class to access a remote URL (https://www.google.com) and load it into a KeyStore object (ks). However, the code does not perform any validation on the server's SSL certificate, which means it is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and cannot verify the authenticity of the server.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation by using a trust manager that verifies the SSL certificate of the server and ensure the connection is secure."

    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded encryption key (DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY) as the password to load the KeyStore object. Hardcoded credentials are vulnerable to unauthorized access and can easily be discovered by attackers.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded credentials and store sensitive information in a secure manner, such as using environment variables or encryption."
