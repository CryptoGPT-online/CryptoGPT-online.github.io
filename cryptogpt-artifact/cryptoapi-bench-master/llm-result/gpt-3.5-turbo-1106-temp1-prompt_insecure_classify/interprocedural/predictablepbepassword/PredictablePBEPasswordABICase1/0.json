    "description": "The code is generating a salt value using a byte array of length 16, which is considered insufficiently random. The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers for security-sensitive purposes and provides a more secure alternative for generating random values.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the salt value."
