    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed, predetermined seed value to initialize the SecureRandom instance, which can result in predictable and easily guessable random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "SecureRandom should be properly seeded to ensure the generation of strong random numbers. Instead of using a fixed seed value, a secure source of randomness, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), should be used to generate a random seed value."
