    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(cryptoKey);",
    "description": "The getInstance() method in the KeyGenerator class is used to obtain a KeyGenerator object that generates secret keys for the specified algorithm.This method takes the algorithm name as a parameter, not the key value itself.Using the key value directly as the algorithm name is a misuse.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the variable 'cryptoKey' with the actual algorithm name like 'DES'."
