    "description": "The code defines a constant 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO' which is used as the default cryptographic algorithm. However, using a hardcoded value for the cryptographic algorithm is considered a misuse as it limits flexibility and makes it harder to update and change the algorithm in the future.",
    "recommendation": "Use a configuration mechanism to specify the default cryptographic algorithm, allowing flexibility and ease of future updates."
