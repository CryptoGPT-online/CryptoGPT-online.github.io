    "description": "The code is using the crypto value (char array) as the algorithm for KeyGenerator.getInstance() method. However, the value of the crypto array is only assigned in the go3() method. Since go3() is called after go2() in the main method, the crypto value is null when used in KeyGenerator.getInstance().",
    "recommendation": "Make sure that the crypto value is properly assigned before being used in KeyGenerator.getInstance() method."
