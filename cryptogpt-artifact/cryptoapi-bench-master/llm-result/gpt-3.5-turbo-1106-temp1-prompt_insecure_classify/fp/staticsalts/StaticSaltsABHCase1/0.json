    "description": "The code is using a low count value (1020) for the PBEParameterSpec, which can result in weak encryption. Weak encryption can be easily cracked, compromising the security of the system.",
    "recommendation": "Use a higher count value to ensure stronger encryption. A count value of at least 10,000 is recommended for secure encryption."
