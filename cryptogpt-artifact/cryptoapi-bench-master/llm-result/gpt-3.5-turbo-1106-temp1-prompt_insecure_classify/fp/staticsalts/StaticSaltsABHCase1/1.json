[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {b,b};", 
"description": "The salt used for PBE encryption should be randomly generated and should not be derived from a single byte value. In this code, the salt is derived from the byte value 'b', which is not sufficiently random.",
"recommendation": "Generate a random salt using a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom class in Java."}]
