    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "String key = hm.get(\"aaa\");",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded value \"aaa\" as the key to retrieve a password from a hashmap. This is considered insecure as the password is easily guessable and can be obtained by analyzing the code.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to obtain passwords, such as using environment variables or retrieving them from a secure storage. Avoid hardcoding passwords or using easily guessable values as keys in data structures."
