[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The code uses random.ints() to generate a password, but the random.ints() method generates integers sequentially and does not guarantee sufficient randomness. This can result in weak and easily guessable passwords.", "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate strong random passwords."}]
