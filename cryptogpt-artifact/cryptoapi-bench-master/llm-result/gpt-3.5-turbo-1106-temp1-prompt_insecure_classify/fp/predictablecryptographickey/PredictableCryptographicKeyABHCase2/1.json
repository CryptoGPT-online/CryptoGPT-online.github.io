    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The code is using a fixed key size of 16 bytes for AES encryption. AES allows for multiple key sizes (128, 192, and 256 bits) and using a fixed key size reduces the encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a fixed key size of 16 bytes, generate a secure random key with a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits."
