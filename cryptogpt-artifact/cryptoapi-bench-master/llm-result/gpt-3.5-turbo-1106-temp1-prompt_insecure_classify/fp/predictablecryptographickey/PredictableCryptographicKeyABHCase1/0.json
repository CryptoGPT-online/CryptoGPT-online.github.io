[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The code uses the random.ints() method to generate a random key, but this method does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), to generate the key."}]
