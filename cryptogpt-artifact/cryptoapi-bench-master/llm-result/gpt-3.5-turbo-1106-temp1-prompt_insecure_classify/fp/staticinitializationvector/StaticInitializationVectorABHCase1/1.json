[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", 
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
  "description": "The code uses the AES algorithm, which is not considered broken or risky. However, it is recommended to use stronger algorithms like AES-256 for better security.",
  "recommendation": "Replace \"AES\" with \"AES-256\" to use a stronger encryption algorithm."}]
