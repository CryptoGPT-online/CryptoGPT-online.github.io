    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses the java.util.SecureRandom class to generate random bytes for the salt. However, the code does not specify a specific PRNG algorithm or provider, which means that the default PRNG algorithm and provider will be used. This may result in the use of a weak or predictable random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a specific PRNG algorithm and provider using the SecureRandom.getInstance() method. For example, use SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\") to use the SHA1PRNG algorithm."
