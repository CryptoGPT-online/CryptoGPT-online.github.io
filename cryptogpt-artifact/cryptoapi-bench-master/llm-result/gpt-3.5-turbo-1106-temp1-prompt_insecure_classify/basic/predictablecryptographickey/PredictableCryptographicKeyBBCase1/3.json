[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();",
"description": "The code is using the default key 'defaultkey' to generate the encryption key. The key is not randomly generated and has low entropy, which makes it susceptible to brute force attacks or key guessing attacks.",
"recommendation": "Generate a strong and random encryption key using a cryptographic random number generator, such as SecureRandom class."}]
