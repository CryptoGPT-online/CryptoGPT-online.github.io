    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded default key which is not recommended for encryption. Additionally, it uses AES encryption with a key of only 16 bytes, which is considered as insufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a secure random key using a cryptographically secure random number generator and use a longer key length for AES encryption, such as 256 bits."
