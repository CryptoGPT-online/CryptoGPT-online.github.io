[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);", 
  "description": "The SecureRandom instance 'sr' is being used to generate a salt for password-based encryption, but the use of SecureRandom may not provide a sufficient level of randomness for cryptographic operations.", 
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a more secure and cryptographically strong random number generator, such as java.security.SecureRandom, to generate the salt value."}, 
 {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010; int keyLength = 16;", 
  "description": "The iteration count and key length used for password-based encryption are not following best practices for encryption strength. The iteration count and key length should be chosen to provide an appropriate level of security against brute force attacks.", 
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a higher iteration count and a longer key length to increase the encryption strength."}]
