    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey,salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec with a default salt and iteration count, which may lead to weak key derivation. Additionally, the use of a single character default key is also a security risk.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random salt, increase the iteration count to a minimum of 100,000, and use a longer, more complex default key."
