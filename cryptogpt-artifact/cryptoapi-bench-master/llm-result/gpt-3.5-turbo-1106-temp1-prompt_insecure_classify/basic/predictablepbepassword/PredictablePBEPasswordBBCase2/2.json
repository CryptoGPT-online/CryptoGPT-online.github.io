[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
  "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate salt for password-based encryption, but the length of the salt is fixed at 16 bytes, which may not provide sufficient randomness for the cryptographic operation.",
  "recommendation": "Use a larger salt length, at least 128 bits (16 bytes), to improve the randomness of the salt and the security of the password-based encryption."}]
