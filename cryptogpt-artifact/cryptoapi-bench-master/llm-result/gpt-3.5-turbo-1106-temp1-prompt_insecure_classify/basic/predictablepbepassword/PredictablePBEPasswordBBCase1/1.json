    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\n        sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate cryptographically strong random numbers, but the usage here seems to be incorrect. The salt generation should not rely solely on the default constructor of SecureRandom, as it may not provide sufficient entropy for secure cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more specific algorithm such as SHA1PRNG for creating the SecureRandom instance, and specify the provider explicitly. For example, SecureRandom sr = SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\", \"SUN\"); sr.nextBytes(salt); or SecureRandom sr = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(); sr.nextBytes(salt);"
