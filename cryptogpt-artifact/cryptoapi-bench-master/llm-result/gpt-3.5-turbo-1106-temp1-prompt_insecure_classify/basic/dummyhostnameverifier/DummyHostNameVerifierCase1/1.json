{
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n    return true;\n}",
    "description": "The verify method of the D1 class implements the HostnameVerifier interface. However, it always returns true without performing any certificate validation. This can allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by presenting a forged certificate.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic in the verify method. Use the SSLSession to obtain the server certificate and verify it against trusted certificate authorities."
