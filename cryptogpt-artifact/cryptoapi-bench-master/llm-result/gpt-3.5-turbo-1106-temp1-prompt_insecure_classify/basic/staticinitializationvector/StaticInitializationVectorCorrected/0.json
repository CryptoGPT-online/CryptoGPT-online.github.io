[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "BigInteger i = BigInteger.valueOf(sr.nextInt());\nbyte [] bytes = i.toByteArray();", "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a random number and then converts it to a byte array, which is then used as an initialization vector (IV). However, using the `nextInt()` method of SecureRandom and converting it to a byte array may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "To generate a secure IV, use the `nextBytes()` method of SecureRandom to directly fill a byte array with random values."}]
