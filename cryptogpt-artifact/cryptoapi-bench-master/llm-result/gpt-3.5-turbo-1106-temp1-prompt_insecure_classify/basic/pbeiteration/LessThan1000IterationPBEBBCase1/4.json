    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);\nint count = 20;",
    "description": "The code uses a constant iteration count of 20, which is considered insufficient for modern security requirements. Additionally, the salt generation process using SecureRandom may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure and dynamic iteration count for key derivation, and consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator like SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() for salt generation."
