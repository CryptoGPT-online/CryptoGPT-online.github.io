    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not explicitly seeded with any random values, which may result in insufficiently random salt being generated. This could lead to weak cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Initialize the SecureRandom instance with a strong source of randomness, such as /dev/random or /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems or use java.security.SecureRandom.setSeed method with a truly random seed."
