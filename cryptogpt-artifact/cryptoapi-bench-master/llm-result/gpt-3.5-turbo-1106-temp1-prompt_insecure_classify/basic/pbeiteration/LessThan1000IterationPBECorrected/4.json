[{"misuse":"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values","vulnerable_code":"byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);","description":"The code uses a fixed-length salt of 32 bytes. However, a fixed-length salt can reduce the security of the cryptographic operation as it becomes more susceptible to precomputed rainbow table attacks. Additionally, the code uses SecureRandom to generate random numbers, which is good practice. However, the SecureRandom instance is not properly seeded with enough entropy, which can result in predictable or weak random numbers.","recommendation":"Generate a cryptographically secure random salt of sufficient length using a strong random number generator with adequate entropy. The length of the salt should typically be at least 128 bits (16 bytes). Ensure the random number generator is properly seeded with sufficient entropy."}]
