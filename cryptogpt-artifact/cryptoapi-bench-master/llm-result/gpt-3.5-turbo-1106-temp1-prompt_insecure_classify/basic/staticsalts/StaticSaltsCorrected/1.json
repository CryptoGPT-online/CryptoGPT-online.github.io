[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);","description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers and should be used to generate random salts. It is important to ensure that the salt used in cryptographic operations is sufficiently random to prevent predictable output. However, in this code, the salt is generated using the nextBytes() method without specifying a strong enough randomization algorithm. This may result in a weak or predictable salt.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure and randomization algorithm (such as using SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() instead of the default constructor) to generate the salt."}]
