[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The code is generating a salt value using SecureRandom, but the length of the salt is only 32 bytes. This may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic operations.", "recommendation": "Increase the length of the salt to ensure sufficient randomness. For example, a salt length of 128 bits (16 bytes) is commonly used."},
{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.", "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;", "description": "The code is using a value of 1020 for the iteration count in PBEParameterSpec. This value appears to be inadequate and may result in weak encryption. A higher iteration count should be used to increase encryption strength.", "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 10,000 or more, to improve encryption strength."}]
