  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
  "description": "The code uses the RC2 symmetric encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure for most applications. It is vulnerable to various attacks and should not be used.",
  "recommendation": "Replace the use of RC2 with a stronger symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES."
