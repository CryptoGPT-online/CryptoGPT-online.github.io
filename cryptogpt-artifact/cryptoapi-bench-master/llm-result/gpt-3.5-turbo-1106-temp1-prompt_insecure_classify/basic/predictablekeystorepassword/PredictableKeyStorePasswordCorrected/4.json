[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.", "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The use of random.ints() to generate a password does not provide sufficient entropy for a secure password. The random.ints() method generates a sequence of pseudo-random numbers, which may be predictable and easily guessable.", "recommendation": "Use a secure password generation method, such as SecureRandom or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG)."}]
