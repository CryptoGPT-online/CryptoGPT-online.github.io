[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
  "description": "The code is using the `SecureRandom` class to generate a password. However, it utilizes the `random.ints()` method to generate the password, which may not provide sufficient randomness for a secure password.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to generate a random password, such as `SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[] bytes)`, and ensure that the password length and complexity are appropriate for the application's security requirements."}]
