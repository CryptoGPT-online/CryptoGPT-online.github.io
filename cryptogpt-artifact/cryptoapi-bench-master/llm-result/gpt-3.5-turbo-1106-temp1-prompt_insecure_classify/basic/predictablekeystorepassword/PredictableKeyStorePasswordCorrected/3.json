[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "String type = \"JKS\";", "description": "The use of JKS (Java KeyStore) algorithm is considered outdated and can be susceptible to various cryptographic attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as PKCS12.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as PKCS12, instead of JKS."}, 
{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.", "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), password.toCharArray());", "description": "The code is loading the KeyStore from a remote URL (https://www. google.com) without performing proper certificate validation. This can make the code vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and allow an attacker to exchange the certificate with a malicious one.", "recommendation": "Perform proper certificate validation when loading the KeyStore. Use a trust store with trusted certificates to validate the remote URL's certificate, or implement custom certificate validation logic to ensure the authenticity of the certificate."}, 
{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The code is generating a secure random password using random.ints(), which may not produce a sufficiently random value. Weak random values can be subject to brute-force attacks or make cryptographic algorithms vulnerable.", "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure method to generate random values, such as using SecureRandom class with a cryptographic random number generator algorithm like SHA1PRNG."},

Weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked, compromising the security of the cryptographic operations.", "recommendation": "Use a stronger, longer, and more complex password for the KeyStore, preferably with a minimum length of 12 characters and a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols."}]
