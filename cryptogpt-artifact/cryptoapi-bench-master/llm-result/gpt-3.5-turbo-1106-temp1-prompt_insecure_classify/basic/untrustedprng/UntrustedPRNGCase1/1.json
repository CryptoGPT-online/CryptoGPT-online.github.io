    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();\nint x = randomGenerator.nextInt();",
    "description": "The code uses the Random class without specifying a seed value. This can lead to the generation of predictable or easily guessable random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, which uses a cryptographic algorithm for generating random numbers. Additionally, consider specifying a seed value for the random number generator to increase randomness."
