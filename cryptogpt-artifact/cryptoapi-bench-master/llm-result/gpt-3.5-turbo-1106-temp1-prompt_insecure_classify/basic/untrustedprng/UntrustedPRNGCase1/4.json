[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
"vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();\nint x = randomGenerator.nextInt();", 
"description": "The code is using the java.util.Random class to generate a random number. However, the java.util.Random class is a pseudorandom number generator which uses a seed value. If the seed value is predictable or not properly seeded, the generated random number can be easily guessed or reproduced.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographic-strength random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate random numbers. SecureRandom provides more randomness and is suitable for cryptographic operations."}]
