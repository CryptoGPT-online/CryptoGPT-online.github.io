[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
  "description": "The AES key is being generated with the default key size, which could result in inadequate encryption strength.",
  "recommendation": "Specify a key size when generating the AES key, for example by using `keyGen.init(256)` to generate a 256-bit key."}, 
 {"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
  "description": "The code is explicitly selecting the CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which may not be the most secure option.",
  "recommendation": "Prefer using GCM mode with authenticated encryption (AEAD) over CBC mode with PKCS5 padding for better security and integrity protection."}]
