[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values","vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());","description": "The password is generated using the random.ints() method, which may not provide a cryptographically secure random value for creating a secure password. It should use a more secure and recommended method for generating strong passwords.","recommendation": "Use a secure method like SecureRandom and a library like Apache Commons Text to generate a secure random password."},{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength","vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;","description": "The key length of 16 bits may not provide sufficient encryption strength for the PBEKeySpec. A stronger key length should be used to ensure the encryption strength.","recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 128 bits for stronger encryption."}]
