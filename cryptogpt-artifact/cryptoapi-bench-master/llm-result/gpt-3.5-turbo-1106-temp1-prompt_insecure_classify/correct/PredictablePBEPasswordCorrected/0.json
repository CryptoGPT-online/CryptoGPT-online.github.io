[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The code uses random.ints() to generate a password, which may not provide a cryptographically strong random value for use as a password. This can lead to weak security for the encryption key.", "recommendation": "Use a dedicated cryptographic random number generator such as SecureRandom to generate the password for key generation."},{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010; int keyLength = 16;", "description": "The iterationCount is set to a relatively low value and the keyLength is also relatively small, which may result in weaker encryption strength.", "recommendation": "Increase the iterationCount and keyLength to enhance encryption strength."}]
