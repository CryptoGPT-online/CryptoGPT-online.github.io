[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nint x = random.nextInt();", "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a single random integer, but the use of nextInt() does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to generate random numbers for cryptographic purposes, such as SecureRandom's nextBytes() method to generate random bytes, and then convert them to an integer if needed."}]
