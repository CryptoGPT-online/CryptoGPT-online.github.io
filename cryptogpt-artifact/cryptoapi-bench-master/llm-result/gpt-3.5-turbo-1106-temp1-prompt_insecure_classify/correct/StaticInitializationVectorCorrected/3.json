[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "BigInteger i = BigInteger.valueOf(sr.nextInt());\nbyte [] bytes = i.toByteArray();\nIvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);", "description": "The code uses the SecureRandom class to generate an IV for AES encryption, but it uses the nextInt() method, which may not provide a cryptographically secure random number. Converting the integer to a byte array using BigInteger and using it as the IV may result in insufficiently random IVs, which can weaken the encryption.", "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom's nextBytes() method to generate a random byte array for the IV, which ensures a cryptographically secure random value is used for encryption."}]
