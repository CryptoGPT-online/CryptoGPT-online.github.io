[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
  "description": "The code uses the default hostname verifier to validate the SSL certificate for all hostnames other than '192.168.0.10', which can lead to improper certificate validation and potential security vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Explicitly define the hostname verifier logic instead of relying on the default hostname verifier. Perform proper hostname verification by checking the hostname against the SSL certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) and Common Name (CN) fields."}]
