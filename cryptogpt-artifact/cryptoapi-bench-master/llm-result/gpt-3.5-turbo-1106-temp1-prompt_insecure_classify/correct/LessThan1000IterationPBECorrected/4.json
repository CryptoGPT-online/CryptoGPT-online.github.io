[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a salt for password-based encryption, but the length of the salt is too short (32 bytes) for modern security requirements. Also, the iteration count of 1020 is relatively low for password-based encryption.", "recommendation": "Generate a longer and more random salt using SecureRandom, and use a higher iteration count for stronger security."}]
