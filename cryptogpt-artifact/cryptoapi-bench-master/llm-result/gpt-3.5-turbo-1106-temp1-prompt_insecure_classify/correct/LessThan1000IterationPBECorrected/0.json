[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", 
  "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not seeded with enough entropy which can lead to insufficiently random values for the salt. The salt generated may not be unpredictable and could weaken the security of the key derivation process.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure source of randomness, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), to generate the salt."}]
