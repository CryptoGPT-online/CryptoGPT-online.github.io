[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", 
  "description": "The use of SecureRandom to generate a salt for password-based encryption (PBE) is not inherently wrong, but the chosen salt length of 32 bytes might be excessive and inefficient. Additionally, the count of 1020 for key derivation is arbitrary and may not provide sufficient randomness.", 
  "recommendation": "It's recommended to use a standard salt length of 8-16 bytes and a well-defined iteration count such as 10,000 or higher. Consult relevant cryptographic guidelines or standards for appropriate values."}]
