[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "long l = sr.nextLong();\nsr.setSeed(l);", "description": "The code uses a single long value obtained from SecureRandom to seed the same SecureRandom instance that generated it. This can lead to insufficiently random values and weaken the security of cryptographic operations.", "recommendation": "Instead of using setSeed(), directly use SecureRandom for generating random numbers without setting the seed."}]
