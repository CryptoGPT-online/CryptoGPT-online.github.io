[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l);", "description": "Setting the seed of a SecureRandom instance with a single long value does not provide sufficient entropy for secure random number generation.", "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without explicitly setting the seed, as it automatically seeds itself using a cryptographically strong random value from the operating system."}]
