[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "long l = sr.nextLong(); sr.setSeed(l); int v = sr.nextInt();", 
  "description": "Setting the seed of the SecureRandom instance to a single long value retrieved from nextLong() does not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations. It reduces the randomness of the generated values.", 
  "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without manually setting the seed. SecureRandom is designed to provide a cryptographically strong random number generator, so manual seeding is unnecessary and can reduce security. Consider using SecureRandom directly for generating random numbers."}]
