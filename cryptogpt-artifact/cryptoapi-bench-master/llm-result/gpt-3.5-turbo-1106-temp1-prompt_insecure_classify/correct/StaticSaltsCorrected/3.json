[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The SecureRandom instance is used without explicitly specifying a cryptographic PRNG algorithm and seed. Using the default constructor for SecureRandom may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic operations, and the use of a fixed seed or weak algorithm may lead to predictable values.", "recommendation": "Use a specific cryptographic PRNG algorithm (e.g., SHA1PRNG) and provide a seed value to the SecureRandom instance, or consider using a stronger source of randomness such as java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() for generating secure random values."}]
