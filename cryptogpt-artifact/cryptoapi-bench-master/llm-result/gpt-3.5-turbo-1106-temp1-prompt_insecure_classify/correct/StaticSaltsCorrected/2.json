[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The use of SecureRandom with a single instance and no seed can lead to insufficiently random values being generated, which can weaken the security of cryptographic operations.", "recommendation": "Initialize the SecureRandom instance with an entropy source or use a cryptographically secure random number generator like java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."}]
