        "description": "Manually seeding 'SecureRandom' with a predictable or static seed weakens the randomness of the generated values. It may not provide a sufficiently random value as expected from a cryptographic security perspective, particularly if the seed is known or can be guessed by an attacker.",
        "recommendation": "Do not manually seed 'SecureRandom' unless you have a very specific need to reproduce a sequence of random numbers, such as in a test environment. In security-sensitive applications, allow 'SecureRandom' to self-seed with default entropy sources provided by the underlying platform."
