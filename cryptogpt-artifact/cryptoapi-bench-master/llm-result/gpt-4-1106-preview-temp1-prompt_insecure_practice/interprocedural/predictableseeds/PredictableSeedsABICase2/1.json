    "description": "The seed is constructed from a single static byte, which does not provide sufficient entropy. As a result, the randomness provided by SecureRandom would be predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using hard-coded seeds. Rather, allow SecureRandom to self-seed or use SecureRandom.generateSeed(int) to generate a proper seed with sufficient entropy."
