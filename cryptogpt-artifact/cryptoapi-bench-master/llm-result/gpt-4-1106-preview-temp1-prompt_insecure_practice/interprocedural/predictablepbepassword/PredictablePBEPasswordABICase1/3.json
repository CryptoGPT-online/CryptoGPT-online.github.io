    "description": "The keyLength argument specified for PBEKeySpec is 16, which equals 128 bits. This may not provide sufficient security, especially for high-security applications, as 128-bit keys are considered to be the minimum acceptable key size.",
    "recommendation": "Use a larger key size. A size of at least 256 bits is recommended for higher security."

    "misuse": "Weak Password-Based Encryption (PBE)",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code snippet possibly uses a weak PBE algorithm, as the PBEKeySpec does not specify the algorithm and the use of passwords for key derivation is generally less secure compared to other entropy sources.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure the use of a strong PBE algorithm like 'PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256'. Also, consider using stronger entropy sources for key material."

  {
    "misuse": "Insufficient Iteration Count",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The iteration count (rounds of hashing) is set to 11010 which might be insufficient for mitigating brute-force attacks, depending on the context and the algorithm used.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 100,000 rounds, as recommended by NIST guidelines, or even more based on the performance-security trade-off."
