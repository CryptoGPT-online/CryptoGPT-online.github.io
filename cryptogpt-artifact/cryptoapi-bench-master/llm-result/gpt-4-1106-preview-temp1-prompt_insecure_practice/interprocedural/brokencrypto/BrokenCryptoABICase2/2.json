  "description": "When using block cipher modes such as CBC that require an initialization vector (IV), not providing a randomly generated IV for each encryption can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Ensure that an IV is provided and is generated using a secure random source when using CBC mode. The IV must also be transmitted along with the ciphertext securely."

  "description": "The key generator does not specify a secure randomness source or key size, which may lead to weak and potentially predictable keys.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure randomness source and define an appropriate key size when generating keys. For Blowfish, ensure the key size is acceptable, and for AES, use 128, 192, or 256 bits."
