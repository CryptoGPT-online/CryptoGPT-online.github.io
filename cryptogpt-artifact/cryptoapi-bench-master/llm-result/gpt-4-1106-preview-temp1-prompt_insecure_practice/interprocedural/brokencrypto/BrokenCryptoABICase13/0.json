  "description": "RC4 is a broken and deprecated stream cipher that is known to have several vulnerabilities and should not be used in any secure context. It is susceptible to various attacks, including biases in the byte output that can leak information about the plaintext.",
  "recommendation": "Replace RC4 with a secure algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a secure mode of operation, for example, AES/GCM or AES/CBC with a proper padding scheme."
},{
  "misuse": "Missing Initialization Vector (IV)",
  "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
  "description": "When using block ciphers in modes like CBC, it is essential to use a unique and unpredictable Initialization Vector (IV) for each encryption to provide semantic security. However, if the cipher algorithm was a block cipher and used in a mode like CBC, this code would not include the use of an IV, which could lead to vulnerabilities like predictable IVs.",
  "recommendation": "Ensure that an IV is used when required by the cipher algorithm and mode. When CBC mode is used, generate a random IV for each encryption and provide it to the Cipher.init method using an IvParameterSpec."
