        "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode of operation for block ciphers is not recommended as it does not provide serious message confidentiality. Identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks, making it susceptible to pattern attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with a unique IV for each encryption operation."
