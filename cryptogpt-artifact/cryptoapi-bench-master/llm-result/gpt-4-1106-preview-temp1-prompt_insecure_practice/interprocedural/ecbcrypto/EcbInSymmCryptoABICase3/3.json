    "description": "The use of ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode for encryption is insecure because it does not provide serious message confidentiality, which may lead to data leakage through pattern preservation when encrypting identical plaintext blocks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation (e.g., CBC, CTR, GCM) with a strong random IV for each encryption."
