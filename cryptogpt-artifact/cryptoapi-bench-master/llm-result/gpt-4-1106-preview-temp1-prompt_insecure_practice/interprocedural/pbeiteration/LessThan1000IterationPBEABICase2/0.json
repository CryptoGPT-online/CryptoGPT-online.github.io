        "description": "While `SecureRandom` is used to generate the salt, which is secure, the initialization and conversion process of the iteration count from `String` to `char[]` and then back to `String` could possibly lead to an incorrect interpretation of the character values as digits, potentially leading to a weak iteration count when parsed. Moreover, public exposure of defaults and direct manipulation allow for potential tampering.",
