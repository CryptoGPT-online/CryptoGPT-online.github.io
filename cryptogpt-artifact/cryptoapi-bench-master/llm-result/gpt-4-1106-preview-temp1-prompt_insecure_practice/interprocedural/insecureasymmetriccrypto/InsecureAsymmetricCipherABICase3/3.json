    "description": "The code uses RSA encryption and decryption without specifying the padding scheme. Using RSA without padding (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding or RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding) can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a secure padding mechanism when getting a Cipher instance, such as 'RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding'."

    "misuse": "Inappropriate RSA Key Size",
    "vulnerable_code": "int key = 1024;",
    "description": "The RSA key size of 1024 bits is no longer considered secure. It is now recommended to use a key size of at least 2048 bits to ensure security against modern attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the RSA key size to at least 2048 bits."

    "misuse": "Static IV/Seed",
    "vulnerable_code": "method1(int key)",
    "description": "While the method1 does not directly use an IV, using RSA with block cipher modes without an IV can be insecure if the scenario where it's used requires one. It's not explicitly done here, but would be relevant if the use case involved repetitive encryption which is not clearly defined in the provided code.",
    "recommendation": "This is not directly applicable here, because RSA is used without modes like ECB or CBC that would require an IV. This potential misuse is mentioned for completeness, in case later modifications of the code introduce block ciphers without a secure IV handling."

  {
    "misuse": "String Initialization",
    "vulnerable_code": "new String(\"Secret Message\")",
    "description": "Using String to store sensitive information, such as a secret message, can lead to security risks since Strings are immutable and stored in the string pool, potentially exposing the sensitive information to a longer lifetime in memory than necessary.",
    "recommendation": "Use char arrays to handle sensitive information and cleanse them from memory when done (e.g., Arrays.fill(passwordCharArray, '0');). This is recommended despite not being a direct cryptographic API misuse, as it's related to secure handling of sensitive data."
