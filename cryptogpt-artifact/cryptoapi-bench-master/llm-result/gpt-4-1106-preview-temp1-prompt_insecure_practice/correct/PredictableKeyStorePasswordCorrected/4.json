    "description": "The code is catching generic exceptions which may neglect security-related exceptions, potentially hiding underlying security flaws.",
    "recommendation": "Catch specific exceptions that could affect security, such as NoSuchAlgorithmException, KeyStoreException, and handle them appropriately."

    "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "description": "The code retrieves a KeyStore over an untrusted connection. Despite the fact that the URL starts with 'https', it's not a guarantee that the connection is secure because it's a hardcoded, non-trustworthy source.",
    "recommendation": "Use a trusted and verifiable certificate source. Validate the server's certificate chain and hostname."
