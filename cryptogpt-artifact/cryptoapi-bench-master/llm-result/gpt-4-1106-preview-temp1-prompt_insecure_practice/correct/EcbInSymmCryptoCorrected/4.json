    "description": "The code suggests the class name 'EcbInSymmCryptoBBCase1' might imply the use of ECB mode, but the class 'Ed' is actually being implemented using CBC mode. This is confusing and potentially misleading if 'EcbInSymmCryptoBBCase1' class has ECB related vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Refactor 'EcbInSymmCryptoBBCase1' to 'CbcInSymmCryptoBBCase1' if it is indeed using CBC mode, or change the code to actually use ECB mode if that's the intent, noting that ECB mode is not recommended due to its insecurity."
