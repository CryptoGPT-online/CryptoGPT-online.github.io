        "description": "Using 'SecureRandom.setSeed()' method with a value that has just been generated by calling 'nextLong()' can lead to a predictable seed and hence predictable random values which is not secure for cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid seeding 'SecureRandom' with values that may be predictable. When an instance of 'SecureRandom' is created, it is self-seeded with entropy from the system which should be secure enough for most purposes. If reseeding is necessary, use secure and unpredictable seed sources."
