    "description": "Using SecureRandom to generate a default key for a keystore without specifying the length can result in weak keys due to insufficient entropy. Furthermore, the method 'ints()' generates an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom int values that would need to be limited to generate a proper key length.",
