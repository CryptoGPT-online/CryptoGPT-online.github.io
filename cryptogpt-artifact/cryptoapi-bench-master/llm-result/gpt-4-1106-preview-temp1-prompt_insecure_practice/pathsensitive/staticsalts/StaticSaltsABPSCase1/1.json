        "description": "The salt for PBEParameterSpec is not sufficiently randomized, which reduces the strength of the encryption. The salt array is initialized to a single byte, and if 'choice' is greater than 1, SecureRandom is used on this too small byte array, which does not provide adequate entropy.",
        "recommendation": "Use a larger and properly randomized salt. Typically, a salt should be at least 128 bits (16 bytes)."

        "description": "The iteration count (1020) used for PBEParameterSpec is not sufficiently large. A low iteration count makes the key derivation process faster and less secure, which can be exploited by attackers using brute force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value that provides a better trade-off between security and performance, such as 10,000 or higher."
