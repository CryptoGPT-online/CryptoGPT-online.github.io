        "description": "Printing raw bytes of a cryptographic operation result (like a hash) directly to the console can lead to representation problems, where the console might interpret some byte values as control characters. Additionally, this is a bad practice from a security point of view, as it could leak sensitive data in logs or terminal history.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of directly printing the raw hash bytes, consider converting them to a hex or base64 encoded string that safely represents the binary data. For example, use `java.util.Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(md.digest())` for base64 or convert to hex representation using bitwise operations or an existing library."
