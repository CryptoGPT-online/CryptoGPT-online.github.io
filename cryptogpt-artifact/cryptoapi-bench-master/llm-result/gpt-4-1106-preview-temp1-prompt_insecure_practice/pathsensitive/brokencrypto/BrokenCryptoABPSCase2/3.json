Modern applications typically use algorithms with larger block sizes (like AES with 128-bit blocks) to withstand birthday attacks and meet current security standards.",
        "recommendation": "Switch to using a more secure and recommended cipher algorithm such as AES with a proper mode like GCM to benefit from authenticated encryption."
