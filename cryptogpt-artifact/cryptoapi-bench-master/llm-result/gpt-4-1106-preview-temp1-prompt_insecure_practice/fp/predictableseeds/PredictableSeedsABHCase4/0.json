        "description": "The code is misusing the SecureRandom constructor by providing it with a predictable seed. The 'SecureRandom' instance should not be seeded with predictable bytes when used for cryptographic purposes as it can result in a predictable random number sequence. This can be exploited to predict future values generated by the 'SecureRandom' instance, compromising its effectiveness for cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Do not seed 'SecureRandom' with a predictable value; instead, let the constructor generate its own, highly unpredictable seed automatically. Remove the parameter from 'new SecureRandom(new byte[]{b})' and use 'new SecureRandom()' instead."

        "vulnerable_code": "hm.put(\"ccc\", new Byte((byte) 300));\nhm.put(\"ddd\", new Byte((byte) 400));",
        "description": "The values 300 and 400 are being cast to a byte, which can only represent values from -128 to 127. As a result, there will be an overflow and the values stored in the map for 'ccc' and 'ddd' will not be the intended ones. While this may not directly relate to a security vulnerability, it demonstrates a lack of understanding of data types, which can lead to unpredictable behavior in security-sensitive contexts.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the numerical values you're working with are correctly represented within the bounds of the chosen data type. If you need to store larger values reliably, consider using a larger numeric data type such as 'int' or 'long'."
