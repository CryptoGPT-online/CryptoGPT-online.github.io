        "description": "Here, a seed is derived from a random integer converted to a string and then retrieved as bytes. The 'ints()' method returns an IntStream, which does not have a meaningful string representation. So, when calling 'String.valueOf' on it, we get a string describing the type and not the values. The bytes from such a string representation are not suitable for cryptographic operations and may lead to weak or predictable keys.",

Since the 'aaa' mapping stores a Byte object, autounboxing could throw a NullPointerException if 'aaa' were not present in the map.",

When casting the integers 300 and 400 to a byte, it results in integer overflow and stores an unintended value, which could lead to incorrect functioning of the application.",
