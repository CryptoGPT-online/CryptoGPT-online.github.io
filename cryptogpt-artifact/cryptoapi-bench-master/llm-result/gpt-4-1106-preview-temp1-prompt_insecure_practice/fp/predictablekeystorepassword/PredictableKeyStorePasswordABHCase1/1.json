    "description": "Using SecureRandom to generate a predictable keystore password can lead to easy brute-forcing because SecureRandom is not designed to generate secure passwords but rather secure random numbers. Additionally, the code turns a stream of ints into a string, which may not be random enough and can reduce the complexity.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure method to generate passwords such as a dedicated password generator API that ensures sufficient complexity and unpredictability."
