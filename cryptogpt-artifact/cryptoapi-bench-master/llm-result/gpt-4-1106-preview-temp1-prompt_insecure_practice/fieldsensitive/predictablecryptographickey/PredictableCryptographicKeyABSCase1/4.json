    "description": "Using a hardcoded 'defaultkey' as a fallback encryption key is insecure because it is readable in the source code and can be extracted easily by an attacker, making the encryption trivial to bypass.",

    "vulnerable_code": "String algoSpec = \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\";",
    "description": "The AES mode 'CBC' requires an initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation to ensure security. Without a unique and unpredictable IV, encryption with the same key and plaintext will result in the same ciphertext, making the system susceptible to attacks like pattern analysis.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a new random IV for each encryption operation, and safely transmit it alongside the ciphertext."

    "description": "The way the encryption key is derived from the given string is insecure. The key is simply obtained by getting the byte array representation of the string, and truncated or null-padded to fit the required key length, which does not provide enough entropy and could lead to weak keys.",
