    "description": "The class C1 defines a PBEParameterSpec, indicating the intent to use password-based encryption. However, there is no actual password-based key derivation function (such as using PBKDF2) to generate a SecretKey from a password, nor is there any evidence of encryption or decryption operations using the PBEParameterSpec.",
    "recommendation": "Implement password-based key derivation using a secure KDF such as PBKDF2 with a strong algorithm (e.g., PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256), and use the derived key along with the PBEParameterSpec to encrypt or decrypt data."
