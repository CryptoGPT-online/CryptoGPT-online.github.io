    "description": "The code disables hostname verification if the server's hostname is '192.168.0.10'. This means that the identity of the server with IP '192.168.0.10' is not verified, thereby accepting any SSL certificate presented by a server at that address, which can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the hard-coded IP address check that disables hostname verification. Always verify the server's hostname against the certificate presented to prevent MITM attacks."
