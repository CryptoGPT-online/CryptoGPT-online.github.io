As a result, it would accept any certificate presented by the server, even if it is invalid or not matching the hostname, which makes it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement a proper hostname verification mechanism that checks the server's certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Names (SANs) against the actual hostname being connected to. Consider using the default HostnameVerifier provided by the SSL context for secure hostname verification."
