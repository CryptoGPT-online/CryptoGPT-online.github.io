        "description": "By returning true in the verify method of a custom HostnameVerifier, the code is disabling hostname verification, which is a critical part of SSL/TLS security. This can allow man-in-the-middle attacks by accepting any hostname, even if it doesn't match the certificate presented by the server.",
        "recommendation": "Do not implement a custom HostnameVerifier that blindly accepts all hostnames. Instead, rely on the default hostname verification or implement proper hostname verification logic."
