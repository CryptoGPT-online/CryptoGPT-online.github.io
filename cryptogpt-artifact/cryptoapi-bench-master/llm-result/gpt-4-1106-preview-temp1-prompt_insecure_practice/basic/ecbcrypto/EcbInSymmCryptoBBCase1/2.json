        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
        "description": "The use of ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode for AES encryption is insecure because it does not provide serious message confidentiality. It encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks, making it vulnerable to replay attacks and pattern leakage, especially for data with regular patterns.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) with a unique, unpredictable initialization vector (IV) for each encryption, or an authenticated encryption mode like GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) that also provides data integrity."
