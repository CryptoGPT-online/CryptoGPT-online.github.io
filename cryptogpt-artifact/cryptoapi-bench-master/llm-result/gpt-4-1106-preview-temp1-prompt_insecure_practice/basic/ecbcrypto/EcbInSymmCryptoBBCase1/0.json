  "misuse": "Insecure Cryptographic Mode",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
  "description": "The code is using AES with ECB mode, which is insecure because identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to identical ciphertext blocks, leading to patterns being discernible in ciphertext.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM which uses an IV/nonce to ensure that identical plaintext blocks encrypt differently."
