    "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered to be a weak encryption algorithm due to its small key size of 56 bits, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a minimum key size of 128 bits."

    "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode is an insecure block cipher mode of operation because it does not provide serious message confidentiality. The same plaintext block will result in the same ciphertext block, making patterns visible in the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) with an IV (Initialization Vector), or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) that provides both confidentiality and integrity."
