    "description": "The DES encryption algorithm is considered to be cryptographically broken and is unsuitable for modern security-related tasks.",

    "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) is an insecure block cipher mode to operate symmetric key encryption algorithms because it does not provide serious message confidentiality. It encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks, hence it does not hide data patterns well.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) that provide better data confidentiality."
