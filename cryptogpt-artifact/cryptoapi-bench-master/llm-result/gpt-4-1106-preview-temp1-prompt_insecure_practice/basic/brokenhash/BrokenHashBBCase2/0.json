        "description": "MD5 is a weak hash function that is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means it's possible to generate two different inputs that result in the same hash value. This makes it unsuitable for any security-sensitive applications.",

        "description": "Directly printing the result of 'md.digest()' will lead to an unreadable output, as it returns a byte array that may contain non-printable characters. This might not be a security issue per se, but it relates to incorrect handling of binary data, which in different contexts can lead to security problems.",
        "recommendation": "Encode the byte array to a readable format such as hexadecimal or Base64 before printing."
