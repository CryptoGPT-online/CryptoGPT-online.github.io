    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 256 bits, by passing the appropriate parameter to the `KeyGenerator.getInstance()` method, e.g., `KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES/256\")`"

    "description": "The code is using the CBC mode of operation with PKCS5 padding, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Padding oracle attacks can allow an attacker to decrypt ciphertext without knowing the encryption key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as GCM, instead of CBC. For example, `Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\")`."
