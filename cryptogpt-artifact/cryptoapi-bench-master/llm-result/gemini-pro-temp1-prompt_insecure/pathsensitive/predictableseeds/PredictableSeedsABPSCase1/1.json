    "description": "The SecureRandom object is seeded with a small number of bytes, which may not be sufficient to generate cryptographically secure random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`, and seed it with a strong source of entropy, such as `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."
