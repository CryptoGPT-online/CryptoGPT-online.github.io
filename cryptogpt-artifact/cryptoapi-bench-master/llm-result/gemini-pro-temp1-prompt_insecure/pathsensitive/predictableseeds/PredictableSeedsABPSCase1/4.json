    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "Using the output of a SecureRandom object as the seed for the same SecureRandom object is not secure. It makes the SecureRandom object predictable, which can lead to attacks on cryptographic algorithms that rely on randomness.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, and seed it with a truly random seed, such as the output of /dev/urandom or a hardware random number generator."
