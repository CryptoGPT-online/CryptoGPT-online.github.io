    "description": "The salt is created using a fixed size array, which is not secure. Salts should be generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to create the salt, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and use a salt size of at least 128 bits."
