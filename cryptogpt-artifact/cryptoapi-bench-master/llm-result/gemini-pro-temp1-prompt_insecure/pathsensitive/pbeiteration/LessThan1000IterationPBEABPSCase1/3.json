    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "Using a weak cryptographic algorithm can make it easier for an attacker to decrypt encrypted data. In this case, the PBEParameterSpec is being used with a low iteration count (1050), which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-256, with a higher iteration count (at least 100,000)."
