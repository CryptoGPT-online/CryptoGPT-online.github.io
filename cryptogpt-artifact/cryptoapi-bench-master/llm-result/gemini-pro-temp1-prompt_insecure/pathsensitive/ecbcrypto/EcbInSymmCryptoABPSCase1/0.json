    "description": "The code is using the default key size for AES, which is 128 bits. This is considered to be inadequate for many applications, as it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 256 bits, by specifying it in the `KeyGenerator.init()` method."

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Weak Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code is using the ECB (Electronic Codebook) block cipher mode, which is considered to be insecure. ECB mode is deterministic, meaning that identical blocks of plaintext will always produce identical blocks of ciphertext. This makes it vulnerable to attacks such as the ECB cut-and-paste attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter) mode."
