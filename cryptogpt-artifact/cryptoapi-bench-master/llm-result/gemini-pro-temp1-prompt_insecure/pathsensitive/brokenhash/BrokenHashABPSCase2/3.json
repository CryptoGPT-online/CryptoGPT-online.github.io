    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is no longer considered secure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that two different inputs can produce the same hash output. This can be exploited to create fraudulent messages or digital signatures that appear to be authentic.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD5."
