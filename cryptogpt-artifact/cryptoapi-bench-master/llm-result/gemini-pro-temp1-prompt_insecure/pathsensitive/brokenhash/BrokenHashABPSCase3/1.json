    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and no longer secure. Attackers can find collisions and preimages for MD4, making it unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
