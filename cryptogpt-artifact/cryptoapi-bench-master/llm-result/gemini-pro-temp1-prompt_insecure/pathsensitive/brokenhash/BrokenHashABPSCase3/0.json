    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "MD4 is a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for security purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD4 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
