    "description": "MD2 is a weak cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered secure. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD2 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
