    "misuse": "CWE-328: Use of Key Derivation Function (KDF) with Insufficient Iteration Count",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The provided code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a key for AES encryption, but it does not specify the number of iterations for the key derivation function (KDF). By default, `SecureRandom` may not perform enough iterations, making the generated key vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, use a strong KDF such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt and specify a high number of iterations (e.g., 100,000 or more) to generate the encryption key."
