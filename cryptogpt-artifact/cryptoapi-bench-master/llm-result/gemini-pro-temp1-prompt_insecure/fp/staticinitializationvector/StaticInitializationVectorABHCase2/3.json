    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = str.getBytes();",
    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded value (`str.getBytes()`) as the initialization vector (IV) for the cipher. This is a security risk because an attacker could potentially guess or brute-force the IV, allowing them to decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for each encryption operation using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG)."
