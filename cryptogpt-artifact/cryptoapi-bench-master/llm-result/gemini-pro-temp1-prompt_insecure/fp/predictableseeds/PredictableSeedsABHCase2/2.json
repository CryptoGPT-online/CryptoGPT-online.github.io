    "description": "The `seed` used to initialize the `SecureRandom` object is based on a single byte value obtained from the HashMap, which is not sufficient to provide adequate entropy for random number generation.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure entropy source, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, or a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) like `java.security.interfaces.RSAKey`, to generate random numbers."
