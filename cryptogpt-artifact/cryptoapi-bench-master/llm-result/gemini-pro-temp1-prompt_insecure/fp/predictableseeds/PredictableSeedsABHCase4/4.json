    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Seeding of Random Number Generator",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{b});",
    "description": "The provided seed is not sufficient to securely initialize the SecureRandom object. Using a single byte as a seed is not cryptographically secure and can result in predictable output from the random number generator.",
    "suggestion": "Use a strong seed value to initialize the SecureRandom object. This can be achieved by using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the seed or by using a combination of multiple sources of randomness, such as system time, hardware entropy, and user input."
