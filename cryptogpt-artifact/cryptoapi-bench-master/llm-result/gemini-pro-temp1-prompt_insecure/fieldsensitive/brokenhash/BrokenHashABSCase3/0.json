    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm for hashing, which is considered insecure and should not be used. MD4 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
