    "description": "The code generates a key using the default key generator, which may not be appropriate for the chosen cipher. Additionally, the key is generated without specifying any key size, which may result in a weak key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong key generator, such as `SecureRandom`, and specify an appropriate key size."
