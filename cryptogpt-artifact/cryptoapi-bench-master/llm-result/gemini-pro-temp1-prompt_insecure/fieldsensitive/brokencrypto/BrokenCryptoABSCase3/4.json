    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The key for encryption is generated using the `KeyGenerator` with the default algorithm, which is `RC4` in this case. Hard-coding the key weakens the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of hard-coding the key, consider using a secure key generation mechanism, such as generating a random key or deriving a key from a passphrase."

    "description": "The `RC4` algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for encryption. It is vulnerable to various attacks, including keystream recovery attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20."
