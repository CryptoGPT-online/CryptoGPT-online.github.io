    "description": "The algorithm used for encryption is based on the value of passedAlgo, which is empty and allows the default value of defaultAlgo to be used instead. This can potentially lead to security risks because the encryption is not consistently applied, making it easier for attackers to decipher the encrypted data.",

    "recommendation": "Ensure that the default algorithm and the key used for encryption are generated and stored in a secure manner."
