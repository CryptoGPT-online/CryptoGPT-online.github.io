    "description": "Hard-coding cryptographic keys in the code makes them easily accessible to attackers. Once an attacker obtains the key, they can decrypt or forge messages.",

    "description": "DES is an outdated and insecure encryption algorithm that is no longer considered secure. ECB mode is also insecure as it does not provide confidentiality.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES or ChaCha20. Use a block cipher mode that provides confidentiality and integrity, such as CBC, CFB, or GCM."

    "description": "Passing an empty string as the encryption algorithm allows the default algorithm to be used, which is DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding. This algorithm is both insecure and outdated.",
    "recommendation": "Always explicitly specify the encryption algorithm to use, and ensure that it is a secure and up-to-date algorithm."
