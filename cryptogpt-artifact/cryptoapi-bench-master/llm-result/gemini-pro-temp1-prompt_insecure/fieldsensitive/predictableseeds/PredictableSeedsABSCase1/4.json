    "description": "The code uses a weak random seed, which is the same for all instances of the `C1` class. This makes it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random seed, such as a cryptographically secure random number generator or a seed generated from a secure source."
