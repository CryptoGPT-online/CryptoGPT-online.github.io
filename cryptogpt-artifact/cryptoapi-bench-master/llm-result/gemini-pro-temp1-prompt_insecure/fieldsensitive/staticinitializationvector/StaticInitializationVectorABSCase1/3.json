    "description": "The code is using AES without specifying the key size. By default, AES is initialized with a key size of 128 bits. This is considered insecure as it is susceptible to brute-force attacks. It is recommended to use a key size of at least 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and secure cryptographic algorithm with a key size of at least 256 bits, such as AES-256 or AES-GCM."
