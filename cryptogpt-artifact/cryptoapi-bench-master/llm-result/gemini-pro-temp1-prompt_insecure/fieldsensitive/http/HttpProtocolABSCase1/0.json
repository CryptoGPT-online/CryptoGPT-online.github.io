    "description": "The code checks if `passedURL` is empty and if so, assigns it the value of `defURL`. However, there is no check to ensure that `defURL` is not empty before using it, which could lead to an array index out of bounds exception.",

    "vulnerable_code": "defURL = url;",
    "description": "The code assigns the value of the `url` variable to the `defURL` field without any validation or sanitization. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL that would be used by the `C1` class.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure method of storing and retrieving the default URL, such as storing it in a configuration file or using a secret manager."
