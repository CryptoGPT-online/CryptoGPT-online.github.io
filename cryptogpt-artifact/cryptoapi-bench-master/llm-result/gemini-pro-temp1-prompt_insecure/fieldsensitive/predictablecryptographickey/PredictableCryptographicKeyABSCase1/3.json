    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The key is converted to bytes using the UTF-8 character set, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic purposes. Additionally, the key is truncated to 16 bytes, which further reduces its strength.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator to generate a key of appropriate length for the chosen encryption algorithm. Consider using a key derivation function to derive a cryptographic key from a password or passphrase."

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "String algoSpec = \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\";\nString algo = \"AES\";",
    "description": "The code uses the AES algorithm in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Additionally, the AES key size is not specified, which could allow an attacker to use a weak key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode such as GCM or EAX instead of CBC. Use an appropriate key size for the chosen algorithm. Consider using a library that provides secure defaults for these parameters."
