    "description": "The code uses `hostName` as input to create an SSL socket without properly validating it. This can allow an attacker to spoof the hostname and intercept sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Validate the hostname before using it to create the SSL socket. This can be done by checking it against a trusted list of hostnames or by using a certificate pinning mechanism."
