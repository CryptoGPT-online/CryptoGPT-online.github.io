    "misuse": "CWE-256: Unprotected Transport of Sensitive Data",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostname,soc);",
    "description": "The code uses the default SSL socket factory to create a socket for communication. However, it does not specify any security parameters, such as the protocol or cipher suite to be used. This can lead to the use of insecure protocols or ci نع̂̂pher suites, which could allow an attacker to intercept and decrypt the transmitted data.",
    "suggestions": "To fix this issue, the code should explicitly specify the security parameters to be used when creating the socket. For example, the code could use the following code to create a socket that uses the TLSv1.2 protocol and the AES-256 cipher suite:\n\n```java\nSSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();\nSSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostname,soc);\nsocket.setEnabledProtocols(new String[] { \"TLSv1.2\" });\nsocket.setEnabledCipherSuites(new String[] { \"AES-256\" });\n```"
