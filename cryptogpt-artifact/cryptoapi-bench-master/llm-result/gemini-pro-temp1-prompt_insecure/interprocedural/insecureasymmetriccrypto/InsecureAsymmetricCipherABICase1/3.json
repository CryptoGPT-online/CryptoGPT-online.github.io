Sure, here is the security audit result:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");\nkgp.initialize(keySize);",
    "description": "The key size of 1024 bits is considered inadequate for RSA encryption. Current recommendations suggest using a key size of at least 2048 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to at least 2048 bits to ensure adequate encryption strength."
  }
]
```

**CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**

* **Description:** Using an encryption algorithm with a key size that is too small can allow an attacker to break the encryption and access the protected data.
* **Recommendation:** Increase the key size to at least 2048 bits to ensure adequate encryption strength.

In this case, the code is using a key size of 1024 bits for RSA encryption. This is considered inadequate by current security standards. It is recommended to increase the key size to at least 2048 bits to ensure adequate encryption strength.
