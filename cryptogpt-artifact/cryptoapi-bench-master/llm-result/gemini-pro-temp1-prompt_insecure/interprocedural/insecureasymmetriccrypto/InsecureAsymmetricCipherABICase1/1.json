    "description": "The key size used for RSA encryption is only 1024 bits, which is considered weak and can be easily broken using modern computing power.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to at least 2048 bits or higher to provide a more secure level of encryption."

    "description": "The RSA public key is being used to encrypt data, which means that anyone with access to the public key can decrypt the data. This is not a secure way to store sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, which uses a secret key that is not publicly known."
