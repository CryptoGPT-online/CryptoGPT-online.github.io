Sure. Here are the potential crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");\nkgp.initialize(keysize);",
    "description": "The key size for the RSA algorithm is not explicitly specified and it uses the default value of 1024 bits. This key size is considered insecure by today's standards and may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Specify an appropriate key size for the RSA algorithm, such as 2048 bits or higher."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");",
    "description": "The RSA algorithm is vulnerable to certain attacks, such as the Bleichenbacher attack, when used for certain purposes, such as encrypting session cookies.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more modern and secure algorithm, such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), for these purposes."
  }
]
```

Additionally, the code does not handle potential exceptions properly, which could lead to security issues. It is recommended to use proper exception handling to ensure that errors are handled gracefully and securely.
