    "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();",
    "description": "The code uses the `toString()` method of the `char[]` array to convert it to a string, then converts the string to a byte array using the `getBytes()` method. This is insecure because the `toString()` method may return a string representation of the `char[]` array that includes additional characters, such as the array's length or class name. These additional characters can be used to attack the MAC.",
