    "description": "The cryptographic key is stored as a string literal in the source code, which makes it vulnerable to being easily discovered by attackers.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong, unique cryptographic key and store it securely, such as in a hardware security module (HSM) or a key management system."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inappropriate Key Derivation Function or PRNG",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The key derivation function used to generate the AES key is insecure. The `toString()` method on a `char[]` returns the string representation of the array, which is not suitable for use as a cryptographic key. Additionally, the `Arrays.copyOf()` method is used to truncate the key to 16 bytes, which may result in a weak key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to generate the AES key. Ensure that the key is of sufficient length and entropy."
