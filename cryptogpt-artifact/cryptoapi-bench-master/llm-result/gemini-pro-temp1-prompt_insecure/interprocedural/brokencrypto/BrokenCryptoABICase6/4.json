  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded `crypto` variable to generate a key for encryption. This makes the choice of encryption algorithm dependent on a user-supplied value, which could allow an attacker to specify a weak or insecure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure key generation method, such as `KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")`, which uses a strong and well-known encryption algorithm."
