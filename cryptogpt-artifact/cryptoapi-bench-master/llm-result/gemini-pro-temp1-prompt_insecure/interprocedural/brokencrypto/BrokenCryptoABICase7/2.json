    "description": "The code uses `RC4` algorithm for encryption, which is considered weak and insecure. `RC4` is vulnerable to various attacks, including collision attacks and stream cipher attacks.",

    "recommendation": "Avoid storing the encryption key in plain text. Instead, use a secure key management system."
