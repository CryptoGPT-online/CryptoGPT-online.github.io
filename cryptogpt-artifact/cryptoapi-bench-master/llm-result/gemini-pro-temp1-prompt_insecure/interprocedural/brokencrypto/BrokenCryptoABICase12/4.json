    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "String cryptoAlgo = c;\nmethod1(cryptoAlgo);",
    "description": "The code takes a user-supplied string `c` which is an algorithm name, and passes it to the `method1` function without any validation. This is dangerous because an attacker could pass in an insecure or broken algorithm, leading to a compromise of the cryptographic operations performed by the code.",
    "recommendation": "The code should validate the `c` input string to ensure that it contains a cryptographically secure algorithm. Additionally, the code should use a more secure algorithm, such as AES-256 or ChaCha20, instead of Blowfish, which is considered insecure."
