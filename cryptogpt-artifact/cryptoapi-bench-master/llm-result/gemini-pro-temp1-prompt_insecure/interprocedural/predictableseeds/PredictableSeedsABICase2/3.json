    "description": "The SecureRandom constructor is initialized with a single byte seed, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. This can lead to predictable or guessable random numbers, which can be exploited in attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is seeded with a strong source of entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a larger seed size to improve the randomness of the generated numbers."
