    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The seed used for `SecureRandom` is generated using a simple byte variable, which is not cryptographically secure. It makes the generated random numbers predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) like `java.security.SecureRandom` and seed it with a strong and unpredictable seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Also, consider using a more complex algorithm like PBKDF2 or HKDF to generate the seed."
