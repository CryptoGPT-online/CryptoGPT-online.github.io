    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with a weak seed, which could lead to predictable and insecure random numbers. In this case, the seed is simply a byte array that can be easily guessed or manipulated, making it insecure for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed for the `SecureRandom` class, such as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or a hardware random number generator (HRNG)."
