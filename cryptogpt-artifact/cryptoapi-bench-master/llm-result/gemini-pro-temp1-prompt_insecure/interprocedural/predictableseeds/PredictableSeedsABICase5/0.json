    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The seed value used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is inadequate, as it is a short byte array and does not provide sufficient entropy. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and long seed value to initialize the SecureRandom instance. One way to do this is to use the SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() method."
