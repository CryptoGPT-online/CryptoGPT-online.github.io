    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Seed Initialization",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a weak seed, which can lead to predictable random number generation. This makes it easier for an attacker to guess random values generated by the application, potentially compromising security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and seed it with a strong, unpredictable seed. The seed should be at least 128 bits in length and should be generated using a secure random number generator."
