    "description": "Using a fixed seed value for `SecureRandom` is insecure as it makes the generated random numbers predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator like `SecureRandom` and seed it with a strong seed value, such as one generated from `/dev/urandom` or a similar source of entropy."
