    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Seeding of Random Number Generator",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The seed value used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is not cryptographically secure. An attacker could potentially guess or predict the seed value, which would allow them to predict the sequence of random numbers generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and seed it with a truly random seed value. For example, you could use the `java.security.SecureRandom` class and seed it with a value obtained from a hardware random number generator."
