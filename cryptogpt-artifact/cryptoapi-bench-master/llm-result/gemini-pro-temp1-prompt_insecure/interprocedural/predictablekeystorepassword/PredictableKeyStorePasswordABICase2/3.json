    "description": "The encryption key 'changeit' is hard-coded in the source code, which makes it easily accessible to attackers.",

    "description": "The code uses the default JKS (Java Key Store) algorithm, which is known to be vulnerable to various attacks.",

    "recommendation": "Avoid loading keystores from untrusted sources or over unencrypted channels. Use secure protocols like HTTPS or TLS when accessing remote keystores."
