1. **CWE-327: Use of a Key-Encryption Key (KEK) in Cryptographic Algorithm**: This misuse occurs in line 20, where the same key (encryptKey) is used for both key-encryption and data-encryption. Key-encryption is used to encrypt a symmetric key with a public key, while data-encryption is used to encrypt data with the symmetric key. Using the same key for both purposes can lead to security vulnerabilities because it weakens the cryptographic strength of the key.
2. **CWE-297: Improper RSA Key Wrapping**: This misuse occurs in line 22, where the keystore is loaded from a URL using the encryptKey as the keystore password. However, the keystore password is not properly protected and can be easily compromised. This can allow an attacker to access the keystore and obtain the private keys, which can be used to decrypt sensitive data.

To fix these misuses, you should:
- Use distinct keys for key-encryption and data-encryption.
- Encrypt the keystore password using a secure key-encryption algorithm.

These countermeasures will help to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your code.
