    "description": "The MD4 algorithm is no longer considered secure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD4 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
