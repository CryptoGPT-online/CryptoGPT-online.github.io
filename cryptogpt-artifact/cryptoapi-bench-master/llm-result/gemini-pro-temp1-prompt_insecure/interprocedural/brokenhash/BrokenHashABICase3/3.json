    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. MD4 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
