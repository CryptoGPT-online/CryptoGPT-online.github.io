    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses SHA1, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for secure applications. SHA1 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that different inputs can produce the same hash value, leading to a security compromise.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
