    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm for hashing, which is considered broken and insecure. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD5."
