    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses MD2 for hashing, which is a known weak algorithm and is no longer considered secure. It is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that it is relatively easy to find two messages that hash to the same value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
