    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses a MessageDigest instance with the algorithm specified by the `crypto` variable. The `crypto` variable is initialized with the value of the `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` constant, which is set to \"MD4\". MD4 is a cryptographic hash function that is considered broken and should not be used for security purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of MD4."
