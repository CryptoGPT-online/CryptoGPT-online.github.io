    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is a broken and insecure cryptographic algorithm. Attackers can easily find collisions and preimages for MD4, which makes it unsuitable for use in secure applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
