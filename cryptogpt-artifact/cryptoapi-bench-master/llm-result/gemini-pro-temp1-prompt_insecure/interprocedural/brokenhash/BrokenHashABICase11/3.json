    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm for hashing, which is a broken algorithm and no longer considered secure. An attacker can easily find collisions for MD4, which makes it unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
