    "description": "The MessageDigest algorithm is initialized with a String value obtained from the 'crypto' variable, which is derived from the hard-coded 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO' value. This approach is insecure because it allows an attacker to specify the algorithm to be used, potentially leading to the use of a weak or compromised algorithm.",
