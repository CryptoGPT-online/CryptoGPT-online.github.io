    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. Attackers can easily find collisions for MD5 hashes, which means they can create two different messages that produce the same hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
