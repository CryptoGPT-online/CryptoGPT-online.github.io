    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses MessageDigest with the MD5 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a modern and secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of MD5."
