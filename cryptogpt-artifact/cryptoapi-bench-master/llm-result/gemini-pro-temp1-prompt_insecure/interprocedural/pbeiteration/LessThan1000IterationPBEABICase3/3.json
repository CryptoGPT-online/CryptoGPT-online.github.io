    "vulnerable_code": "method2(count,random);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` instance (`random`) is passed as an argument to `method2`, where it is used to generate a salt. However, the value of `random` may have been compromised before it is passed to `method2`, leading to the generation of a predictable salt and weakening the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the salt within the `method1` function using a new `SecureRandom` instance, ensuring that the salt is generated using a fresh, uncompromised random number generator."
