    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_COUNT = \"20\";",
    "description": "Hard-coding the value of `DEFAULT_COUNT` in the source code can lead to a fixed value for the salt used in PBKDF2, making it easier for attackers to crack the password.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hard-coding values for cryptographic parameters like salt. Instead, generate salt randomly for each password."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Session Handling",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static char[] COUNT;",
    "description": "The `COUNT` array is declared as a static field, which means it is shared among all instances of the `L2` class. This makes it possible for one instance to modify the `COUNT` array, potentially affecting the security of other instances.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid declaring sensitive data as static fields. If you need to share data among instances, use thread-safe mechanisms like `ConcurrentHashMap`."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not inherently broken or risky, but it requires a strong entropy source to generate truly random numbers. If the entropy source is weak, an attacker could potentially predict the generated random numbers and compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the `SecureRandom` instance is initialized with a strong entropy source. You can use `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows for this purpose."
