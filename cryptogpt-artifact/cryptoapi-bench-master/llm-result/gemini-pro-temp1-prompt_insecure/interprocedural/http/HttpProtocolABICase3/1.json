    "description": "The code uses `new URL(url)` to create a `URL` object without validating the certificate of the URL. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept the communication and impersonate the legitimate server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a URLConnection object to connect to the URL and validate the certificate before proceeding."
