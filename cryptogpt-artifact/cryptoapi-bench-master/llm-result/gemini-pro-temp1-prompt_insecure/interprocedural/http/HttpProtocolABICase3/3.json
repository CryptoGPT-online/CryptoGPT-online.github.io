    "vulnerable_code": "String url2 = url;",
    "description": "The code takes user input from `url` and passes it to `method2` without properly validating it. This can lead to injection attacks, where an attacker can provide malicious input that can be executed by the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a library that provides input validation and encoding, such as OWASP ESAPI, to validate and encode user input before passing it to other methods or functions."
