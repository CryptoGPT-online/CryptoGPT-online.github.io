    "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage in a Cookie",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static char[] url;",
    "description": "The 'url' variable is declared as a character array, which means its contents are stored in plaintext. This makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, as anyone with access to the application's memory could potentially read the contents of the 'url' variable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure storage mechanism, such as a cryptographic hash function, to store the 'url' variable. This will make it more difficult for attackers to read the contents of the variable, even if they have access to the application's memory."
