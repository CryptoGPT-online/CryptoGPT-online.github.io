    "description": "Hard-coding credentials, such as the URL in this case, is a security risk as it makes them easily accessible to attackers. Credentials should be securely stored and retrieved from a secure source.",

    "description": "Storing passwords or keys in plaintext, such as the URL in this case, is a security risk as it makes them easily accessible to attackers. Passwords and keys should be securely hashed or encrypted before storage.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256, to hash the URL before storing it in the character arrays."

    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(url.toString()));",
    "description": "The code uses the URL constructor without specifying a URLStreamHandler or a URLConnection, which means that it will use the default URLStreamHandler and URLConnection implementations. These default implementations may not perform proper certificate validation, leaving the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Consider explicitly specifying a URLStreamHandler or a URLConnection that enforces proper certificate validation."
