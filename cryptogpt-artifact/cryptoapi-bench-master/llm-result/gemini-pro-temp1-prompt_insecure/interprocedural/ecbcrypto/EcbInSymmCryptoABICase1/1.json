    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code is using `Cipher.getInstance` to get an instance of the cipher, but it is not checking the algorithm name before using it. This could allow an attacker to specify a weak or insecure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Always check the algorithm name before using `Cipher.getInstance`. For example, you could check if the algorithm name is one of the following: `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding`, `AES/GCM/NoPadding`, or `RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding`. If it is not, you should throw an exception or otherwise handle the error."
