    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses the default key size for AES, which is 128 bits. This is considered to be inadequate for modern security standards, as it can be broken with a brute-force attack in a reasonable amount of time.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 256 bits, to protect against brute-force attacks. For example, replace the above code with the following:\n\n```java\nKeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nkeyGen.init(256);\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();\n```"
