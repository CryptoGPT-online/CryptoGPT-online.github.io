    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses the default key size for AES, which is 128 bits. This key size is considered insecure for many applications. It is recommended to use a key size of at least 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 256 bits, by passing the appropriate parameter to `KeyGenerator.getInstance()`. For example, `KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", 256)`. If using Java 9+, consider using `KeyGenerator.init(256)`. Consult the documentation of the underlying cryptographic library for more information on supported key sizes."
