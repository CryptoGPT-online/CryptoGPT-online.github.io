    "description": "The code uses `AES` without specifying the key size. By default, `AES` is initialized with a 128-bit key, which is considered insecure by modern standards. It is recommended to use at least a 256-bit key for adequate encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly when generating the `AES` key, e.g., `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES/256\");`"
