    "description": "The code uses DES algorithm which is considered weak and insecure. DES has a key size of only 56 bits, which can be easily broken using brute-force attacks.",

    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode which is vulnerable to various attacks, such as pattern recognition attacks. In ECB mode, each block of plaintext is encrypted independently, which makes it easier for attackers to identify patterns and exploit them.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter Mode)."
