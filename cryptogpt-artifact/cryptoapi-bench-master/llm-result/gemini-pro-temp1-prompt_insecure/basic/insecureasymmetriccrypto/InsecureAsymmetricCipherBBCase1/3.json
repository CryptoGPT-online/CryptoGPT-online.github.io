    "description": "The RSA algorithm, when used without proper padding, is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Padding is used to ensure that the message being encrypted is of a fixed length, which is a requirement for certain cryptographic algorithms like RSA.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure padding scheme, such as OAEP padding, when using RSA to protect against padding oracle attacks."
