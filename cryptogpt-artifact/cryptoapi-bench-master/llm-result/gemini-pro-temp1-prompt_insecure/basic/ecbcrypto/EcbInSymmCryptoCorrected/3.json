    "description": "Using ECB mode in symmetric cryptography is insecure. ECB mode is deterministic, meaning that identical plaintext blocks always produce identical ciphertext blocks. This can be exploited by attackers to identify patterns in the data and potentially recover the plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a different mode of operation, such as CBC or CTR, instead of ECB."
