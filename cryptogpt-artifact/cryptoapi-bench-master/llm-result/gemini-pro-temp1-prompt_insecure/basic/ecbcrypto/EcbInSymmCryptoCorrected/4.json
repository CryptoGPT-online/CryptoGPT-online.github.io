    "misuse": "ECB Mode in Symmetric Cryptography (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "ECB mode is a block cipher mode of operation where each block of plaintext is encrypted independently using the same key. This makes ECB mode vulnerable to attacks where patterns in the plaintext can be exploited to reveal information about the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC or CTR mode."
