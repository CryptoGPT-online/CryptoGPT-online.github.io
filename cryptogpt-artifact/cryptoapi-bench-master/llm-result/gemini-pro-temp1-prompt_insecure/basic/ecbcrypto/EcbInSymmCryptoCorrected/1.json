    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses the default AES key size, which is 128 bits. This key size is considered weak and can be broken with moderate effort.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 256 bits, by passing the appropriate parameter to the `KeyGenerator` constructor."

    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The secret key is stored in a variable without any protection. This makes it vulnerable to theft by attackers who gain access to the system.",
    "recommendation": "Store the secret key in a secure key store or use a key encryption key (KEK) to encrypt the secret key."

    "recommendation": "Use a secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM, instead of ECB."
