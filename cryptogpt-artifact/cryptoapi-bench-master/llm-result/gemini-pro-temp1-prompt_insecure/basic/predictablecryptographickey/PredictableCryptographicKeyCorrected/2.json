    "description": "The key size for AES is fixed to 16 bytes, which is considered inadequate by modern standards. An attacker could potentially brute-force the key and decrypt the data.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to at least 256 bits (32 bytes) to provide a more secure level of encryption."
