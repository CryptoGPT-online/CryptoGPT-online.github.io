    "misuse": "Weak Key (CWE-321)",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();",
    "description": "The key is derived from a password string using the `getBytes()` method, which uses the platform's default character encoding. This may result in a weak key if the password contains non-ASCII characters or if the platform's default encoding is weak.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong key generation algorithm, such as `SecureRandom`, to generate a random key. Alternatively, use a key derivation function (KDF) to derive a key from a password string."

    "description": "The key is hardcoded in the source code, which makes it easy for an attacker to obtain the key and compromise the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding cryptographic keys in the source code. Instead, store the keys securely, such as in a key management system or a hardware security module (HSM)."

    "recommendation": "Use a longer key size, such as 256 bits, for better security."
