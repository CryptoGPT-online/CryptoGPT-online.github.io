    "description": "The key length of 16 bytes (128 bits) is too short and provides inadequate encryption strength. Current recommendations suggest using a key length of at least 256 bits.",

    "recommendation": "Avoid hard-coding credentials in the code. Instead, use a secure method to store and retrieve the password, such as a password manager or a key management system."
