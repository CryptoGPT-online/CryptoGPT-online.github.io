    "description": "The code uses the PBEKeySpec class with a weak key length of only 16 bytes, which is considered insecure. Key lengths should be at least 256 bits (32 bytes) to provide adequate security.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to a minimum of 256 bits (e.g., `keyLength = 256`)."
