    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "SHA1 is a cryptographic hash function that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be used to break digital signatures and other security mechanisms that rely on SHA1.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
