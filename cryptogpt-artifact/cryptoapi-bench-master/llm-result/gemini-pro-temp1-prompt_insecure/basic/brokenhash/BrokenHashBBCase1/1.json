    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "SHA1 is a cryptographic hash function that is considered broken and should not be used for security purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be exploited to create fraudulent certificates or signatures.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of SHA1."
