    "description": "SHA1 is a broken cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This weakness can be exploited to create fraudulent certificates, digital signatures, and other types of attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
