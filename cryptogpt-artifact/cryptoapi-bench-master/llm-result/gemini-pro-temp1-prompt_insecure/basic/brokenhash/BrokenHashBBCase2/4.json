    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered to be insecure due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. This means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD5 hash, which can be used to bypass security mechanisms that rely on MD5 for data integrity or authentication.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD5."
