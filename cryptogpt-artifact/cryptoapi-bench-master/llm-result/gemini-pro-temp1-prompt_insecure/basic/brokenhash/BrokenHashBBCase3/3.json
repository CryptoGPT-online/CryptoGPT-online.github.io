    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "The MD4 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that two different messages can produce the same hash value. This weakness makes it unsuitable for applications where data integrity or authenticity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
