    "description": "The code snippet shows a custom hostname verifier that always returns `true`, which is insecure. This means that the hostname of the server is not verified against the hostname specified in the server's certificate, making it possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to impersonate the server and intercept the communication.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by checking if the hostname in the server's certificate matches the hostname of the server being connected to."
