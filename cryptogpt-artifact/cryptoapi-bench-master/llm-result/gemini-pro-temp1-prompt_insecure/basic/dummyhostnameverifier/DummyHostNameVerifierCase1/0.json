    "vulnerable_code": "return true;",
    "description": "The code always returns true, which means that any certificate will be accepted, regardless of its validity or trustworthiness. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server or intercept communications.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation by checking the certificate's validity, hostname, and issuer. Use a library like 'jsse' to simplify this process."
