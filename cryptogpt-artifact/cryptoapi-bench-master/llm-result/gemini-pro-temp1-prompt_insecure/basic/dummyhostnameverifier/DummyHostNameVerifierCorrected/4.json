    "misuse": "CWE-297: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "The code uses the default hostname verifier provided by HttpsURLConnection, which relies on the system's default trust manager and hostname verifier. This may lead to vulnerabilities if the system's trust manager and hostname verifier are not properly configured or if they have known vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hostname verifier, such as one that verifies the hostname against a known list of trusted certificates, or implement your own hostname verification logic."
