    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\n    long l = sr.nextLong();\n    sr.setSeed(l);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is re-seeded with a seed generated from its own output, which is weak and predictable. This can lead to the generation of predictable random numbers, which can be exploited in cryptographic attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed for the SecureRandom object. A common approach is to use a combination of system properties, such as the current time and the process ID, to generate the seed."
