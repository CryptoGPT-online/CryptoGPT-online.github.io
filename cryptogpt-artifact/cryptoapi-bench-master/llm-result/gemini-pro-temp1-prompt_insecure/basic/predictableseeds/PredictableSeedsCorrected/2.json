    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is seeded with a strong source of entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a more robust seeding strategy, such as seeding the CSPRNG with a combination of system properties and/or user input."
