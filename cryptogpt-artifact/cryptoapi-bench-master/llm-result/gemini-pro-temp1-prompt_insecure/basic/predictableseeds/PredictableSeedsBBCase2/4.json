    "description": "Using a single byte as a seed for SecureRandom is not sufficient to generate unpredictable random numbers. An attacker could easily guess the seed and predict the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), or use a larger seed value."
