    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with an inadequate seed, which makes the generated random numbers predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) with a strong seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and avoid using a static seed value."
