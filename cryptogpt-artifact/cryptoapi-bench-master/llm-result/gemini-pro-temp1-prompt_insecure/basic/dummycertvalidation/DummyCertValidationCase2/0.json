    "vulnerable_code": "public class D2 implements X509TrustManager { ... }",
    "description": "The `D2` class implements the `X509TrustManager` interface without performing any certificate validation. This means that any certificate presented by the server will be accepted, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Implement the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods to perform proper certificate validation. You can use the `X509Certificate` class and its methods, such as `verify`, to validate certificates against a trusted certificate authority (CA) or using other criteria."
