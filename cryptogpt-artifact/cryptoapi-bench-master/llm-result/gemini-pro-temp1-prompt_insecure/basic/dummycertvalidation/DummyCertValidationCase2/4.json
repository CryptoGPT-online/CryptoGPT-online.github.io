    "misuse": "CWE-256: Weak Encryption Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "new D2()",
    "description": "The code is using the `D2` class as an `X509TrustManager`, which is insecure because it does not perform any certificate validation and accepts all certificates. This means that an attacker could present a malicious certificate to the application, and the application would trust it.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure `X509TrustManager` implementation that performs certificate validation, such as the `X509TrustManager` class provided by the Java API."
