    "description": "Using the default SSLSocketFactory may result in weak encryption algorithms being used, which could allow an attacker to intercept and decrypt network traffic.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure SSLSocketFactory implementation, such as one that supports TLS 1.2 or higher and strong cipher suites."
