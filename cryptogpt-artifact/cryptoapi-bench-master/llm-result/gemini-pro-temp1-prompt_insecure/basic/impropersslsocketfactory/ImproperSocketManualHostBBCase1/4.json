    "description": "Using the default SSL/TLS configuration may lead to insecure connections due to outdated or weak ciphers, protocols, or lack of proper certificate validation. Relying on defaults can expose applications to known vulnerabilities or attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Configure SSL/TLS settings explicitly, including cipher suites, protocols, and certificate validation mechanisms, to ensure a secure connection. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure defaults and allows customization."
