    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code generates a salt value using the SecureRandom class, however, it is not seeded before being used. This can lead to predictable salt values and weaken the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "To securely initialize the salt value, you should seed the SecureRandom instance with a cryptographically secure random seed, such as the output of /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems or CryptGenRandom on Windows."
