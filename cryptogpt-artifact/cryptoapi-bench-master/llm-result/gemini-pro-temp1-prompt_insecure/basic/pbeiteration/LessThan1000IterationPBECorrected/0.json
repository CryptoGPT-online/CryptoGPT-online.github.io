    "description": "The provided iteration count (`count`) for PBKDF2 is too low. A low iteration count makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password and compromise the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 10,000 or use a more modern key derivation function like bcrypt or scrypt."
