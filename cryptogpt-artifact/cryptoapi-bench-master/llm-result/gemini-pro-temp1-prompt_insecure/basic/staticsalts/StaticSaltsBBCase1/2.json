    "description": "The code uses a weak KDF (Key Derivation Function) with a low iteration count, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks. This iteration count is too low to provide adequate security against modern attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 100,000 or more, to make it more resistant to brute-force attacks."
