    "description": "The code uses a weak KDF (Key Derivation Function) to generate a key from a password. The salt is too short (only 1 byte) and the iteration count is too low (1020). This makes it easy for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger KDF, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, with a longer salt and a higher iteration count."
