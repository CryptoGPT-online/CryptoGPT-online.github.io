    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` with `nextInt()` to generate an IV. However, `nextInt()` doesn't produce cryptographically secure random numbers. This can make the IV predictable and compromise the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate the IV."
