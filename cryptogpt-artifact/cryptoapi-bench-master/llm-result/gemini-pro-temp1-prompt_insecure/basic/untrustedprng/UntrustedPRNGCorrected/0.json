    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class uses a default algorithm that may not be secure enough for all use cases. Using a weak random number generator can lead to predictable or guessable outputs, which can compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom` with an appropriate algorithm like `SHA1PRNG` or `DRBG`."
