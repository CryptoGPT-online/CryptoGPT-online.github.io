    "vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();",
    "description": "The `Random` class uses a linear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm, which is a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). This means that an attacker could potentially predict the sequence of numbers generated by the PRNG, which could allow them to compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure PRNG, such as `SecureRandom`, instead of `Random`."
