"description": "In the provided code, the `H1` class is using the `C1` class to perform a cryptographic operation. However, the `C1` class is using a less secure algorithm for the operation, which could be vulnerable to attack.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the `C1` class should use a more secure algorithm for the cryptographic operation. Additionally, the `H1` class should check for the availability of the more secure algorithm and use it if possible."
