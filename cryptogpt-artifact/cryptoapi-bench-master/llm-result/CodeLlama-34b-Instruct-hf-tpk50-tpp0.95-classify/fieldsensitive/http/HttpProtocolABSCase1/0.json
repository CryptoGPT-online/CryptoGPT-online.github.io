        "description": "The method is using the `URL` class to create a URL object from a string, but the string is user-provided and can be manipulated to perform a redirection attack. The `URL` class is vulnerable to redirection attacks, and should not be used to create URLs from user-provided input.",
        "recommendation": "Use a safer alternative to create URLs, such as the `URI` class, which is immune to redirection attacks."
