 {"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(passedHostname, passedSoc);", "description": "The use of the default SSLSocketFactory and SSLContext in Java can lead to the selection of less secure algorithms during the SSL/TLS handshake. This can potentially allow for downgrade attacks and compromise the security of the connection.", "recommendation": "Use the TLSv1.2 protocol or higher, and set the 'Enabled Protocols' and 'Enabled Ciphers' properties of the SSLSocket to restrict the selection of algorithms to more secure options."}
