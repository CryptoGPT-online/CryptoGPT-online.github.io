[
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
"description": "The use of SSLSocketFactory.getDefault() without specifying the protocol or the cipher suite allows the client to connect to a server using a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm, which can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the communication.",
"recommendation": "Use a specific protocol and cipher suite, and make sure they are secure and up-to-date. For example, use TLS 1.3 with AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
