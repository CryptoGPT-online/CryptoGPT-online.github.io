    "vulnerable_code": "C1(20)",
    "description": "The encryption algorithm used in the C1 class is insecure. A 20-bit encryption algorithm is not secure enough and can be easily broken. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as AES with a key length of at least 128 bits.",

    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec class is used to generate a PBE key derivation function (KDF) with a given salt and iteration count. However, the iteration count used in this code is very low and can be easily broken. It is recommended to use a higher iteration count, such as 10000 or higher, to make the KDF more secure.",

    "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random values, but the instance is not properly seeded. This can lead to predictable output, which can be easily exploited by an attacker to break the encryption. It is recommended to use a properly seeded instance of SecureRandom.",
    "recommendation": "Use a properly seeded instance of SecureRandom by calling the setSeed() method with a secure seed, such as a cryptographically secure random number generator."
