        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "MD2",
        "description": "The MD2 hash algorithm is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm that should not be used for any purpose. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions and other attacks, and it is no longer considered secure. In this code, the `C4` class is using the MD2 algorithm, which is a clear misuse of a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of MD2 with a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
