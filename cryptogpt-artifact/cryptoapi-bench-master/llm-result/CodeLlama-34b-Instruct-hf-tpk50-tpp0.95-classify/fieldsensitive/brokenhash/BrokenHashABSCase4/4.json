"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "crypto",
"description": "The use of hardcoded credentials in the code is a vulnerability as it can be easily discovered and used to compromise the system.",
"recommendation": "Do not store sensitive data, such as credentials, in hardcoded form. Instead, use secure storage mechanisms, such as environment variables or secure configuration files."

"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "MD2",
"description": "The use of MD2 as a cryptographic hash algorithm is considered to be less secure than other algorithms, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. This can lead to vulnerabilities in the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date cryptographic hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
