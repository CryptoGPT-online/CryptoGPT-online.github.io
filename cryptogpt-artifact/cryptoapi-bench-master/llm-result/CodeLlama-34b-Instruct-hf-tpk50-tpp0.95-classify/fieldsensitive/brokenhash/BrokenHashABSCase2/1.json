"vulnerable_code": "MD5",
"description": "The 'MD5' algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It can be easily broken and can lead to attacks such as collision attacks, preimage attacks, and forgery attacks. It is recommended to use a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
