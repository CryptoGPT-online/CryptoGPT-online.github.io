"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(passedAlgo)",
"description": "The application uses the passed in algorithm without checking if it is a valid and secure algorithm. An attacker could potentially pass in a weak or broken algorithm, which could compromise the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Always check the validity and security of the passed in algorithm before using it."

"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",

"description": "The application uses a predefined default algorithm if the passed in algorithm is empty, which could lead to a predictable encryption key. An attacker could potentially use this predictability to decrypt the data.",
"recommendation": "Generate a random key for each encryption, rather than using a predefined default algorithm."
