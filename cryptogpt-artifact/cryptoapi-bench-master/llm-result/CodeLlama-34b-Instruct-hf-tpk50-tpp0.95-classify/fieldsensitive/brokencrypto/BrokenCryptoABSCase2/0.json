  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "C3.encrypt(String txt, String passedAlgo)",
    "description": "The method C3.encrypt() takes a passedAlgo argument that is not used to initialize the Cipher object. This can lead to the use of a weak or broken encryption algorithm, which can compromise the security of the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the Cipher object is properly initialized with a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The method C3.encrypt() uses a hardcoded algorithm, which can lead to a low encryption strength. Additionally, the use of a weak or broken encryption algorithm, such as Blowfish, can compromise the security of the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA, and ensure that the encryption strength is sufficient for the intended use."
