[
{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
"description": "The encryption strength is inadequate because the iteration count is too low (less than 1000).",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 1000."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
"description": "The salt is a hardcoded value and not randomly generated, which may make it easier for an attacker to guess or brute-force the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Generate a random salt value and use it for encryption."
}
