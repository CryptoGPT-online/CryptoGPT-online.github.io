"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()",
"description": "The SSL socket is using the default algorithm, which may be less secure than the latest and most secure algorithm available on the platform.",
"recommendation": "Use the latest and most secure algorithm available on the platform by specifying it explicitly."

"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String hostname = \"my.host.name\"",
"description": "The hostname is hardcoded, which makes it easy for an attacker to identify the target host and launch an attack.",
"recommendation": "Do not hardcode credentials. Use a configuration file or environment variables to specify the hostname and other sensitive information."

{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostname,soc)",
"description": "The SSL socket is created without proper certificate validation, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Always validate the certificate of the remote host before establishing a connection. Use a trusted certificate authority (CA) to verify the authenticity of the certificate."
