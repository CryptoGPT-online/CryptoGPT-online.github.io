 {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)));", "description": "The number of iterations for PBKDF2 is set to a static value which is less than the recommended value of 64000. This can cause the encryption to be weak.", "recommendation": "Use a more robust method for generating the number of iterations, such as a secure random number generator."}
