"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "lt.go(count)",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is using a weak iteration count of 20, which can be brute-forced quickly. It should be increased to at least 1000000.",
"recommendation": "Replace the PBEParameterSpec constructor with a stronger one that uses a higher iteration count, such as 1000000."
