        "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbe = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
        "description": "The PBEParameterSpec class is not intended for direct use as a random number generator. It is only used as a container for the salt and iteration count of a PBE algorithm. Using it to generate random numbers can lead to predictable values and can compromise the security of the cryptographic system.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate random numbers. Do not use a cryptographic algorithm for generating random numbers."
