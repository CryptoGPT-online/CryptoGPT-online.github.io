    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "description": "The code uses the SHA1 algorithm, which is a weak cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for secure purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA256 or SHA512, and consider using a more secure hash function, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to mitigate the risk of hash collisions."
