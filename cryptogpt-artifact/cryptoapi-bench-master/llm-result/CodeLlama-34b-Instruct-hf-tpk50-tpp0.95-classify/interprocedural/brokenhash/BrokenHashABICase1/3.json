{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The method `MessageDigest.getInstance()` takes the algorithm name as a parameter and returns a `MessageDigest` object that implements the specified algorithm. In this code, the algorithm name is provided as a variable, which can lead to a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm being used if the variable is not properly controlled. For example, an attacker could manipulate the `crypto` variable to use a weak or broken hashing algorithm, leading to a security vulnerability.",
"recommendation": "Use a hardcoded algorithm name that is known to be secure, such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`, instead of a variable. If you must use a variable, make sure it is properly controlled and sanitized to prevent an attacker from manipulating it."
