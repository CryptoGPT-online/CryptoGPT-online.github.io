 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))", "description": "The crypto variable is assigned a value of \"MD5\" in the go2() method, which is a weak cryptographic hash function. The go3() method then assigns the value of crypto to another variable called crypto, which is then used in the go() method to create a MessageDigest instance with the specified algorithm. This is a violation of the CWE-327 misuse, as the algorithm used is weak and vulnerable to collision attacks.", "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, use a stronger cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 or higher, and avoid using weak or broken algorithms."}
