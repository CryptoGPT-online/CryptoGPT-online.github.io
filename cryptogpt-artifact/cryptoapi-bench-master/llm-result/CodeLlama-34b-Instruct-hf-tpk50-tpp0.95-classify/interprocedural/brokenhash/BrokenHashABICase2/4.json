        "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be used to generate weak hashes that can be easily cracked.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of MD5. Also, consider using a secure password hashing algorithm like Argon2 or Bcrypt."
