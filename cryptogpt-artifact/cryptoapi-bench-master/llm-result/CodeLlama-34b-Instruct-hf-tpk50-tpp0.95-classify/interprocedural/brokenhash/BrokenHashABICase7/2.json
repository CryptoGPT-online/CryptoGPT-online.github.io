        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The `crypto` variable is assigned the value of `DEFAULT_CRYPTO`, which is \"MD4\". MD4 is a weak hash function that is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions and can be easily broken by attackers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4. These hash functions are designed to be more resistant to collisions and have been extensively tested and reviewed by the cryptographic community."
