        "description": "MD4 is a broken cryptographic hash function and should not be used for any security-related purposes. It is not collision resistant and can be easily attacked using brute force attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of MD4 with a more secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. For example, replace `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")` with `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")`."
