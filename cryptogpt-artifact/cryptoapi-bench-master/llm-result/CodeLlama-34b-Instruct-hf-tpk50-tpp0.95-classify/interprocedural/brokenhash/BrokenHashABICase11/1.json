"vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"MD4\";",
"description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use more secure algorithms such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
"recommendation": "Replace the usage of MD4 algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
