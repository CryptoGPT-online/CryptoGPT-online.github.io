 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
"description": "The use of a low iteration count (1020) in the PBEParameterSpec constructor is a vulnerability, as it reduces the security of the hash function. A higher iteration count is recommended to increase the computation time and make it more resistant to brute-force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count (e.g. 10000 or more) to increase the security of the hash function."
