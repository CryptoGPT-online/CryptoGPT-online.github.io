        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The use of the Blowfish algorithm, which is considered weak and vulnerable to brute force attacks, as evidenced by its small key size and fast encryption/decryption speeds.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger, more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA, and ensure that the key size is of appropriate length for the algorithm being used."
