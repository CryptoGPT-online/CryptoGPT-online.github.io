    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The 'crypto' parameter is passed as a user-provided string, which allows an attacker to specify a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm. This can lead to a weak encryption key being generated, which can be easily cracked by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Do not pass user-provided data to 'KeyGenerator.getInstance()'. Instead, use a hardcoded string that specifies a strong and secure cryptographic algorithm. Additionally, make sure to use a secure key derivation function (KDF) to generate the encryption key."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"Blowfish\";",
    "description": "The 'Blowfish' algorithm is not considered to be a secure algorithm for encrypting data. It has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks and should not be used for new code. Instead, use a stronger and more secure algorithm such as AES or ChaCha20-Poly1305.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'Blowfish' with a more secure algorithm when generating the encryption key."
