 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"RC2\";",
"description": "The code uses the RC2 algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used. The use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms can lead to vulnerabilities in the cryptographic system, such as weak keys, which can be easily guessed or cracked.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, and a secure key generation method, such as PBKDF2."
