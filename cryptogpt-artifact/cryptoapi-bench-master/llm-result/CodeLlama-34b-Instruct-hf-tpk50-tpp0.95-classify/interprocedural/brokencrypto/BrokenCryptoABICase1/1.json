        "vulnerable_code": "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding",
        "description": "The use of the DES algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for encryption. It is vulnerable to attacks such as brute force attacks and frequency analysis.",
        "recommendation": "Use a modern and secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a sufficient key size and a secure padding scheme such as PKCS7."

        "vulnerable_code": "DES",
        "description": "The use of the DES algorithm as a hardcoded value in the code is a security risk as it could be easily extracted and used to compromise the system.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the key and avoid hardcoding it in the code."
