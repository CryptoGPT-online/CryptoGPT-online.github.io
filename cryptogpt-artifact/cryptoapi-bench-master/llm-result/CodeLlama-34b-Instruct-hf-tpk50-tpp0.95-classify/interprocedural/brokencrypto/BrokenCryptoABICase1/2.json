        "description": "The code uses the weak encryption algorithm DES (Data Encryption Standard) which has been considered broken for over two decades and should not be used for any purpose. The use of DES poses a serious security risk and should be immediately addressed.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of DES with a more secure algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and a stronger key size. Additionally, the mode of operation should be changed to a more secure mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)."

        "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";\nString keyAlgo = \"DES\";",
        "description": "The code hardcodes the encryption algorithm and key size, which can make it difficult to change the encryption parameters in the future. Additionally, hardcoding sensitive information such as encryption keys makes it vulnerable to disclosure.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the hardcoded encryption algorithm and key size with a configurable parameter that can be changed without modifying the code. Also, ensure that the encryption key is not stored in the code or in a configuration file, but rather generated securely at runtime."
