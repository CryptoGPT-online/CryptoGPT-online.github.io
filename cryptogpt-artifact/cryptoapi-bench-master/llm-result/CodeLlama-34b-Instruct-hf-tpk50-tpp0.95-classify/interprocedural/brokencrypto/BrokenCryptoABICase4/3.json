 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The use of RC2 as a cryptographic algorithm is considered insecure because it is a weak block cipher that has been cracked. The key length of RC2 is only 64 bits, which is too small to provide adequate security against modern attacks.",
"recommendation": "The recommended solution is to use a stronger cryptographic algorithm such as AES or RSA, with a key length of at least 128 bits or 2048 bits, respectively. Additionally, it is important to regularly update the crypto library and the cryptographic algorithms used to ensure that they are up-to-date and secure."
