[ {"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
"description": "The code uses a hardcoded key, which can be easily extracted and used by an attacker to access the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Do not hardcode credentials. Instead, use a secure method to store and manage credentials, such as environment variables or a secure credential store."},

"vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
"description": "The code uses a predictable key generation method that is not secure. The use of 'defaultkey' as a key is not secure and can be easily guessed by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure method to generate random keys, such as the Java SecureRandom class."}]
