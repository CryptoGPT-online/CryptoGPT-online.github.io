 Here is the JSON response:
[
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();",
"description": "The function uses the default `key.getBytes()` method to convert a string to a byte array, which can result in non-deterministic output and vulnerabilities due to potential issues with the platform's default charset. A better approach would be to use a specific, consistent charset such as UTF-8.",
"recommendation": "Use a specific, consistent charset such as UTF-8 for converting strings to byte arrays in cryptographic operations."
