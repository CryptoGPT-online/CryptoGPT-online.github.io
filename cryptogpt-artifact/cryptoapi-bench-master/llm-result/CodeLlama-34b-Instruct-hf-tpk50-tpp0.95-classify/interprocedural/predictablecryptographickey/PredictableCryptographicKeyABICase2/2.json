"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",

"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm with a fixed key, which is a poor practice as it allows for deterministic attacks. The key should be randomly generated and stored securely.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key generation method, such as Java's SecureRandom class, to generate a secure random key. Store the key securely and use it in the encryption process."

"description": "The code uses a hardcoded key for encryption, which is a security vulnerability as it can be easily extracted and used by an attacker to decrypt the data.",
