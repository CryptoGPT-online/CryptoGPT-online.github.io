        "vulnerable_code": "method1(url) and method2(url2) both use URL constructor without specifying the protocol, which may result in selection of less-secure algorithm for certain protocols like HTTPS.",
        "description": "The URL constructor used in method1 and method2 does not specify the protocol, which may result in the selection of a less-secure algorithm for certain protocols like HTTPS. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities such as downgrade attacks. It is recommended to specify the protocol explicitly to ensure the use of a secure algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the URL constructor with a new URL(String protocol, String host, int port, String file) constructor and explicitly specify the protocol as 'https' or 'http' depending on the URL."
