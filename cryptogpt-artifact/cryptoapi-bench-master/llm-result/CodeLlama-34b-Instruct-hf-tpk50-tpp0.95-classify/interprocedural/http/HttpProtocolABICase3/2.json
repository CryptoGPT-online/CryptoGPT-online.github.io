        "vulnerable_code": "method2(String url) throws MalformedURLException {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(new URL(url));\n\t}",
        "description": "The method uses the URL constructor to create a URL object, which could potentially be a security vulnerability if the provided URL is not properly validated and sanitized. This could lead to a MalformedURLException being thrown and could potentially expose the application to a security risk.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the URL constructor with a safer method for parsing and validating URLs, such as the Java URI class."
