        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "H1.go() method",
        "description": "The method uses the URL class of the Java Standard Library to parse the input URL, which does not validate the URL properly. A malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a URL that is not properly formatted, leading to a potential security vulnerability.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure URL parsing library, such as the URLParser class from the Apache Commons library, that properly validates the URL format and prevents potential security vulnerabilities."
