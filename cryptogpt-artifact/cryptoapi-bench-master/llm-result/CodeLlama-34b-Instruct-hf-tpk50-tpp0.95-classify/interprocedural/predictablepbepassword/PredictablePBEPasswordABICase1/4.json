 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.go() method",
"description": "The method uses a password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm with a low iteration count (11010), which can be brute-forced by attackers.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value (e.g., 100000) to make the algorithm more secure."
