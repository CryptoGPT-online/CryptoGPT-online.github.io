        "description": "The salt used in the PBEKeySpec constructor is not generated securely. The SecureRandom class is used to generate the salt, but the salt is not used securely. The salt should be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) and should be of the correct size for the specific cryptographic algorithm being used.",
        "recommendation": "Use a CSPRNG to generate the salt, and make sure to use a secure random number generator (SRNG) that is not predictable or biased. Also, make sure the salt is the correct size for the specific cryptographic algorithm being used."
