"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "The use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding is a weak encryption scheme, as it uses a fixed Initialization Vector (IV) and a small block size, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as ciphertext reuse and padding oracle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption scheme, such as AES/GCM/NoPadding, and generate a random IV for each encryption operation."

"description": "Hardcoding sensitive information, such as default initialization vectors, can lead to vulnerabilities if the source code is compromised or leaked.",
"recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded initialization vector and generate a random one for each encryption operation."
