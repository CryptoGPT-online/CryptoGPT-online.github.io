 {"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")", "description": "The use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding is less secure than AES/GCM/NoPadding. AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding uses CBC block mode, which can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. AES/GCM/NoPadding uses GCM mode, which is a more secure and modern mode.
