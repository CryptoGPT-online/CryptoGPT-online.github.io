"description": "The use of \"AES\" as the cryptographic algorithm is a weak choice. It is a relatively old algorithm and is considered to be insecure. Using a more modern and secure algorithm such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR would be a better choice.",

"description": "The use of a hardcoded initialization vector (IV) is a vulnerability. An attacker could potentially guess the IV and access the encrypted data. A random IV should be used instead.",
