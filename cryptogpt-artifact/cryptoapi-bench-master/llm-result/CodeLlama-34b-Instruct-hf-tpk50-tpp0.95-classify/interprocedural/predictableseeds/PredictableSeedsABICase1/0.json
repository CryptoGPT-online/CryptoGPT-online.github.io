        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
        "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is designed to be used for cryptographic purposes, but it is not secure to use it with a predictable seed. In this code, the `seed` is set to a constant value, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. This can lead to predictable outputs from the `SecureRandom` instance, which can be exploited to compromise the security of the application.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using a predictable seed, use a secure random source such as `/dev/urandom` or `System.security.SecureRandom` to generate a truly random seed. Additionally, consider using a more secure pseudorandom number generator such as `java.security.SecureRandom` which has a stronger security guarantees and is less vulnerable to attacks."
