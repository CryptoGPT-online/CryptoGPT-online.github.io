"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "go3()",
"description": "The method `go3()` sets the `seed` variable to a static value, which is not random enough for secure usage. In this case, the `seed` is set to a constant value, which means the `SecureRandom` instance will always generate the same random numbers.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, you should use a more random and unpredictable value for the `seed` variable. One possible solution is to use a random value generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."
