        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())})",
        "description": "The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm can weaken the security of the system. In this case, the use of a fixed seed for the `SecureRandom` class can lead to predictable random numbers, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. This can compromise the security of the system.",
        "recommendation": "Use a properly generated random seed for the `SecureRandom` class, such as using the `java.util.Random` class or a cryptographic secure random number generator library."
