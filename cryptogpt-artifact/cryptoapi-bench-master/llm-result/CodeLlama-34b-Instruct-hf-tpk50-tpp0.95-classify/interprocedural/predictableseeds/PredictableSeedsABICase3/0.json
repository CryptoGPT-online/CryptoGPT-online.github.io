"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\n        sr.setSeed(seed);\n        int v = sr.nextInt();",
"description": "The use of a non-cryptographically-secure random number generator (SecureRandom) with a static seed is a serious vulnerability. This code will always produce the same output, making it easy for an attacker to predict the next random number. Instead, it is recommended to use a cryptographically-secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, and avoid using static seeds.",
