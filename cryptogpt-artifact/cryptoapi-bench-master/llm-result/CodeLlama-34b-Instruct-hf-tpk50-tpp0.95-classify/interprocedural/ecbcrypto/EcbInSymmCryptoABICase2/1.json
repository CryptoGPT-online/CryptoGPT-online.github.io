 Here is the JSON response for the provided code:
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "description": "The provided crypto algorithm is weak and should not be used for encryption. The algorithm is not secure and can be easily broken by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-GCM, AES-CTR, or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
  }
]

Note: The `CWE-327` misuse is reported for the line `Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))`, as the provided crypto algorithm is weak and can be easily broken by an attacker.
