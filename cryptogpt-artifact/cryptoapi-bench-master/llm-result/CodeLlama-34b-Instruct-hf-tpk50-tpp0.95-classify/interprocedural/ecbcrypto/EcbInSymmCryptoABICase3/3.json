        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The code uses the AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding algorithm, which is a broken algorithm and should not be used for any encryption purpose. ECB mode is deterministic and does not provide semantic security, making it vulnerable to attacks. PKCS5Padding is also a weak padding scheme, as it can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding with a secure and approved algorithm, such as AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding."
