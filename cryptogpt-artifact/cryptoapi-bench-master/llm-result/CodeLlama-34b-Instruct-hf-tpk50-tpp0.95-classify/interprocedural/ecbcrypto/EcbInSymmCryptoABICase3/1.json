        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto)",
        "description": "The code uses the 'AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding' algorithm, which is a vulnerable algorithm due to its inherent flaws. Specifically, it uses a static initialization vector, which can be easily predicted by an attacker, allowing them to decrypt the ciphertext.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date encryption algorithm, such as 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding' or 'AES/GCM/NoPadding'."
