        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used for encryption (AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding) is not secure. ECB mode does not use an initialization vector, which can lead to identical plaintext blocks being encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks. This can be exploited by an attacker to reveal sensitive information.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure encryption mode such as CBC, GCM, or CCM instead of ECB mode. Also, use a more secure key generation algorithm such as AES-256 instead of AES-128."
