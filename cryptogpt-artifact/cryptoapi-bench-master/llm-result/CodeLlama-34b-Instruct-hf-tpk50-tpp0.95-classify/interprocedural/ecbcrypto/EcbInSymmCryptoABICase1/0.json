        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto)",
        "description": "The cipher algorithm used is ECB, which is not a secure mode of operation. ECB encryption mode does not use an Initialization Vector (IV) to initialize the cipher, which makes it vulnerable to attacks that involve encrypting the same plaintext multiple times. In addition, ECB encryption mode does not hide the pattern of the plaintext, which can make it easier to deduce the contents of the encrypted data.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, or CTR, and use a random IV for each encryption operation."

        "description": "The KeyGenerator.generateKey() method generates a key using a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that may not be secure. The PRNG may be predictable, which could allow an attacker to deduce the contents of the encrypted data.",
