        "description": "The encryption key is generated using the `SecureRandom` class, but it is only 16 bytes long, which is not considered secure for AES encryption. A longer key should be used to ensure adequate encryption strength.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a longer encryption key using `SecureRandom` or use a password-based key derivation function (PBKDF) to stretch the key."
