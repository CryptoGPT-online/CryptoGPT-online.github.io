"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");",
"description": "The encryption algorithm used is AES, which is a widely used and considered secure algorithm. However, the key size used is only 16 bytes, which is too small to provide adequate security. According to the NIST recommendations, the minimum key size for AES should be 128 bits (16 bytes). Using a smaller key size can make the encryption easier to break.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key size for the encryption algorithm. In this case, using a key size of at least 128 bits (16 bytes) would provide sufficient security."
