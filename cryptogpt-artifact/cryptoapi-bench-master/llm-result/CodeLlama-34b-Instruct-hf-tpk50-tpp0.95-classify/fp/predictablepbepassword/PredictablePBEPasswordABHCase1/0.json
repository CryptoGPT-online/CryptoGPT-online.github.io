 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.key(byte [] keyBytes)",
"description": "The 'P1.key' method uses a weak iteration count of 11010, which can be easily brute-forced by an attacker. It also uses a static password and salt, which can be easily extracted by an attacker and used to compromise the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a more secure value, such as 20000 or higher. Use a random password and salt for each encryption, and store them securely."
