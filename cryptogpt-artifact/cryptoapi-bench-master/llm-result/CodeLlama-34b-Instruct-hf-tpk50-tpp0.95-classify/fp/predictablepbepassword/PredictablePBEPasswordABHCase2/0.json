{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
"description": "The iteration count of 11010 is low, which makes the encryption weak and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 100,000 or more, to increase the encryption strength."

"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = new byte[16];",
"description": "The salt used for the encryption is too short, which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a longer salt, such as 32 bytes or more, to make the encryption stronger."
