[
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom(new byte[]{b})",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a byte array that is derived from a hardcoded value. This is a risk of using a weak random number generator, which can be predicted by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator, such as SecureRandom or Random, and avoid using hardcoded values."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] seed = str.getBytes();",
"description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom class is derived from a hardcoded string. This is a risk of using hardcoded credentials, which can be easily reverse-engineered by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded credentials and instead use a secure method of generating a seed, such as using a secure random number generator."
