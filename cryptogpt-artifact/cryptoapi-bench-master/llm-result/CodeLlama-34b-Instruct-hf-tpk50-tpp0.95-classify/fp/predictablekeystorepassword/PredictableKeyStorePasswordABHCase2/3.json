"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String key = hm.get(\"aaa\");",
"description": "The password is hardcoded and can be easily discovered by reverse engineering the code.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure method to store and retrieve the password, such as a secure database or an encrypted file."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
"description": "The KeyStore is using a weak encryption algorithm to store the password, which can be easily brute-forced.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure encryption algorithm with a strong key size and a high iteration count, such as AES with a 256-bit key and an iteration count of at least 100,000."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
"description": "The URL for the KeyStore is not properly validated, which can allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept the request and replace the KeyStore with a malicious one.",
"recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation using a trusted certificate authority, such as the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)."
