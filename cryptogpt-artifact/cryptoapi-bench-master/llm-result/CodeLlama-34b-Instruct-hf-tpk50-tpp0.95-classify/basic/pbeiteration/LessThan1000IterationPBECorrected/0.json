{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
"description": "The use of a static password salt in a PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm is vulnerable to attack as it allows an attacker to easily guess the password by simply iterating through the possible passwords and re-encrypting them with the known salt.",
"recommendation": "Use a randomly generated salt each time a password is encrypted, and store it securely."
