"description": "The provided code uses RSA algorithm for generating a key pair, which is known to be vulnerable to attacks like frequency analysis, and is not recommended for use. Instead, use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) or symmetric key cryptography for better security.",
"recommendation": "Replace RSA with ECC or symmetric key cryptography."
