"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
"description": "The code uses the default SSL socket factory, which may not be secure. It's recommended to specify the SSL protocol version and cipher suites explicitly.",
"recommendation": "Use SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\") to create an SSL context with the desired protocol version and cipher suites, and then use the getSocketFactory() method to get the socket factory."
