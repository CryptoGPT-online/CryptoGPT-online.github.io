"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();\nint x = randomGenerator.nextInt();",
"description": "The use of the `Random` class to generate random numbers is not secure. It relies on the system clock and the seed value, which can be predictable, leading to the generation of predictable random numbers.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, such as `SecureRandom`, to generate truly random numbers."
