        "description": "The use of the \"RC2\" algorithm is considered to be broken and should not be used for encryption purposes. It has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks and should be avoided in favor of more secure algorithms such as AES.",
        "recommendation": "Change the algorithm used in the code to a secure one such as AES. For example, \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" is a secure algorithm that can be used for encryption purposes."
