 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance('IDEA')",
"description": "The use of the IDEA algorithm is considered insecure because it uses a relatively small key size of 128 bits, which is not sufficient to provide adequate security against brute force attacks. Additionally, IDEA is a symmetric-key block cipher, which means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it vulnerable to attacks such as the meet-in-the-middle attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES with a larger key size, and use a different key for encryption and decryption."
