{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
"description": "The key generator is using the \"AES\" algorithm, which is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. It is not recommended to use this algorithm as it is vulnerable to attacks such as brute force and side-channel attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure and recommended algorithm such as AES-GCM, AES-CTR, or AES-CBC with a secure mode of operation such as CBC-CTR or GCM-SIV."
