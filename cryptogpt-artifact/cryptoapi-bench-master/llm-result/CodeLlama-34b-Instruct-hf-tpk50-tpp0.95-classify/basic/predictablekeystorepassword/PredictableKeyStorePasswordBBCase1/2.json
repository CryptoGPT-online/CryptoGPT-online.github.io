        "description": "The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm can weaken the security of the system. The provided code uses the `JKS` type, which is considered broken, and should be replaced with a more secure algorithm, such as `PKCS12` or `BC`.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the `JKS` type with a more secure algorithm, such as `PKCS12` or `BC`, and update the `go()` method to use the new algorithm."

        "description": "Hardcoding credentials in the code can lead to security vulnerabilities, as the credentials can be easily extracted and used by attackers. The provided code hardcodes the default key as \"changeit\", which can be easily extracted and used to gain unauthorized access to the system.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded default key and replace it with a secure credential management system, such as a password vault or a secure key store."

        "description": "Improper certificate validation can lead to security vulnerabilities, as attackers can use malicious or invalid certificates to gain unauthorized access to the system. The provided code uses the `URL` class to load the certificate, but does not perform any validation checks, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the `URL` class with a secure certificate validation mechanism, such as the `CertificateFactory` class, and perform proper certificate validation checks."
