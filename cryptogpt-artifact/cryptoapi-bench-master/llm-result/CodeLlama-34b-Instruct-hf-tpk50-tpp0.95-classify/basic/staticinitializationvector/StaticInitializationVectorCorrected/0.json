        "description": "The code generates a hardcoded AES key, which is not secure. In this example, the key is generated on the client-side, which is not secure as the client-side code can be easily reverse-engineered.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the key should be generated on the server-side and provided to the client-side through a secure channel, such as SSL/TLS. Additionally, the key should be kept secure on the server-side, such as by encrypting it with a secure password or by storing it in a secure location."

        "description": "The code generates an IV (Initialization Vector) for the AES encryption using a `SecureRandom` instance. However, the `SecureRandom` instance is initialized with the current time, which is not a secure way to generate random values. An attacker can potentially predict the IV and compromise the encryption.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the IV should be generated using a secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom` in Java. Additionally, the IV should be kept secret and not shared with anyone."
