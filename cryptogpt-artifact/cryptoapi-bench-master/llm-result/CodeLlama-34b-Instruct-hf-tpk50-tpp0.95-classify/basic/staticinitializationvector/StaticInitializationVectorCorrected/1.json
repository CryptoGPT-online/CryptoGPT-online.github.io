        "description": "The code uses the `AES` algorithm, which is a broken algorithm and should not be used for any purpose. It is vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be easily cracked.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as `AES-GCM` or `AES-CTR` instead. Also, use a secure and random key for encryption, do not use a static key."

        "description": "The code uses hardcoded credentials for encryption, which is a security vulnerability. Hardcoded credentials can be easily extracted from the code and used to encrypt data.",
        "recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials for encryption. Instead, use a secure and random key for encryption, and store the key securely."
