 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", 
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
"description": "The use of \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" is a vulnerable algorithm as it uses a static IV, which can be easily predicted by an attacker.", 
"recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm, such as \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\" or \"AES/CCM/NoPadding\" instead."}
