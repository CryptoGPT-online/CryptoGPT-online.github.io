 {"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec(defaultKey,salt,iterationCount,keyLength)",
"description": "The code uses a PBEKeySpec with a low iteration count (11010) and a small key length (16). This can make the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Consider increasing the iteration count and key length to make the encryption more secure."}
