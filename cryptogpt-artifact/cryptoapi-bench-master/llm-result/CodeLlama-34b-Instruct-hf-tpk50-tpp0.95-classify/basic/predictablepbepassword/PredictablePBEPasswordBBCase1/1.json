 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.key()",
"description": "The key generation function uses a low iteration count (11010) and a short key length (16 bytes) which makes the encryption weak. ",
"recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count (at least 100000) and a longer key length (at least 32 bytes) to make the encryption more secure. Additionally, using a proper password-based key derivation function (PBKDF) such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt is recommended."
