 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\")",
"description": "The MD2 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collisions, which can lead to the compromise of data integrity and authentication.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD2."
