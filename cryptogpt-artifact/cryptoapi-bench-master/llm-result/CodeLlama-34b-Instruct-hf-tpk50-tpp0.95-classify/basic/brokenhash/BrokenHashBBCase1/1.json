"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
"description": "The SHA-1 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for secure applications. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which can allow an attacker to generate a message with the same hash value as a given message, without knowing the original message. This can be used to compromise the integrity of data or the authenticity of a message.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of SHA-1."
