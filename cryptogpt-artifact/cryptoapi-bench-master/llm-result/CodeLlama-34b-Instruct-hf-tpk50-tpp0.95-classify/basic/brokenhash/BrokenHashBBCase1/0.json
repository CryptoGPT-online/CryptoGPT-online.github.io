 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
"description": "The use of SHA1 as a cryptographic hash algorithm is considered insecure and should not be used in new code. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions, which can lead to critical security issues.",
"recommendation": "Replace SHA1 with a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA256 or SHA512. If SHA1 is required for compatibility reasons, make sure to mitigate the risks associated with its use."}
