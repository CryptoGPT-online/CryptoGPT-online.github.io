"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")",
"description": "The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm can lead to vulnerabilities in the code, such as the potential for hash collision or preimage attacks. In this case, the algorithm \"SHA-256\" is considered secure, but using a weaker algorithm such as \"SHA-1\" or \"MD5\" would be a misuse.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and robust algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 for cryptographic hash functions."
