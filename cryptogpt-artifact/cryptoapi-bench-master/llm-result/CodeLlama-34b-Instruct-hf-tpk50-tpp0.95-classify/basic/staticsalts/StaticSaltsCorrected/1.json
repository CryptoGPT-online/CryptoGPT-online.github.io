"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
"description": "The iteration count used in the PBE parameter specification is low, which can lead to weak encryption and vulnerability to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 10000 or more, to ensure adequate encryption strength."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32]",
"description": "The salt used in the PBE parameter specification is not randomly generated, which can lead to vulnerabilities in the encryption process.",
"recommendation": "Use a securely generated salt, such as the `SecureRandom` class in Java, to ensure that the salt is unpredictable."
