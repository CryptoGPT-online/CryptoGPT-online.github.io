        "description": "The iteration count used in the password-based encryption (PBE) is too low. The recommended minimum number of iterations is 10,000, and the maximum number of iterations is 30,000. Using a lower number of iterations makes it easier for attackers to perform brute-force attacks on the encrypted data.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 10,000, and ideally above 30,000."
