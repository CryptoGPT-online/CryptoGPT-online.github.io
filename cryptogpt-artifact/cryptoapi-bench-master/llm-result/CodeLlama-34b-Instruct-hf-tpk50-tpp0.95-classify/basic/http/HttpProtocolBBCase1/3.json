"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
"description": "The URL class in Java uses the MD2 hash algorithm, which is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. It should not be used for any purpose, and it is not secure to use it for encrypting URLs.",
"recommendation": "Do not use the URL class for encrypting URLs. Instead, use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA, and make sure to use it correctly and securely."
