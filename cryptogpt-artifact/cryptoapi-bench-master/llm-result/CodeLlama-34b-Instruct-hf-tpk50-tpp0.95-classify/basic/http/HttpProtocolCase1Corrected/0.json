"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
"description": "The code uses the URL class to create a URL object, but the URL class uses the MD2 algorithm for hashing, which is considered broken and should not be used. Instead, a secure hash function such as SHA-256 should be used.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure hash function such as SHA-256 to create the hash for the URL."
