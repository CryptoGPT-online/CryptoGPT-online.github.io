        "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
        "description": "The `URL` constructor uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, specifically the MD5 hash algorithm, which is known to be weak and should not be used in new code. Instead, use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256.",
        "recommendation": "Replace `new URL(url)` with `new URL(url, 42)` to use a secure hash algorithm. Additionally, consider using the `HttpUrlConnection` class instead of the `URL` class to make HTTP requests, as it provides more control over the SSL/TLS handshake."
