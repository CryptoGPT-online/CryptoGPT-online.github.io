        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "go(url)",
        "description": "The `go` method uses the `new URL` method to create a URL object, but the `new URL` method does not verify the validity of the URL. This can lead to the creation of a URL object that represents an invalid or malicious URL, which could potentially be used to launch a phishing attack or other types of attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to create the URL object, such as the `java.net.URL` constructor or the `java.net.URI` class."
