    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;",
    "description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is not truly random and may be predictable by an attacker. This can compromise the randomness of the generated numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure source of randomness, such as /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems, to initialize the SecureRandom instance."
