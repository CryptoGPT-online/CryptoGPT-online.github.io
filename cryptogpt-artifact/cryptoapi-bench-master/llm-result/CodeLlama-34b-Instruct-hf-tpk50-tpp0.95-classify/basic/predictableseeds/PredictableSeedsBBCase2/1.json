Note that the `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random numbers, but the seed value is always the same (100). This can lead to predictable random number generation, which is a security issue. To fix this misuse, you should use a high-entropy seed value, such as a secure random number generated using `SecureRandom.generateSeed(int numBytes)`.
