"description": "The use of a deterministic seed to initialize the SecureRandom instance allows an attacker to predict the generated random values.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator with a strong seed, such as SecureRandom with a high-entropy seed, and avoid using any user-input as the seed."
