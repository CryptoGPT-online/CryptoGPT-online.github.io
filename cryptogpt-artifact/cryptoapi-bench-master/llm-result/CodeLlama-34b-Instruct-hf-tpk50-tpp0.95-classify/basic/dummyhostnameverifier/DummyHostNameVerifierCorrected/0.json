        "description": "The code checks if the hostname is equal to a specific IP address, which is a hardcoded value. This is an insecure way of verifying the authenticity of a certificate, as it bypasses the normal certificate validation process.",
        "recommendation": "Use the standard Java API for certificate validation, such as `CertificateFactory.getInstance().generateCertificate()` to validate the certificate against a trusted root certificate."
