        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "hostname.equals(\"192.168.0.10\")",
        "description": "The `verify` method only checks if the hostname matches a specific IP address (192.168.0.10), but it does not verify the certificate or perform any other validation checks. This means that an attacker could potentially use a malicious certificate and still be able to connect to the server.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation mechanism, such as the `javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier` class, to verify the certificate and hostname before establishing a connection."
