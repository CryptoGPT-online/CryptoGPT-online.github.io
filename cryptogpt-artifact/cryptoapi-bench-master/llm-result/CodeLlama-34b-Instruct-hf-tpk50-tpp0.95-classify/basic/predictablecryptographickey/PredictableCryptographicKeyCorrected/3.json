 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\")", "description": "The use of AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING mode in this code is not recommended because it is vulnerable to attacks such as padding oracle attacks. Instead, AES/GCM/NoPadding should be used.", "recommendation": "Replace the line with cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\")"}
