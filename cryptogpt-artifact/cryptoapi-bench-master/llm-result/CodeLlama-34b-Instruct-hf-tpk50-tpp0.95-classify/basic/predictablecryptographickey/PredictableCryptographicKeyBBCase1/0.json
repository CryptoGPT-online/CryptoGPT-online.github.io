"description": "The provided key is derived from a hardcoded string, which is a weak key and can be easily guessed. A key should be chosen randomly and with a sufficient length, e.g. 16 bytes for AES.
The `getBytes()` method is not guaranteed to return the same bytes every time it is called, as it depends on the default platform encoding.
The `copyOf` method is used to truncate the key to a fixed length of 16 bytes, which may result in a weak key if the original key was longer than 16 bytes.
AES is a widely used block cipher, but it is not appropriate for use in new systems, as it has been shown to be vulnerable to side-channel attacks. A modern and secure symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 should be used instead.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a random key of sufficient length, e.g. 16 bytes for AES.
Use a modern and secure symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
