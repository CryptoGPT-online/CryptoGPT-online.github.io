        "vulnerable_code": "The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods do not perform any validation on the provided certificates.",
        "description": "The `X509TrustManager` interface specifies that the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods should validate the provided certificates. However, the implementation in this class does not perform any validation, which means that it will trust any certificate without verifying its authenticity.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods, such as checking the certificate's validity period, revocation status, and issuer."
