 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\")",
"description": "The use of the MD2 algorithm is vulnerable to collision attacks, which can allow an attacker to create two different inputs that produce the same hash output. This can lead to exploitation in scenarios such as hash-based authentication, digital signatures, and message integrity checking.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the MD2 algorithm with a more secure alternative, such as SHA-256 or SHA-384."
