        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\")",
        "description": "The use of MD2, a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm, is a serious vulnerability. MD2 has been proven to be vulnerable to collision attacks, which can lead to the manipulation of digital signatures and the spread of malware.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256, which is currently considered to be secure. Also, use a more secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or argon2, to store the password securely."
