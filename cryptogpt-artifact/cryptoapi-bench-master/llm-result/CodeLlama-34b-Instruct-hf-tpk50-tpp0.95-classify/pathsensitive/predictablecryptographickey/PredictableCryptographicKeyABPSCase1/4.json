 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm with a static key, which is a well-known and widely used algorithm, but it is not secure to use a static key, as it can be easily guessed or deduced by an attacker. Also, the key is not randomized, which makes it even more vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "The code should use a random key, generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, and should also use a more secure algorithm, such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR, which are resistant to attacks such as padding oracle attacks."
