"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
"description": "The key length is hardcoded to 16 bytes, which is not secure enough for modern cryptographic algorithms.",
"recommendation": "Use a higher key length, such as 32 bytes, and use a secure random number generator to generate the key."
