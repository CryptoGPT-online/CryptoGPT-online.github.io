"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr2 = new SecureRandom();\n        int choice = 2;\n        byte[] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};\n        if (choice > 1)\n            sr2.nextBytes(seed);",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers for cryptographic purposes. However, the way the SecureRandom class is initialized in the vulnerable code is not secure. The SecureRandom class is initialized using a predictable seed, which can be easily guessed. This makes it possible for an attacker to predict the generated random numbers, which can lead to serious security issues.",
"recommendation": "To fix the misuse, you should initialize the SecureRandom class with a secure and unpredictable seed. You can do this by using a secure random number generator, such as the Java SecureRandom class, to generate the seed. You can also use a more secure and less predictable seed, such as a random number generated by a hardware random number generator."
