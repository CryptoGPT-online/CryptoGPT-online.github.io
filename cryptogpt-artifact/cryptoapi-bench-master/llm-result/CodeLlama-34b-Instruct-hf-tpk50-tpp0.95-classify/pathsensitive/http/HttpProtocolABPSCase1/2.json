"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
"description": "The use of the `new URL(url)` constructor without validating the URL is a potential security vulnerability. The `URL` class does not validate the URL before attempting to construct it, which means that it is possible for an attacker to provide a malicious URL that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the `URL` class.",
"recommendation": "Use the `URL` class with caution and validate the URL before passing it to the constructor."
