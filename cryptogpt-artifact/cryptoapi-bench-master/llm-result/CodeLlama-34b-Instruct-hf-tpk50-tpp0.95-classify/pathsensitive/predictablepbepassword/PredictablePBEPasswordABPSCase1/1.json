{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.key(int choice)",
"description": "The key generation algorithm used in the code is insecure. The `SecureRandom` class is not appropriate for generating cryptographic keys, as it is designed for generating random numbers for other purposes. A more secure algorithm, such as the `KeyGenerator` class, should be used instead.",
"recommendation": "Replace the `SecureRandom` class with a more secure algorithm, such as the `KeyGenerator` class, and follow secure key generation practices, such as using a secure random number generator and a strong password or passphrase."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"saagar\"",
"description": "The password used to generate the key is hardcoded and can be easily obtained by an attacker. This makes it possible for an attacker to compromise the security of the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded password and prompt the user to enter a password or passphrase instead. This ensures that the password is not stored in plaintext and is not accessible to an attacker."
