        "description": "The number of iterations used for the key derivation function is too low, which reduces the encryption strength and makes it easier for attackers to crack the password.",
        "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 10000 or more, to make the encryption strength more robust."

        "description": "The algorithm used for key derivation is selected based on user input, which can be exploited by an attacker to downgrade the encryption to a less secure algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm, such as PBKDF2, for key derivation and avoid selecting the algorithm based on user input."
