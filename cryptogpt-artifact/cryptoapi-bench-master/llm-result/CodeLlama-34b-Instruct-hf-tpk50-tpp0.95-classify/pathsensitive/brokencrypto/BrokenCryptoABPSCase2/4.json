"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish\")",
"description": "The application uses the Blowfish algorithm, which is considered to be insecure and should not be used for new applications. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the Blowfish algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as AES."

{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
"description": "The application uses a KeyGenerator to generate a SecretKey, but does not provide any entropy to the KeyGenerator. This means that the generated key is not secure and may be predictable.",
"recommendation": "Add entropy to the KeyGenerator by using the `setSeed` method and provide a secure random source such as `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")`. Alternatively, use a secure key generation mechanism such as `KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/NoPadding\")`, which will generate a key securely and automatically."

{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)",
"description": "The application uses the AES algorithm, but does not specify a key size or iteration count. This means that the encryption strength is inadequate and may be easily broken by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Specify a key size and iteration count when initializing the cipher, such as `cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(iv), 128, 1024)`. This will improve the encryption strength and make it more secure."
