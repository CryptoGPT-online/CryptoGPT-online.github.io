 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "The code uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used. It also uses the ECB mode of operation, which is not semantically secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and modern encryption algorithm such as AES with a secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM, and use a secure padding scheme such as PKCS5Padding or PKCS7Padding."
