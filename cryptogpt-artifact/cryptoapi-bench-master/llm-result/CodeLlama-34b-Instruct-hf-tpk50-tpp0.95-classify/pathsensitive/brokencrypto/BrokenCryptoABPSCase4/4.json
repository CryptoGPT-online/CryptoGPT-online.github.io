        "description": "The use of RC2 encryption algorithm is insecure and should be avoided due to its relatively short key length and vulnerability to attacks such as collision attacks and differential attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a larger key length (e.g. 256-bit) and a stronger padding scheme (e.g. PKCS#7) instead."
