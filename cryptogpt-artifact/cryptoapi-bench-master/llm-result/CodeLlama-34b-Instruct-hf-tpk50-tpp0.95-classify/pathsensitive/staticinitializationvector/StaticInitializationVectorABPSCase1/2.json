{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
"description": "The code uses a hardcoded initialization vector (IV) for encryption, which reduces the strength of the encryption and makes it vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a randomly generated IV for each encryption operation, and store the IV with the encrypted data. This ensures that each encryption operation uses a unique and unpredictable IV, making it more resistant to attacks."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
"description": "The code uses the default constructor for SecureRandom, which may not be cryptographically strong enough for some use cases. Using the default constructor can lead to the generation of predictable random numbers, which can compromise the security of the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), instead of the default constructor. This ensures that the random numbers used for encryption are unpredictable and resistant to attacks."
