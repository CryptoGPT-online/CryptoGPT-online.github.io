    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\")",
    "description": "The RSA algorithm used in this code is vulnerable to a number of attacks, including the recent attacks on the NSA's Suite B recommendations. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm, such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) or a symmetric key algorithm like AES.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the RSA algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as ECC or AES."
