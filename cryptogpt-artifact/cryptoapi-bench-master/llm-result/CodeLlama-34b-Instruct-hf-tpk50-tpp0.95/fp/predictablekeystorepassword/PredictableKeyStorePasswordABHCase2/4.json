"description": "Using a broken crypto algorithm, such as JKS, is a vulnerability as it can be easily exploited by attackers. The JKS algorithm is known to be weak and should not be used in production environments.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date crypto algorithm, such as Bouncy Castle, instead of JKS."
