"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate cryptographically strong random numbers, but in this code, it is being used with a predictable seed. This can make it easier for an attacker to guess the random numbers generated by the `SecureRandom` instance.",
"recommendation": "Replace the `SecureRandom` class with a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`."
