"vulnerable_code": "hm.put(\"bbb\", new Integer(20));",
"description": "The code uses the `PBEParameterSpec` constructor with the iteration count as the second argument. This allows an attacker to specify a very low iteration count, making it easier for them to perform a brute-force attack on the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and random iteration count for the PBEParameterSpec constructor, such as the recommended value of at least 10,000 iterations. Additionally, use a secure random number generator to generate the salt."
