"misuse": "Insecure Use of Crypto API",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "The code uses the Cipher.getInstance() method to create an instance of the AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm, but it does not specify a secure mode of operation. This can lead to weaknesses in the encryption, such as the ability to perform plaintext recovery attacks.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the code should specify a secure mode of operation when creating the Cipher instance. For example, the code could use the Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\", \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding+PBKDF2\") method to create an instance of the AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm with a secure mode of operation."
