"description": "The AES algorithm is being used in ECB mode, which is not secure. ECB mode does not provide semantic security, meaning that if the same block is encrypted twice, the resulting ciphertext blocks will be the same.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cipher mode, such as CBC or GCM mode, to provide both confidentiality and integrity."
