"vulnerable_code": "key.getBytes()",
"description": "The code uses the getBytes() method to convert the key to a byte array, which can cause the key to be encoded in a platform-specific way, potentially leading to interoperability issues.",
"recommendation": "Use a standardized key derivation function such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt to derive the key from a passphrase or other input."

"vulnerable_code": "new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\")",
"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm for encryption, which is a widely used and well-studied algorithm, but it can still be vulnerable to attacks such as side-channel attacks or implementation flaws.",
"recommendation": "Consider using a more modern and secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
