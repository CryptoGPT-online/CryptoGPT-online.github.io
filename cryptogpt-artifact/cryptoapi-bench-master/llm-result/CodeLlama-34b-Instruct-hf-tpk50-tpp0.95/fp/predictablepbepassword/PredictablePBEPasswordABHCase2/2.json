        "description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec with a weak iteration count (11010) and a small key length (16). This can lead to vulnerabilities such as brute-force attacks and side-channel attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count and key length to improve the security of the encryption. It's also recommended to use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256, instead of the current hash function."
