"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");",
"description": "The code uses the RSA algorithm to perform encryption and decryption, but the RSA algorithm is not suitable for encryption and decryption operations. It should be used for key exchange and digital signatures only.",
"recommendation": "Use a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES for encryption and decryption operations. Use an asymmetric encryption algorithm such as RSA for key exchange and digital signatures."
