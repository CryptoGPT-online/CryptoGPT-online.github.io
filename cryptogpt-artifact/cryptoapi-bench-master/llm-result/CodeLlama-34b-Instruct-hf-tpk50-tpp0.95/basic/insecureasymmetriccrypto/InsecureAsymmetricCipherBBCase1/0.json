 Here is the JSON response:
{
"misuse": "Weak Key Generation",
"vulnerable_code": "keySize = 1024",
"description": "Using a weak key size (1024 bits) for RSA encryption",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 2048 or 4096 bits"
}

This response indicates that the code is using a weak key size (1024 bits) for RSA encryption, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks. The recommendation is to use a stronger key size, such as 2048 or 4096 bits, which are more secure and resistant to attacks.
