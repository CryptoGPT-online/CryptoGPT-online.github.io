"misuse": "Bypassing SSL/TLS Hostname Verification",
"vulnerable_code": "return true;",
"description": "The code always returns true, allowing any hostname to be accepted without proper verification. This can lead to Man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the server and impersonates the server to the client.",
"recommendation": "Use the default hostname verifier provided by the SSL/TLS implementation, or implement a custom hostname verifier that properly verifies the hostname against a known list of trusted hostnames."
