"description": "This code is vulnerable to hostname verification bypass. The `verify()` method is called with a default `HostnameVerifier` which may not be secure. Attackers can use this vulnerability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and steal sensitive information.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure `HostnameVerifier` implementation, such as the one provided by `SSLContext`. Alternatively, you can use a `HostnameVerifier` that checks the hostname against a predefined list of trusted hosts."
