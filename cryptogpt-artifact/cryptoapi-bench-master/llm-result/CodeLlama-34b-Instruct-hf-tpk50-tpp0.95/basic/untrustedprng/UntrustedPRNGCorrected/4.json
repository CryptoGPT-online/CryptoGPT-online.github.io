It is not suitable for generating keys, nonces, or other security-sensitive data. The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provides a variety of cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators, such as the SHA1PRNG, which should be used for these purposes.",

"description": "The SecureRandom class provides a method for generating pseudo-random numbers, but it does not provide a mechanism for generating random numbers with sufficient entropy. Insufficient entropy can make it easier for an attacker to predict the next random number generated, which can compromise the security of the application. To address this, the JCE provides a number of random number generators with higher entropy, such as the SHA1PRNG, which should be used in place of the SecureRandom class.",
