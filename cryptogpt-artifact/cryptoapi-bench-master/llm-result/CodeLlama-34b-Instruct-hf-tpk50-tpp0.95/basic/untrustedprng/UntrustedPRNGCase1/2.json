"description": "The use of Random class in Java is not cryptographically secure, it is not suitable for generating random numbers for cryptographic purposes such as key generation, nonce generation, or randomized encryption. The reason is that the Random class is not designed to produce high-quality randomness, and it may produce predictable numbers. For example, if the seed is not properly set, the same sequence of random numbers may be produced every time the program is run.",
"recommendation": "To generate cryptographically secure random numbers, use SecureRandom class instead. SecureRandom class is designed to produce high-quality randomness and it uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG). It also allows to set the seed, so the sequence of random numbers is unpredictable."
