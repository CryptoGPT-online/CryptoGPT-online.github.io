"description": "The use of Random() class in Java for cryptographic purposes is considered broken and should not be used. It uses a pseudo-random number generator that is not designed for security purposes. It may generate predictable or biased random numbers, which can be exploited by attackers.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic random number generator, such as SecureRandom, instead. SecureRandom uses a cryptographically secure algorithm to generate random numbers, making it more suitable for cryptographic purposes."
