"description": "The Random class is not suitable for cryptographic use cases. It is designed for generating random numbers for statistical purposes, not for generating random numbers that are suitable for cryptography. Using Random in a cryptographic context can lead to weak keys and insecure encryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, instead of Random. SecureRandom is designed specifically for cryptographic use cases and produces random numbers that are suitable for secure encryption."
