"description": "Using the default SSL/TLS implementation in Java may result in the use of weak or broken cryptographic algorithms, which can make the connection vulnerable to attacks such as eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure SSL/TLS implementation, such as the Bouncy Castle library or the OpenJDK implementation, and configure it to use strong cryptographic algorithms."
