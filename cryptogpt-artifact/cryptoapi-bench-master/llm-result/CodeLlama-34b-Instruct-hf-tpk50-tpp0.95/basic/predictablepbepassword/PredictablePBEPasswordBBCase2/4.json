"description": "The key derivation function used by the PBEKeySpec class is vulnerable to brute force attacks. The PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 algorithm is recommended instead.",
"recommendation": "Replace the PBEKeySpec class with the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 algorithm, and use a larger iteration count to increase the computational cost of the attack."
