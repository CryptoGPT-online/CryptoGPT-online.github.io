"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P2 class",
"description": "The code uses the outdated Password-Based Encryption (PBE) algorithm, which is no longer considered secure. The algorithm was deprecated in 2011 and should not be used for any new development. The PBE algorithm is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and can be easily cracked.",
"recommendation": "Replace the PBE algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as AES-GCM, AES-CTR, or AES-CBC. Additionally, consider using a key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to derive the encryption key from the password."
