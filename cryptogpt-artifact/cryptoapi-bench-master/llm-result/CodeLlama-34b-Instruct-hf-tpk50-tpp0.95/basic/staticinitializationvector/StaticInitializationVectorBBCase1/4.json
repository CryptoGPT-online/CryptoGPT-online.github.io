"description": "The initialization vector (IV) used by the cipher is derived from a weak random number generator, which can lead to predictable patterns and reduce the security of the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator, such as SecureRandom or ThreadLocalRandom, to generate the IV. This will increase the security of the encryption by making the IV more unpredictable."
