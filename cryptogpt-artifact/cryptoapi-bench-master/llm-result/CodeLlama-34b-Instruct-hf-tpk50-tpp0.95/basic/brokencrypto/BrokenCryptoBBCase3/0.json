"description": "The use of the RC4 algorithm is known to be insecure. It has been vulnerable to attacks since the 1990s, and is considered to be unsuitable for use in any new code. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, instead.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the RC4 algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as AES. For example, you could use the AES algorithm by changing the line to `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");`."
