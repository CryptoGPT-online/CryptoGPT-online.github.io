"description": "The code uses the insecure RC4 algorithm for key generation and encryption/decryption. RC4 is a weak stream cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. It should not be used in new code and should be replaced with a more secure algorithm such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the usage of RC4 with a more secure algorithm such as AES."
