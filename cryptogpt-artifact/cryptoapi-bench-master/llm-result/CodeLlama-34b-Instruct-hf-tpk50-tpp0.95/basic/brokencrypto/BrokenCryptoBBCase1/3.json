"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\")",
"description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for encryption. It is vulnerable to attacks such as block encryption and key recovery attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm such as AES or ChaCha20 instead."
