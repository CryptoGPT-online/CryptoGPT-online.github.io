"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
"description": "The use of the RC2 algorithm is insecure and should not be used. It is a 64-bit block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Switch to a more secure cipher such as AES, and use a higher block size such as 128 or 256 bits."
