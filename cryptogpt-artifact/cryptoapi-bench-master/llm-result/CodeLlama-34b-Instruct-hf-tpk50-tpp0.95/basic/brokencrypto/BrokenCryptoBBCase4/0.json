"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\")",
"description": "The use of RC2 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for encryption. It has been shown to be vulnerable to various attacks, including differential and linear cryptanalysis.",
"recommendation": "Replace RC2 with a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES."

"vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)",
"description": "The initialization vector (IV) used for encryption is not properly generated and may not be random. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as ciphertext reuse and IV fixed atacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a properly generated and randomized IV for encryption, and ensure that it is unique for each encryption operation."
