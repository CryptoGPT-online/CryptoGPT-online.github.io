"misuse": "Insufficient Randomness",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
"description": "The random salt is generated using the Java SecureRandom class, which is not suitable for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. The size of the salt is also too small, which can make it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force the encryption key.",
"recommendation": "Use a proper cryptographic random number generator, such as the Java `SecureRandom` class, to generate the salt. Increase the size of the salt to at least 128 bits to make it more resistant to brute-force attacks."
