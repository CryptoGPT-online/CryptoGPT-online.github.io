        "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
        "description": "The 'PBEParameterSpec' class is a vulnerable algorithm that can be attacked using a dictionary attack or brute force attack. The 'count' parameter is too low, which reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm and makes it easier to attack.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger, more secure algorithm, such as 'PBKDF2' or 'scrypt'. Increase the value of the 'count' parameter to a much higher value, such as 100000 or more. Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator to generate the salt."
