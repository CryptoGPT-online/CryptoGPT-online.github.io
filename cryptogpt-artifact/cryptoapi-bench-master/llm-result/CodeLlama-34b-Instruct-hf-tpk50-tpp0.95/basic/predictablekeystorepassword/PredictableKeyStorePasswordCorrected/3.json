"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyStore.getInstance(type)",
"description": "The method KeyStore.getInstance(type) is used to get an instance of KeyStore, but the type parameter is not validated, which allows an attacker to specify a custom KeyStore implementation that could contain a backdoor. This could be used to steal sensitive data or gain unauthorized access to the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a specific KeyStore implementation, such as JKS or PKCS12, and validate the type parameter to ensure that it matches the expected implementation."

"misuse": "Insufficient Randomness",
"vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
"description": "The method String.valueOf(random.ints()) is used to generate a random string, but the Random class is not properly seeded, which could lead to predictable random numbers and potentially weak passwords.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate strong passwords."

"misuse": "Hardcoded Secrets",
"vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\")",
"description": "The URL \"https://www.google.com\" is hardcoded in the code, which could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as API keys or other secrets.",
"recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding secrets in the code and instead use environment variables or configuration files to store and manage sensitive information."
