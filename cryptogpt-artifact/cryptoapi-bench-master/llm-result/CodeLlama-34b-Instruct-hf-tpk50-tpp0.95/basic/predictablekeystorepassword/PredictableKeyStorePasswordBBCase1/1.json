 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());", "description": "Using a broken or vulnerable crypto algorithm can lead to weak encryption and potential attack vulnerabilities. In this case, the code is using the JKS (Java KeyStore) format, which has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks such as the Logjam attack. The JKS format uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which has been shown to be insecure.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure crypto algorithm, such as the PKCS12 (Public-Key Cryptography Standards #12) format, which is not vulnerable to attacks such as the Logjam attack."}
