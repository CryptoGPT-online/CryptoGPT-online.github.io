"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());",
"description": "The code is using a broken crypto algorithm, specifically the JKS key store, which is vulnerable to attacks such as the Java Crypto API flaw. The JKS key store uses a proprietary format that is not standardized, and it has been found to be vulnerable to various attacks, such as padding oracle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Replace the JKS key store with a more secure key store such as PKCS#12 or JCEKS. Additionally, make sure to use the latest version of the Java Crypto API and keep the software up to date with the latest security patches."
