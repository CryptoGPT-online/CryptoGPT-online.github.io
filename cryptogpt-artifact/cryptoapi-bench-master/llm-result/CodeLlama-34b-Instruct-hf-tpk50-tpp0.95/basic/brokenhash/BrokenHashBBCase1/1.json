 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
"description": "SHA1 is a broken hash algorithm and should not be used for any cryptographic purposes. It can be easily broken by collisions and preimages, and it has been deprecated by NIST. Instead, use a more secure hash algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
"recommendation": "Replace `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")` with `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")` or `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-512\")`. Be sure to also use a secure random number generator to generate the salt and IV, and to properly handle the padding of the input data."}
