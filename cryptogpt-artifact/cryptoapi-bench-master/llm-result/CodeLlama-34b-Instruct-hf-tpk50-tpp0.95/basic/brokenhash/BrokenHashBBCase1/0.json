"description": "The use of SHA1 hash algorithm is considered broken and should be avoided. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions, which can lead to attacks such as preimage attack and second preimage attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger hashing algorithm such as SHA256 or SHA512 instead of SHA1."
