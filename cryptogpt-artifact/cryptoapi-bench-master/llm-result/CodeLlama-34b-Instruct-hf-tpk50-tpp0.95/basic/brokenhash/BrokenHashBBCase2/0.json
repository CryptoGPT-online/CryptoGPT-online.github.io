"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
"description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for secure applications. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, making it possible for an attacker to create two different inputs with the same MD5 hash.",
"recommendation": "Replace the MD5 algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. Consider using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) for generating random numbers instead of the broken Random class."
