"description": "The code uses the insecure MD5 hash algorithm which is vulnerable to collision attacks. It should be replaced with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
"recommendation": "Replace the line `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");` with `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");`"
