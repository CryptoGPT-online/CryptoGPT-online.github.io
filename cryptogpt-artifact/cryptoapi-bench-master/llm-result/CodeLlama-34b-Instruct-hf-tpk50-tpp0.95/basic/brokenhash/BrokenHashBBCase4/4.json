"description": "The MD2 algorithm is a cryptographically broken hash function that is not considered secure. It was found to have a weak collision resistance, which makes it vulnerable to collisions attacks. It's recommended to use a secure and cryptographically strong hash function instead, such as SHA-256.",
"recommendation": "Replace the usage of MD2 with a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256."
