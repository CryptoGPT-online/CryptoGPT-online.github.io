"description": "The MD2 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collisions, which can lead to potential attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, instead of MD2."

"vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(md.digest())",
"description": "The digest() method of the MessageDigest class returns a byte array that represents the computed hash value. It is not intended to be printed directly to the console. Instead, it should be converted to a hexadecimal string representation, which can be done using the toHexString() method of the DatatypeConverter class.",
"recommendation": "Use the toHexString() method of the DatatypeConverter class to convert the byte array to a hexadecimal string representation."
