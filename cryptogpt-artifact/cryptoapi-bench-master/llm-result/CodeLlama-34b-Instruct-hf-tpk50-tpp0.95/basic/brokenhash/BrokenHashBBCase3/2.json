"description": "The use of MD4 as a cryptographic hash function is not recommended, as it has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions. A collision attack can allow an attacker to find two different inputs that produce the same output hash value.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead."
