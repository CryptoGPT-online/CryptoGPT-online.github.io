"misuse": "Insecure Use of AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm in ECB mode and PKCS5 padding, which is insecure and can lead to plaintext recovery attacks. ECB mode does not provide semantic security, meaning that the same plaintext will always produce the same ciphertext, regardless of the key used. This makes it possible for an attacker to deduce information about the plaintext based on the ciphertext. Additionally, PKCS5 padding is not recommended as it can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure mode of operation, such as GCM or CBC, and a secure padding scheme, such as OAEP or RSA-KEM."
