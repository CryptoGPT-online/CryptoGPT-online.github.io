"description": "The cipher instance is using AES in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which is a vulnerable configuration. CBC mode is prone to padding oracle attacks, and PKCS5 padding does not provide enough security against these attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure encryption mode such as GCM or EAX, and use a secure padding scheme such as PKCS7."

"description": "The key generator is using the AES algorithm to generate a secret key, but the generated key is not being used securely. The key should be generated securely and stored securely.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key management system such as a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and store the key securely."
