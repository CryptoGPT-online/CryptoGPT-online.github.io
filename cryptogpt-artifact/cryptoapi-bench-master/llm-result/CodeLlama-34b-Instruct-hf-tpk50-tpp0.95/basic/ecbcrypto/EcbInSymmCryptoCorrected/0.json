 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", 
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "The code is using CBC mode with AES, which is not a secure cipher mode for encryption. In CBC mode, the encryption process is dependent on the randomness of the initialization vector. If the initialization vector is not properly generated or if it is reused, it can lead to a vulnerability known as the \"Ciphertext Indistinguishability\" attack. ",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cipher mode such as GCM or EAX. In addition, use a properly generated and unique initialization vector for each encryption process. It's also recommended to use a secure key management system to generate and store keys securely."}
