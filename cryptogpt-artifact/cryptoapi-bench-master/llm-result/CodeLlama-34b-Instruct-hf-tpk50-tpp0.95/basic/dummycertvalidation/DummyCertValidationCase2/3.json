"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "D2 implements X509TrustManager",
"description": "The class D2 implements X509TrustManager but does not properly verify the trust of the certificates. This can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can intercept and modify the traffic between the client and the server.",
"recommendation": "Implement proper certificate verification in the D2 class, using a robust crypto library such as Bouncy Castle. Additionally, ensure that the class is properly configured and updated with the latest CA certificates."
