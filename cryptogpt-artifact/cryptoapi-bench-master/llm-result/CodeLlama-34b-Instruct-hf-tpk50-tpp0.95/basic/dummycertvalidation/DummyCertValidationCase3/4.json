"misuse": "Insecure Trust Manager",
"vulnerable_code": "The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods are not implemented, allowing any certificate to be trusted.",
"description": "The `D3` class implements the `X509TrustManager` interface, which is responsible for managing trust in X.509 certificates. However, the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods are not implemented, which means that any certificate can be trusted without any validation. This is a security vulnerability as it allows man-in-the-middle attacks and other types of attacks where an attacker can present a fake certificate as legitimate.",
"recommendation": "Implement the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods to properly validate the trust of X.509 certificates. Use a secure trust store to ensure that only valid certificates are trusted."
