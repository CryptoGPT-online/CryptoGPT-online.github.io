        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "D3 implements X509TrustManager",
        "description": "D3 implements X509TrustManager, which means that it is trusting any certificate that is presented to it without verifying its authenticity. This is a serious vulnerability because it allows an attacker to inject malicious certificates and potentially gain access to sensitive data.",
        "recommendation": "Do not implement X509TrustManager without proper certificate verification. Consider using a trusted certificate authority, such as the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), to ensure that only trusted certificates are accepted."
    },

        "description": "The checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are not checking the validity of the certificates presented to them. This means that an attacker could potentially present a malicious certificate and gain access to sensitive data.",
        "recommendation": "Perform proper certificate validation in the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods. Consider using a trusted certificate authority, such as the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), to ensure that only trusted certificates are accepted."
