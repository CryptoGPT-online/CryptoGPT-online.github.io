"description": "The SecureRandom constructor that takes a byte array as a seed is broken because it does not use a cryptographically secure seed. The seed array is not guaranteed to be used in a cryptographically secure way, and the generated random number may not be secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure seed, such as a SecureRandom instance, or a securely generated seed, such as a random number from a secure random number generator."

"vulnerable_code": "sr.nextInt()",
"description": "The SecureRandom.nextInt() method generates a random number that may not be secure. It uses the default algorithm, which is a linear congruential algorithm, which is known to be weak and predictable.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generation algorithm, such as a cryptographic hash function or a secure random number generator, to generate random numbers."
