 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed})", "description": "Using a single byte as a seed for a secure random number generator (SRNG) is not a reliable way to generate secure random numbers. The seed can be guessed easily and the generated numbers can be predicted.", "recommendation": "Use a strong seed, such as a byte array with at least 32 bytes, to generate secure random numbers. Also, use a secure SRNG, such as the Java SecureRandom class, which is cryptographically secure and meets the randomness requirements for cryptographic applications."}
