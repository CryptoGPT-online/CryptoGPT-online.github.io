"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed})",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is designed to provide a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. However, the constructor with a single byte array argument is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, which can allow an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated. The attacker can use the fact that the PRNG is initialized with the same seed every time, and can use this knowledge to predict the sequence of random numbers. This can be a serious vulnerability, for example, if the generated numbers are used for cryptographic purposes, such as generating a private key.",
"recommendation": "Use a different constructor, such as the one that takes a SecureRandomParameters object, or use a different source of entropy, such as the System.getRandom() method."
