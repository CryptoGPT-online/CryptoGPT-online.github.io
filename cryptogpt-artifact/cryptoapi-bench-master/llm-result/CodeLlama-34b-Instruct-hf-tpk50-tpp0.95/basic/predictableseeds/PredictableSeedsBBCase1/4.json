"description": "The provided code uses a predictable seed for the SecureRandom object, which can be easily guessed and lead to a predictable random number sequence.",
"recommendation": "Use a truly random seed, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed(int numBytes) or a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) like the Salsa20 stream cipher."
