"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is vulnerable to timing attacks as it does not properly handle the iteration count. This can allow an attacker to recover the password and secret key.",
"recommendation": "Use the latest version of the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) which has fixed this vulnerability. Additionally, use a more secure password hashing algorithm such as PBKDF2 or Argon2."
