        "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The PBEParameterSpec class is vulnerable to cryptographic attacks if the salt and iteration count are not properly generated. In this code, the salt is generated using SecureRandom, but the iteration count is hardcoded to a low value. This can make the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, or better yet, use a different key derivation function such as Argon2 or bcrypt."
