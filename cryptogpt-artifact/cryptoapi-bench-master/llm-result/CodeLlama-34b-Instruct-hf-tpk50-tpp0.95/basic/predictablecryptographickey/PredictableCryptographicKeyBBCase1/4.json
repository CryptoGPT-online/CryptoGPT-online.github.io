"description": "The default key provided in the code is only 16 bytes, which is too small for AES. AES requires a key size of at least 128 bits, which is 16 bytes. Using a key that is too small can cause the encryption to be weak and easily breakable.",
"recommendation": "Use a key that is at least 16 bytes for AES encryption. It is recommended to use a secure random number generator to generate a random key."},

"description": "The key is hard-coded in the code, which makes it vulnerable to attacks. If the key is compromised, the encryption can be broken easily.",
"recommendation": "Do not hard-code keys in the code. Instead, use a secure key management system to generate and store keys securely."}
