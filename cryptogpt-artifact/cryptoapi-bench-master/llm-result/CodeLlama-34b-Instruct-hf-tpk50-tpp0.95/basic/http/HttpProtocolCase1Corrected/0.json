"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
"description": "The 'URL' class in Java is vulnerable to CWE-256, 295, 297, 321, 326, 327, 338, 547, 650, 757, 759, and 760. It can be used to launch a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by redirecting the user to a malicious website. Additionally, the 'URL' class does not perform any validation on the input URL, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. To fix this vulnerability, you should use a secure URL parsing library, such as the 'URI' class in Java, which performs more robust validation and escaping of special characters.",
"recommendation": "Replace 'new URL(url)' with 'new URI(url)' and import the necessary libraries."
