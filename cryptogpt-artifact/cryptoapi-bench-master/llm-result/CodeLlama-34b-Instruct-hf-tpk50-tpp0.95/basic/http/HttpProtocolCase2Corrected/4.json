"description": "The use of the `URL` class in Java is vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The `URL` class does not verify the validity of the URL, which means an attacker can intercept the request and redirect it to a malicious server. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the installation of malware on the user's device.",
"recommendation": "Use the `HttpURLConnection` class instead of the `URL` class. The `HttpURLConnection` class provides a more secure way of making HTTP requests, as it verifies the validity of the URL and can detect Man-in-the-middle attacks."
