"misuse": "Missing SSL/TLS Security Check",

"description": "The code is using the 'new URL(url)' constructor without verifying the SSL/TLS security of the connection. This can make the code vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and other security threats.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure URL connection, such as 'HttpsURLConnection', instead of 'URL' to verify the SSL/TLS security of the connection."
