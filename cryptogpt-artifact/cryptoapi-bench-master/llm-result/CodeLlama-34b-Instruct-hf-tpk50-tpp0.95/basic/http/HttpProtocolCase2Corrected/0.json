{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
"description": "The use of the URL constructor with the 'https' protocol can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, as the encryption is not properly verified. In this case, the attacker could potentially intercept the request and return a fake URL, leading to a phishing attack or other malicious behavior.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure URL constructor that verifies the encryption, such as the 'https' protocol with a certificate pinning mechanism."}
