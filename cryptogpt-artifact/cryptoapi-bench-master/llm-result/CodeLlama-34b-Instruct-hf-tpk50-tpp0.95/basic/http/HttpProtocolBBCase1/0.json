"description": "The URL constructor is used to create a URL object from a string. However, the string provided is not validated, which means an attacker could provide a malicious URL that would redirect the user to a phishing website or other malicious site.",
"recommendation": "Use a library like Apache HTTP Client or OkHttp that provides a safer way to handle URLs and validate user input."
