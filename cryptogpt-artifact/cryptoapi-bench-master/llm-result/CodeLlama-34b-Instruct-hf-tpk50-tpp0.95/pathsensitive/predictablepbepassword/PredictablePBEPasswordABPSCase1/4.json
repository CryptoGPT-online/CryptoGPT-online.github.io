"description": "The P1.key() method is using the PBEKeySpec class to generate a key based on a default password. The password is generated using a SecureRandom instance, but the method is not using a secure password generation method. The password is generated using the values of the iteration count and key length, which are not secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure password generation method, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to generate a secure password. Use a strong random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the salt for the password."
