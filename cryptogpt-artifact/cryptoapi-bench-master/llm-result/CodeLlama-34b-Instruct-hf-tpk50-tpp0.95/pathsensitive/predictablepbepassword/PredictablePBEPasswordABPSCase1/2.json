"description": "The key generation method uses a weak RNG (SecureRandom) to generate a random salt, which can be predicted by an attacker. This can lead to a weak encryption key being generated, making the encryption scheme vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure RNG, such as a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG), to generate the salt."
