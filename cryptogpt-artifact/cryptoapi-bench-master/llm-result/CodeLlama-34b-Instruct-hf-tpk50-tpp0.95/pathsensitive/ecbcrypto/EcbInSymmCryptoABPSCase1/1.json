"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance()",
"description": "The use of the 'Cipher.getInstance()' method without specifying the full algorithm name is considered insecure. This method uses the default algorithm for the specified operation, which may not be secure. In this case, the default algorithm for 'AES' is used, which is 'AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding'. However, this algorithm is vulnerable to a known attack called the 'ECB cut-and-paste attack'.",
"recommendation": "Specify the full algorithm name when calling 'Cipher.getInstance()' to ensure that the correct algorithm is used."
