 Here is the JSON response:
[
  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
    "description": "The AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which can be exploited to decrypt the encrypted data. The attacker can submit carefully crafted requests to the server to recover the plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure encryption mode such as AES/GCM/NoPadding, or use a secure authentication mode such as AES/CBC/HMAC-SHA256."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Key Generation",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The key generation algorithm used is not secure, as it does not use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the key. This can make the key predictable and vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key generation algorithm such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt to generate the key."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure IV Generation",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
    "description": "The IV generation algorithm used is not secure, as it uses a static value for the IV. This can make the encryption predictable and vulnerable to attacks such as a replay attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure IV generation algorithm such as SecureRandom to generate the IV."
  }
