    "description": "The AES algorithm is not a secure choice for encryption. It has been shown to be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as frequency analysis.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-256 with a secure mode of operation, such as GCM or EAX."

    "description": "The SecureRandom class is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. It uses the operating system's random number generator, which can be predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a true cryptographically secure random number generator, such as the Java SecureRandom class, to generate the initialization vector."
