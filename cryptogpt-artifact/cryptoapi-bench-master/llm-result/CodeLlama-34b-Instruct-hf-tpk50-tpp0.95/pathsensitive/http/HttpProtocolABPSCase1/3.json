{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "MD5", "description": "MD5 is a broken cryptographic algorithm that can be easily broken due to its weak collision resistance. It should not be used for any cryptographic purpose", "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of MD5"}]}
