"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "url = new URL(url)",
"description": "The URL class uses the default protocol handler to open the URL. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks if the attacker can intercept the communication between the client and the server.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure protocol like HTTPS and validate the server's certificate to ensure that the communication is secure."

{
"misuse": "Insufficient Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "int choice = 2",
"description": "The key size is too small, which can make it easier for attackers to perform brute-force attacks or other forms of cryptoanalysis.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key size, such as 2048 or larger."

"misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
"vulnerable_code": "choice = 2",
"description": "The randomness is not cryptographically secure, which can make it easier for attackers to predict the output of the algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure randomness source, such as SecureRandom in Java."
