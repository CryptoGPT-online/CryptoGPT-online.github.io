It should be replaced with a stronger algorithm such as SHA256 or SHA384.", "recommendation": "Replace the use of SHA1 with a stronger algorithm such as SHA256 or SHA384."},

{"misuse": "Insufficient Key Size", "vulnerable_code": "int choice = 2;", "description": "The code uses a weak key size of 2 bytes, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks. It should be increased to a stronger key size such as 16 bytes or more.", "recommendation": "Increase the key size to a stronger value such as 16 bytes or more."},

{"misuse": "Lack of Initialization Vector", "vulnerable_code": "String name = \"abcdef\";", "description": "The code does not use an initialization vector (IV) for the encryption, which makes it vulnerable to attacks that exploit the known plaintext. An IV should be generated and used for each encryption operation.", "recommendation": "Generate an IV for each encryption operation and use it in the encryption process."},

{"misuse": "Insecure Key Generation", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\").update(name.getBytes());", "description": "The code uses a weak key generation method by directly using the name string as the key. This makes it vulnerable to dictionary attacks. A more secure key generation method such as PBKDF2 should be used.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure key generation method such as PBKDF2 to generate the key."},
