  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
    "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm to hash the input string, which is a broken algorithm that can be vulnerable to collisions and other attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256, which is also used in the code.",
    "recommendation": "Change the code to use the SHA-256 algorithm instead of MD5. For example, replace the line 'MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")' with 'MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")'."
