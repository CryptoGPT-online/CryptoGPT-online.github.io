"description": "The code is using the SHA-256 algorithm, which has a key size of 256 bits. This is too small and can be easily broken using brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger hash function such as SHA-3 or SHA-512 instead."

"description": "The code is using the `if` statement to determine which hash function to use. However, this can be vulnerable to a timing attack, where an attacker can infer which branch of the `if` statement is taken.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and constant-time comparison instead, such as using `if(choice == 2)`."
