 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")", "description": "The MD4 algorithm is considered to be insecure, as it has been broken and vulnerable to collision attacks.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead."},
{"misuse": "Ciphertext Mangling", "vulnerable_code": "md.update(name.getBytes());", "description": "The `update` method is used to append data to the message digest, but the data is not properly padded, which can result in ciphertext mangling and corruption.", "recommendation": "Use a secure padding scheme such as PKCS#7 to properly pad the data before hashing it."},
{"misuse": "Weak Password Hashing", "vulnerable_code": "choice > 1", "description": "The password hash is derived from the user-provided password, but the hashing algorithm is weak and vulnerable to collision attacks.", "recommendation": "Use a stronger hashing algorithm such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt to properly hash the password."}
