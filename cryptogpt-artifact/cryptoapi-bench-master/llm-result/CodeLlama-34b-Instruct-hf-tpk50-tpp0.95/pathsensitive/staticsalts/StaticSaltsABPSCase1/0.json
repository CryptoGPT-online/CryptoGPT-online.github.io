 {"misuse": "Misuse of Randomness in Key Generation", "vulnerable_code": "if(choice>1) sr2.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The randomness used in the key generation is not properly generated and secured. It is possible for an attacker to predict the randomness used in the key generation, which can lead to a weak encryption key.", "recommendation": "Use a secure randomness source, such as SecureRandom, to generate the salt value for the key generation. Do not use a fixed or predictable value."}

{"misuse": "Weak Key Generation", "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);", "description": "The encryption key is generated using a weak password-based key derivation function (PBKDF) with a small iteration count. This can lead to a weak encryption key that can be easily brute-forced by an attacker.", "recommendation": "Use a strong PBKDF, such as PBKDF2, with a high iteration count to generate the encryption key. Increase the iteration count to a value of at least 10,000 or higher."}
