"description": "The code is using the RC4 cipher, which is a broken algorithm that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. The use of this algorithm is not recommended as it can compromise the security of the encryption.",
"recommendation": "The code should use a secure cipher such as AES to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data."
