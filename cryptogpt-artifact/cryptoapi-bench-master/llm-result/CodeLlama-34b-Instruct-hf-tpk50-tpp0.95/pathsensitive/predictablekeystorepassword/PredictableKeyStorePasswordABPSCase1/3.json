"description": "The `KeyStore.getInstance(type)` method is used to obtain a KeyStore instance without specifying the provider. This can lead to the use of a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm, which can result in a vulnerability.",
"recommendation": "Use the `KeyStore.getInstance(type, provider)` method to specify the provider, which can help ensure the use of a strong and secure cryptographic algorithm."

{
"misuse": "Insufficient Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
"description": "The `String.valueOf(random.ints())` method is used to generate a random string, but the length of the generated string is not specified. This can result in a vulnerability if the generated string is too short or too long, which can make it easier for attackers to guess the value.",
"recommendation": "Use the `SecureRandom.generateSeed(length)` method to generate a random string of a specific length, which can help prevent this vulnerability."
