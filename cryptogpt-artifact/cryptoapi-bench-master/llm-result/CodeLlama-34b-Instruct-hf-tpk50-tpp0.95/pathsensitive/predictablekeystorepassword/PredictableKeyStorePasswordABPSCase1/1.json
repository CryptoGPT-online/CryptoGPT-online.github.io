 {"misuse": "Insecure use of SecureRandom", "vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom();", "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers, but the default constructor uses a weak seed that can be predicted. This can lead to vulnerabilities in cryptographic operations that rely on randomness.", "recommendation": "Use a strong seed for the SecureRandom class, such as System.currentTimeMillis() or a cryptographically secure random number generator."}
