"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "RSA algorithm with a key size of 1024",
"description": "The provided code uses the RSA algorithm with a key size of 1024. This is a vulnerability because the RSA algorithm is not secure with a key size of 1024, as it can be broken by a brute-force attack. It is recommended to use a larger key size, such as 2048 or higher, to ensure the security of the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key size for the RSA algorithm, such as 2048 or higher, to ensure the security of the encryption."
