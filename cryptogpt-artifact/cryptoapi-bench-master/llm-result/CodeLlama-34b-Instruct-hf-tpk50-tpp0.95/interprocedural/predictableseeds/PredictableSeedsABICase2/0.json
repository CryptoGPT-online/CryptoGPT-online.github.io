"description": "The SecureRandom class is used with a broken crypto algorithm, which can result in predictable random numbers. This can lead to vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure crypto algorithm, such as SHA-256 or AES, or use a random number generator that is specifically designed to be secure, such as the Java SecureRandom class."}
