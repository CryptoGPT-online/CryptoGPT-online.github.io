        "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate cryptographically secure random numbers, but the `setSeed` method is used to set the seed for the random number generation, which can lead to the same sequence of random numbers being generated every time the code is run. This can cause a variety of security issues, including the potential for attackers to predict the random numbers and gain unauthorized access to the system.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the `setSeed` method with a call to `SecureRandom.generateSeed` to generate a new seed for the random number generation. Additionally, consider using a more secure random number generation method, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong`.")

Additionally, consider using a more random and unpredictable seed, such as a random string or a seed generated from a secure random number generation method.")
