"description":"Using a predictable seed with SecureRandom can lead to insecure random number generation. In this case, the seed is set to a fixed byte array, which can be easily predicted by an attacker.",
"recommendation":"Use a secure and unpredictable seed, such as a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator."}
