"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom().setSeed(seed);",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is designed to be a cryptographically strong random number generator, but it can be vulnerable to misuse. In this case, the seed is not a cryptographically strong random number, but a predictable value. This can lead to the attacker being able to predict the generated random numbers, which can compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, use a cryptographically strong random number as the seed, rather than a predictable value."
