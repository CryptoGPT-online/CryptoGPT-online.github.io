"description": "The `SecureRandom` class in Java uses a default seed of zero if none is provided. However, in this code, a specific seed is set, which is not secure and may lead to vulnerabilities. Additionally, using a `long` value as a seed may not be secure, as it may not be a cryptographically secure random number.",
"recommendation": "Use the `SecureRandom` class without setting a seed, or use a cryptographically secure random number generator (such as `java.security.SecureRandom`) to generate the seed."
