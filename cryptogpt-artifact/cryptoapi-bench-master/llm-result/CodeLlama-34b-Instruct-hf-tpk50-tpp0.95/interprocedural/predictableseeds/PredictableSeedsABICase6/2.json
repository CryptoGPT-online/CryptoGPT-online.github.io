"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used with a seed that is not properly generated, which makes the generated random numbers predictable.",
"recommendation": "Use a properly generated seed, such as `new SecureRandom(new SecureRandom().generateSeed(seedSize))`, to generate secure random numbers."
