{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)))",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor takes a salt and an iteration count as parameters, but the iteration count is not properly validated. An attacker could use a salt that is too small and an iteration count that is too high, leading to a vulnerable encryption scheme.",
"recommendation": "Use a validated and secure encryption scheme, such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR, and ensure that the iteration count is properly validated."
},

"misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
"vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt)",
"description": "The Random class is not cryptographically secure and should not be used for generating random numbers. An attacker could use this vulnerability to predict the random numbers generated and potentially exploit them.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate random numbers for encryption."
