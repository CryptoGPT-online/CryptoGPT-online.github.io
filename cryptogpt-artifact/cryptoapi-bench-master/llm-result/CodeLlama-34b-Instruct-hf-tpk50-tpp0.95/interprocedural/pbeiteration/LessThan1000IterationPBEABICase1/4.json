"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec class uses the PBKDF2 algorithm with a static salt and an iteration count, which can be vulnerable to attacks if the salt is predictable or the iteration count is too small.",
"recommendation": "Use a random salt and a sufficiently large iteration count (e.g. 10000 or more) for better security."
