"description": "The `PBEParameterSpec` class is used to create a parameter specification for a password-based encryption (PBE) scheme, but the `count` parameter is used insecurely. The `count` parameter specifies the number of iterations to perform, but it is not specified if the iteration count is secure. Using a low iteration count can make the encryption insecure.",
"recommendation": "Replace the `PBEParameterSpec` class with a secure alternative, such as `PBKDF2ParameterSpec`, and ensure that the iteration count is set to a secure value, such as 1000 or more."
