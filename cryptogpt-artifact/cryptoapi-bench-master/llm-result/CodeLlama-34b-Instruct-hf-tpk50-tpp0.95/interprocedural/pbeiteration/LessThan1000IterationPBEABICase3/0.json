  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "method1(c,random,pbe)",
    "description": "The code uses PBEParameterSpec with a 32-byte salt, which is too small for secure cryptography. A larger salt is needed to increase the security of the cryptographic algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the size of the salt to at least 64 bytes to improve the security of the cryptographic algorithm."
