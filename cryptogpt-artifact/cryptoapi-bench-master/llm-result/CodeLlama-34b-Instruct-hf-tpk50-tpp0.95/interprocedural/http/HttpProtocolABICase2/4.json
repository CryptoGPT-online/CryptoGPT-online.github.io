"description": "The `URL.toCharArray()` method is used to convert a URL to a char array, which can be vulnerable to timing attacks. The `toCharArray()` method does not ensure that the char array is properly randomized, which can allow an attacker to infer information about the original URL.",
"recommendation": "Replace `URL.toCharArray()` with `URL.toCharSequence()` and use a secure random number generator to generate the random sequence."
