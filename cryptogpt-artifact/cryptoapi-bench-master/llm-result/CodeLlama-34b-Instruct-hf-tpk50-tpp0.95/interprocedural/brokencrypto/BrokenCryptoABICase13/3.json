 {"misuses": [{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "RC4", "description": "RC4 is a broken encryption algorithm that should not be used. It is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including the Flame malware, which used a vulnerability in RC4 to decrypt data. Using a broken encryption algorithm like RC4 can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the data being protected.", "recommendation": "Use a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, instead of RC4. AES is a widely used and well-vetted encryption algorithm that is not vulnerable to the same types of attacks as RC4."}]}
