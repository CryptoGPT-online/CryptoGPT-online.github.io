"description": "The method2 function takes a string parameter c, which is passed to method1 without any validation. The method1 function then uses the string value as the crypto algorithm for generating a key and encrypting data. This allows an attacker to specify the crypto algorithm, potentially using a weak or broken algorithm that can be easily cracked.",
"recommendation": "The method2 function should validate the input string to ensure it is a valid crypto algorithm before passing it to method1. The validation should include checking the algorithm against a list of approved algorithms, and the method1 function should be updated to use a secure algorithm by default if the input algorithm is not valid."
