"description": "The use of the `RC2` algorithm is known to be insecure and should not be used for any purpose. It has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks and should be replaced with a more secure algorithm such as `AES`.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the `RC2` algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as `AES`."
