"description": "The use of the RC2 algorithm is insecure because it is a 64-bit block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. The algorithm has a small key space, which makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks. Additionally, the algorithm has a weak key schedule, which makes it vulnerable to differential attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, with a larger key size."
