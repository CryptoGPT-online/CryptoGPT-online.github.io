 {"misuses": [{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);", "description": "The KeyGenerator.getInstance() method is vulnerable to collisions, which can result in weak keys. In this case, the use of RC2, a broken algorithm, is particularly dangerous.", "recommendation": "Use a secure, up-to-date encryption algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20, instead of RC2. Additionally, use a secure key generation method, such as the Java Security API's KeyGenerator, to ensure that keys are generated securely."}]}
