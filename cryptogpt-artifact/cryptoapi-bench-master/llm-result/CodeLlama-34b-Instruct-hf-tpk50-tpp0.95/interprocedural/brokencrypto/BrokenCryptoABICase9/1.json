"description": "The crypto API is using the IDEA algorithm, which is a broken encryption algorithm and should not be used for any reason. It is vulnerable to known attacks and should be replaced with a more secure encryption algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Replace the usage of IDEA with a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
