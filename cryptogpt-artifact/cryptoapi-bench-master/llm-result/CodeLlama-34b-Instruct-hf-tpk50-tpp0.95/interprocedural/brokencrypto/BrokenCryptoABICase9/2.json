"description": "The crypto algorithm used in this code is insecure. IDEA is a weak and broken encryption algorithm that should not be used in new code. It is vulnerable to attacks such as differential cryptanalysis.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of IDEA with a secure and up-to-date encryption algorithm such as AES."
