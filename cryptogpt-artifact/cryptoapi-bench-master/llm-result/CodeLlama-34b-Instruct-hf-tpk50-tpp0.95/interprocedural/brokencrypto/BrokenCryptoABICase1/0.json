"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "DES",
"description": "DES is a broken encryption algorithm and should not be used for security purposes. It is considered insecure because it has a short key size of 56 bits, which is too small to be secure. It can be brute-forced in a relatively short amount of time.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a larger key size, such as AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256."

"misuse": "Misused Cipher",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The method Cipher.getInstance() should not be used to initialize a Cipher object with a cryptographic algorithm and mode of operation. This method is vulnerable to cipher injection attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the cipher text to execute arbitrary code or access unauthorized resources.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure method to initialize the cipher, such as using a pre-defined cipher from a secure library or a secure custom implementation."

"misuse": "Misused Key Generator",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(keyAlgo)",
"description": "The method KeyGenerator.getInstance() should not be used to initialize a KeyGenerator object with a cryptographic algorithm and mode of operation. This method is vulnerable to key injection attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the key generation process to generate a weak or predictable key.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure method to initialize the key generator, such as using a pre-defined key generator from a secure library or a secure custom implementation."
