"description": "Blowfish is a block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks, including linear and differential cryptanalysis. It is not considered secure for modern cryptographic purposes.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure and modern cipher algorithm, such as AES, instead of Blowfish."

"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto) uses the default SecureRandom implementation, which may not be cryptographically secure. It is recommended to use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), instead.",
"recommendation": "Replace KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto) with SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), to ensure the use of a secure random number generator."

"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE",
"description": "Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE is a vulnerable mode of operation for encryption, as it does not include any message authentication code (MAC) to detect tampering with the encrypted data. It is recommended to use a more secure mode, such as Cipher.GCM_MODE, which includes a MAC.",
"recommendation": "Replace Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE with Cipher.GCM_MODE, to ensure the use of a secure mode of operation for encryption."
