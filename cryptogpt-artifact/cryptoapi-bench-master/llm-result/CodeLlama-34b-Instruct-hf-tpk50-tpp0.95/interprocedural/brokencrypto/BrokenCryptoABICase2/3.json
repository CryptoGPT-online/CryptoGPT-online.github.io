"description": "The use of a broken crypto algorithm, such as Blowfish, can lead to vulnerabilities in the encryption and decryption process. Blowfish is a weak block cipher that has been shown to be susceptible to attacks such as linear and differential cryptanalysis.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger crypto algorithm, such as AES, instead of Blowfish. Additionally, consider using a more secure mode of operation, such as GCM or EAX, instead of ECB mode, which can provide better security against certain types of attacks."
