The method returns the default SSL context, which may not be secure.", "recommendation": "Use a secure SSL context created using SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\") or SSLContext.getInstance(\"SSL\") instead."},

This can lead to plaintext recovery attacks, where an attacker can retrieve the sensitive information stored in the array.", "recommendation": "Store the hostName variable securely using a secure cryptographic method, such as hashing and salting."},
