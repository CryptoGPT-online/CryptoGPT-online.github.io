"description": "The AES algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding is vulnerable to attacks such as padding oracle attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure cipher suite such as AES with GCM mode.",
"recommendation": "Replace the cipher with a more secure cipher such as AES with GCM mode."

"description": "The IV parameter should be generated using a secure random number generator. Using the bytes of a string as an IV can lead to a predictable IV, which can be exploited by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Replace the IvParameterSpec constructor with a secure random number generator."

"description": "The KeyGenerator class generates keys using a random number generator. However, it is important to use a secure random number generator that is resistant to compromise. The KeyGenerator class does not provide a way to specify a secure random number generator, and the default implementation may not be secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator such as SecureRandom to generate the key."
