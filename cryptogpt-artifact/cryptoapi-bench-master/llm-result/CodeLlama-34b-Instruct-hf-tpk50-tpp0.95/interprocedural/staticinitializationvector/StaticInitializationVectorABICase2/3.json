"description": "The `initialization` variable is a static variable that is initialized with a constant value. It is then converted to a byte array and used as the initialization vector (IV) for the AES encryption. This can lead to deterministic encryption, which can be vulnerable to attacks.",

"description": "The `KeyGenerator` class is used to generate a secret key for the AES encryption. However, the `generateKey` method is not passed any parameters, which means that the key is generated using the default algorithm and parameters. This can result in the use of a weak or insecure key, which can compromise the security of the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Pass appropriate parameters to the `generateKey` method to ensure that a strong and secure key is generated. For example, use the `KeyGenerator.getInstance` method to specify the key size and the algorithm to be used."
