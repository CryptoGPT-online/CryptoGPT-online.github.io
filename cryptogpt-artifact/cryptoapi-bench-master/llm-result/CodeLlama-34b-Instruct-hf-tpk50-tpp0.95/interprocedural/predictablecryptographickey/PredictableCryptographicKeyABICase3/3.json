"description": "The code uses the copyOf method from the Arrays class to create a new array with the same length as the original key. However, this is not a secure way to create a new array, as it may result in the original array being modified. Instead, the code should use the SecureRandom class to generate a new array of the desired length and then use the copyOf method to create a new array with the random bytes.",

"description": "The code uses a hardcoded key, which is a bad practice as it can be easily found and used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the data.",
"recommendation": "Replace the hardcoded key with a dynamically generated key, such as a random string or a hash of the user's password, and store it securely."

"description": "The code uses the getBytes() method to convert the key into a byte array, but this method is not secure as it may result in the key being guessed or brute-forced by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Replace the getBytes() method with a secure key generation method, such as the SecureRandom class, to generate a random byte array."
