"description": "The key is derived from a user-provided string, which is not a secure way to derive a key. It is possible for an attacker to guess the key based on the provided string.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or Argon2, to derive the key from the user-provided string. This will make it much harder for an attacker to guess the key."

"misuse": "Fixed Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\")",
"description": "The key size is fixed to 16 bytes, which is too small for AES. AES requires a key size of at least 128 bits, which is 16 bytes. Using a fixed key size makes it easier for an attacker to guess the key.",
"recommendation": "Use a variable key size, such as 256 bits, which is the recommended key size for AES. This will make it much harder for an attacker to guess the key."

{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\")",
"description": "The AES algorithm is not secure for use in this context. It is a symmetric block cipher, which means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This makes it vulnerable to attacks such as block replay and block flipping.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure asymmetric encryption algorithm, such as RSA or ECDSA, which are designed to be secure for use in this context. These algorithms use a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, which makes it much harder for an attacker to access the encrypted data."
