"description": "The provided key is not secure because it is derived from a fixed string and is not properly padded to match the key size of the cipher. This can allow an attacker to guess the key and decrypt the data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key generation mechanism, such as a key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to generate a secure key from the provided string. Additionally, use a secure random number generator to generate the salt for the KDF. Store the generated key securely and use it to encrypt and decrypt the data."
