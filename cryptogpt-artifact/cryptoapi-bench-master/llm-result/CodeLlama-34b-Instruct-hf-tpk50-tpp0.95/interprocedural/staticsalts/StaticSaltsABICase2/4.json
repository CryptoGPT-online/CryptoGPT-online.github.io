"vulnerable_code": "new PBEParameterSpec(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(salt.toString())}, count)",
"description": "The code uses a static and insecure salt value, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Additionally, the salt is generated from a string literal, which is not secure. A stronger and more secure method of generating a salt would be to use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.",
"recommendation": "Replace the static salt with a securely generated salt, such as SecureRandom.nextBytes()."
