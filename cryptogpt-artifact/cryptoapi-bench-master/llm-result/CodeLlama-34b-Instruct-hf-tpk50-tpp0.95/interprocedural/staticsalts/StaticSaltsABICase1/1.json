"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is passed a weak iteration count of 1020, which is a vulnerability as it can be easily brute-forced. ",
"recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 10000 or more, to make the password hashing more resistant to brute-force attacks."
