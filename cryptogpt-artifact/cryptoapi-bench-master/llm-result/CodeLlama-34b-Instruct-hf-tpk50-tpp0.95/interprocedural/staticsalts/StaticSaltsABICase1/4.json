"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
        pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec class is used to provide salt and iteration count parameters to password-based encryption (PBE) algorithms. However, the salt parameter is not strong enough, and the iteration count is too low. This can result in weak encryption and potential vulnerabilities.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, you should use a stronger salt value, and increase the iteration count to at least 10000. Additionally, you should use a different algorithm that is designed for password hashing, such as Argon2 or scrypt."
