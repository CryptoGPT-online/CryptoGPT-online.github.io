    "description": "The key size used in the RSA algorithm is 1024, which is insecure. The recommended minimum key size is 2048. Using a smaller key size can make the encryption easier to break.",
    "recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 2048 to ensure secure encryption."
  },

    "misuse": "Weak Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");",
    "description": "The code uses the RSA algorithm, which is a weak crypto algorithm. It is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including brute force attacks and side-channel attacks. Using a stronger crypto algorithm, such as AES, would be more secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger crypto algorithm, such as AES, to ensure secure encryption."
