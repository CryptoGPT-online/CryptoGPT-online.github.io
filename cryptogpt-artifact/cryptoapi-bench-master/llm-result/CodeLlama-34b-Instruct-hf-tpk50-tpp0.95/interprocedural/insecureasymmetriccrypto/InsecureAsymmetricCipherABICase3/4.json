"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\")",
"description": "The RSA algorithm used in this code is known to be broken and should not be used for secure communication. It has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks such as the Bleichenbacher attack, which can allow an attacker to recover the plaintext of an encrypted message.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of RSA with a secure algorithm such as AES or elliptic curve cryptography."
