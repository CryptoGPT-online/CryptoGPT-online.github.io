"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is broken and should not be used for secure applications. It can easily be collision-attacked and pre-image-attacked.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256, SHA-512, or BLAKE2b."
