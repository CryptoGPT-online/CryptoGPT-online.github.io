"description": "The MD2 hash algorithm is broken and should not be used for any purpose. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and is not considered secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead."},

"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The `MessageDigest` class is used to compute the hash of a string, but the `getInstance` method is used with a user-provided value, which could be a security vulnerability.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and approved method to get an instance of the `MessageDigest` class, such as using a hardcoded value or a value that is validated against a known list of secure algorithms."}
