"description": "The code uses a broken cryptographic algorithm, MD2, which is known to be insecure and vulnerable to collisions. It is not recommended to use this algorithm for any purpose, and it should be replaced with a secure alternative, such as SHA-256 or higher.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of MD2 with a secure alternative, such as SHA-256 or higher. For example, change the line 'String crypto = \"MD2\"' to 'String crypto = \"SHA-256\"'."
