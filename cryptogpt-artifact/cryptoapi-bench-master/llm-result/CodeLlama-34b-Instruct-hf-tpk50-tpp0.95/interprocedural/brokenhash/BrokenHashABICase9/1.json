"description": "The method is using the SHA1 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
"recommendation": "Replace SHA1 with SHA-256 or SHA-512 in the method signature and throughout the code."

"misuse": "Insufficient Randomness",
"vulnerable_code": "method1",
"description": "The method is using the `MessageDigest` class to generate a cryptographic hash of a string, but it is not using a secure source of randomness to generate the salt. This can make the hash more vulnerable to collision attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the salt and pass it as an argument to the `MessageDigest` constructor."
