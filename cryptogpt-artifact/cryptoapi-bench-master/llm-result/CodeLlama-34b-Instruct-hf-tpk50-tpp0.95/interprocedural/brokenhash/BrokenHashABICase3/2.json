"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The code is using the MD4 hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for any purpose. It is vulnerable to collisions and can be easily reversed, which can lead to serious security issues.",
"recommendation": "Replace the MD4 algorithm with a more secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
