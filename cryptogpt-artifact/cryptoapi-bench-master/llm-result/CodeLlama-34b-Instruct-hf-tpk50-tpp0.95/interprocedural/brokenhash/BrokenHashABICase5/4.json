"description": "The code uses the SHA1 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, for cryptographic purposes. Consider using a well-established and widely-used library for cryptographic operations, such as the Bouncy Castle library."
