        "description": "The `MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)` method is used with the `crypto` parameter, which is obtained from user input. This allows an attacker to specify the hash algorithm used for the digest, which could lead to a collision attack or other crypto-related vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Always use a strong, collision-resistant hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. Also, consider using a HMAC with a secret key, instead of a hash algorithm, to ensure the authenticity of the message."

        "description": "The digest of the message is printed to the console using `System.out.println(md.digest())`, which could potentially expose the hash value to an attacker. Storing sensitive information, such as hash values, in plain text can lead to unauthorized access or use.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a secure storage mechanism, such as a password manager or a key store, to protect the hash value."
