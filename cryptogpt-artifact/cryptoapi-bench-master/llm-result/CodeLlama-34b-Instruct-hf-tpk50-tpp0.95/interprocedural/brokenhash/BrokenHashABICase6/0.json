"description": "The code uses the MD5 hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for security purposes. It is vulnerable to collisions and preimage attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access and data tampering.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, or use a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES."

"vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(crypto)",
"description": "The code uses the `String.valueOf()` method to convert the `crypto` variable into a string, which can lead to insecure randomness. The `String.valueOf()` method may use the `toString()` method of the underlying object, which may not be secure for cryptographic purposes.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure randomness source, such as `SecureRandom`, to generate random values for cryptographic purposes."
