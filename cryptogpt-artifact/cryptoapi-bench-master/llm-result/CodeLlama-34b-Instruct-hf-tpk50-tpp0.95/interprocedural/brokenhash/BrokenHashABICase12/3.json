"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The code uses the MD2 hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for secure applications. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be used to create a collision attack that can cause the hash function to return the same value for two different input strings.",
"recommendation": "Replace MD2 with a secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. Use a secure key derivation function such as PBKDF2 or scrypt to derive the encryption key from the password. Implement proper password hashing and storage procedures, such as storing the password as a salted hash, to protect the passwords from being cracked."
