"description": "The MD2 algorithm is a cryptographic hash function that was developed in 1989. It was found to be vulnerable to collisions in 1994 and should not be used for any security-related purposes. In this code, the `method1` function uses the MD2 algorithm, which is a broken and insecure algorithm.",
"recommendation": "The `method1` function should be modified to use a more secure and reliable algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
