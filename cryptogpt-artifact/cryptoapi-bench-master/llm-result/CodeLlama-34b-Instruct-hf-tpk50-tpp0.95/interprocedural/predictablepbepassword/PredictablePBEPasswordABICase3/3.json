"description": "The PBEParameterSpec class uses a salt to randomize the derived key, which is important for security. Without a salt, the same derived key can be used for different passwords, making the encryption weaker.",

"recommendation": "Use a key length of at least 128 bits (16 bytes) to ensure that the encryption is secure."
