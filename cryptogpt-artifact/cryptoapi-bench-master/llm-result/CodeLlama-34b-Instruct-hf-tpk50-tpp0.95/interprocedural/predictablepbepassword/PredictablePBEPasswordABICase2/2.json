"description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm that is vulnerable to attacks. The algorithm uses a 48-bit derived key, which is too small to be considered secure.",
"recommendation": "Replace PBEKeySpec with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES-GCM or AES-CBC."

"vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey,salt,10000,16);",
"description": "The code uses the PBEKeySpec constructor to derive a key from a password. The constructor uses a weak key derivation function (KDF) that is vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Replace the PBEKeySpec constructor with a secure KDF such as PBKDF2 or Argon2."

"description": "The code defines a static and predictable key, which is vulnerable to attacks. An attacker can easily guess the key and gain unauthorized access to the encrypted data.",

"description": "The code converts the password to a char array, which is vulnerable to attacks. An attacker can use a rainbow table to crack the password and gain unauthorized access to the encrypted data.",
