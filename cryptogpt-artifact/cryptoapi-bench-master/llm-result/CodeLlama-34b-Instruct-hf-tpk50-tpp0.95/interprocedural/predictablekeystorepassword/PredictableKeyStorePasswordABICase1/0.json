"description": "The code is using the JKS (Java KeyStore) type, which is a proprietary format that is specific to Java. This format is not recommended for use in security-critical applications, as it has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks such as the FREAK attack. Additionally, the code is loading the key store from a remote URL, which is a security risk as it allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a standard and secure key store format such as PKCS12 or JWK, and load the key store from a local file or a secure remote server."
