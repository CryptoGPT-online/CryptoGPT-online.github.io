"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.go()",
"description": "The code uses the JKS (Java KeyStore) algorithm, which is a broken encryption algorithm that is vulnerable to attacks. The algorithm uses a 40-bit key, which is too small to provide adequate security.",
"recommendation": "Replace the JKS algorithm with a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA, and use a larger key size to improve security."
