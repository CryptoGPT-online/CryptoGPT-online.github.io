"description": "The key used for encryption is a static string, which can be easily discovered by attackers and used to decrypt the data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function (KDF) to derive the encryption key from a password or other strong secret. The KDF should be configured with a sufficient number of iterations to make brute-force attacks impractical."

"description": "The certificate store is being loaded from a remote URL using the insecure HTTP protocol. This allows an attacker to intercept the certificate store and potentially manipulate the data being encrypted.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure protocol, such as HTTPS, to load the certificate store. Consider using a trusted certificate authority (CA) to ensure the authenticity of the certificate store."

"description": "The encryption algorithm used, JKS, is known to be vulnerable to various types of attacks, including weak encryption and key prediction. It is recommended to use a modern encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM, which is considered secure and efficient.",
"recommendation": "Use a modern encryption algorithm that is designed to be secure and efficient, such as AES-GCM. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure encryption and key management."
