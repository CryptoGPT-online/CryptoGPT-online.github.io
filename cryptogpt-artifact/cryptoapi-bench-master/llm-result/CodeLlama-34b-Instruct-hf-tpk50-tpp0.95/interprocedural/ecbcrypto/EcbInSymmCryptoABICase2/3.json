"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
"description": "The method 'Cipher.getInstance' is used to obtain a cipher instance for encryption/decryption operations. However, the algorithm specified in the parameter 'crypto' is not specified explicitly and is vulnerable to attacks. In particular, the algorithm 'AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding' is a broken algorithm and should not be used.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm such as 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding' or 'AES/GCM/NoPadding' for encryption/decryption operations."
