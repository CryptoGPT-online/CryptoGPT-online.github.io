"description": "The provided seed is not being used in a cryptographically secure manner. The seed is being set using a non-cryptographically secure method, which may allow for predictable values to be generated.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the seed. Additionally, ensure that the seed is of sufficient length and entropy to ensure proper randomness."
