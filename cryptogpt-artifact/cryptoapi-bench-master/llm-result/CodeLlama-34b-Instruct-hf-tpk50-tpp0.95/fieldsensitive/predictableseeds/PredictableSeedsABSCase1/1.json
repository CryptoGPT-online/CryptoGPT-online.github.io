"description": "The SecureRandom instance is being re-seeded with a predictable value passedSeed, which can be guessed by an attacker and lead to a predictable output.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure randomness source, such as SecureRandom() or a hardware RNG, to generate a truly random seed. Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) for generating the seed instead of using a predictable value."
