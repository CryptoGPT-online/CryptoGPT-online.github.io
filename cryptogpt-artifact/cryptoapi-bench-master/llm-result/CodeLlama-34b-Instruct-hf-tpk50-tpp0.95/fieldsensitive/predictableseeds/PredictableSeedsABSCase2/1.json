"misuse": "Insecure use of SecureRandom",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed})",
"description": "The passed seed is not used as a seed for the SecureRandom, instead it is used as the only element in an array and passed to the SecureRandom constructor. This is insecure because it allows an attacker to predict the output of the SecureRandom by knowing the seed.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure way to generate seeds for the SecureRandom, such as using the Random.nextInt() method and passing the generated seed to the SecureRandom constructor."
