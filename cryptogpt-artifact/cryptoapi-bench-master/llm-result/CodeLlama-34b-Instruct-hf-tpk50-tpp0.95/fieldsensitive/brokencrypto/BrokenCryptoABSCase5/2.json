"misuse": "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C6.encrypt() method uses IDEA algorithm, which is considered insecure",
"description": "The IDEA algorithm is a symmetric key block cipher that was developed in the 1990s. It has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks and should not be used for secure communication. Instead, more modern and secure algorithms like AES should be used.",
"recommendation": "Change the algorithm used in the C6.encrypt() method to a more secure algorithm like AES. Additionally, consider using a more secure mode of operation like CBC or GCM, and using a larger key size."
