"description": "The C3 class uses the Blowfish algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for encryption purposes. It is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including brute force and side-channel attacks.",
"recommendation": "Replace the Blowfish algorithm with a secure and up-to-date algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20. Additionally, use a secure random number generator for key generation and ensure that the key is properly generated and used."

"vulnerable_code": "C3 class",
"description": "The C3 class generates the encryption key using the KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo) method, which is vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Additionally, the key is not properly generated and used, as it is not stored securely and is not used for decryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator for key generation and ensure that the key is properly generated and used. Additionally, store the key securely and use it for both encryption and decryption."

"misuse": "Insecure Cipher Mode",
"vulnerable_code": "C3 class",
"description": "The C3 class uses the Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Additionally, the cipher mode is not properly used, as it is not properly initialized and not used for decryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date cipher mode, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. Additionally, initialize the cipher mode properly and use it for both encryption and decryption."
