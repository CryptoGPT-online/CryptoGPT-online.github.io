        "description": "The encrypt() method is using the \"Blowfish\" algorithm, which is considered a broken cipher and should not be used for encryption. It was shown to be vulnerable to attacks in 1998.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the \"Blowfish\" algorithm with a secure and up-to-date encryption algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20. Also, consider using a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the encryption key."
