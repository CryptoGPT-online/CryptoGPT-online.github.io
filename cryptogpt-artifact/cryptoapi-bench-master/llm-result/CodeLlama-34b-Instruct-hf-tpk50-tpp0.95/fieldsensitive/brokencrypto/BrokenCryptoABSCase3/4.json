{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C4.encrypt",
"description": "The encrypt method uses the RC4 algorithm, which is a weak encryption algorithm and should not be used in practice.",
"recommendation": "Use a strong encryption algorithm such as AES with a secure mode of operation and a secure padding scheme."
},
{
"misuse": "Insufficient Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "C4.encrypt",
"description": "The encrypt method generates a secret key using the KeyGenerator class without specifying the keysize. This can result in the use of a key that is too small to provide adequate security.",
"recommendation": "Always specify the key size when using the KeyGenerator class to generate secret keys."
},
{
"misuse": "Insufficient IV Size",
"vulnerable_code": "C4.encrypt",
"description": "The encrypt method uses a default IV size of 8 bytes, which is not secure. A secure IV size should be at least 16 bytes.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure IV size of at least 16 bytes."
},
{
"misuse": "Insufficient Padding",
"vulnerable_code": "C4.encrypt",
"description": "The encrypt method uses no padding, which can result in vulnerabilities when encrypting data. A secure padding scheme should be used.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure padding scheme such as OAEP or PKCS#7."
},
{
"misuse": "Insecure Key Storage",
"vulnerable_code": "C4.encrypt",
"description": "The encrypt method stores the secret key in plaintext, which can result in vulnerabilities if the key is accessed by an unauthorized party.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure method of storing secret keys, such as a secure storage service or a hardware security module."
