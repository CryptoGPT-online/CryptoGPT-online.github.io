"vulnerable_code": "C3 class, constructor, passedAlgo parameter",
"description": "The constructor of the C3 class takes a parameter called passedAlgo, which is then used to determine the encryption algorithm. However, this parameter is not properly validated, and it is possible to pass in an empty string as the algorithm, which will result in the default algorithm being used, which is not secure.",
"recommendation": "Ensure that the passedAlgo parameter is properly validated to ensure that it is not empty and that it corresponds to a known and secure encryption algorithm."

"vulnerable_code": "C3 class, constructor, crypto parameter",
"description": "The constructor of the C3 class takes a parameter called crypto, which is used to set the default encryption algorithm. However, this parameter is not properly validated, and it is possible to pass in an arbitrary string as the algorithm, which could result in the use of an insecure encryption algorithm.",

"misuse": "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C3 class, encrypt method, md.digest() method",
"description": "The encrypt method of the C3 class uses the MD4 encryption algorithm, which is not considered secure. MD4 is a weak hash function that can be easily cracked, and it should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",
"recommendation": "Replace the MD4 algorithm with a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
