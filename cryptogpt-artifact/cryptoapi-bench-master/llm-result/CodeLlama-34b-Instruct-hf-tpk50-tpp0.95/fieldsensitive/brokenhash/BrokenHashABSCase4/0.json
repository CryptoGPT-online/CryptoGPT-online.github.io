"description": "The MD2 hash algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purpose. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily forged. The use of MD2 in the provided code is a security misuse.",
"recommendation": "The use of MD2 should be replaced with a secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512. The security of the code can be improved by using a secure hash algorithm that is not vulnerable to collision attacks."

"vulnerable_code": "crypto.encrypt(\"abc\",\"\")",
"description": "The provided code uses the MD2 hash algorithm to derive a key from a password. However, the key derivation function used is not appropriate for this purpose. The MD2 hash algorithm is not designed to be used as a key derivation function and should not be used for this purpose. The use of MD2 in the provided code is a security misuse.",
"recommendation": "The use of MD2 should be replaced with a secure key derivation function such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt. The security of the code can be improved by using a secure key derivation function that is specifically designed for this purpose."
