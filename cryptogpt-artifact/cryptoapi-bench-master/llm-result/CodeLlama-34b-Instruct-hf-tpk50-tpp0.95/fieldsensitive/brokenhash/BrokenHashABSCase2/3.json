"description": "The encrypt method uses the MD5 hash algorithm, which is a weak and broken cryptographic algorithm. It should not be used for encryption purposes. Instead, a stronger and more secure algorithm such as AES should be used.",
"recommendation": "Change the encrypt method to use a stronger and more secure algorithm such as AES for encryption purposes."
