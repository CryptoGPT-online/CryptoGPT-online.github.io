"vulnerable_code": "C1.encrypt() method",
"description": "The encrypt() method in class C1 uses a hardcoded default hostname and socket for encryption, which can be vulnerable to MITM attacks. The method should use a secure and configurable way to determine the hostname and socket for encryption.",
"recommendation": "The encrypt() method should take the hostname and socket as input parameters, and use a secure mechanism to determine the hostname and socket for encryption, such as using a configuration file or environment variables. The method should also validate the input parameters to prevent any malicious input."
