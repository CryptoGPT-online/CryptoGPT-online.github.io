"vulnerable_code": "crypto.method1(null);",
"description": "The method1() function is called with a null argument, which sets the salt to null. The salt is later used in the PBEParameterSpec constructor, which can result in a weak encryption key.",
"recommendation": "Do not use null as the salt argument in method1(). Instead, use a strong and unique salt value for each encryption operation."}
