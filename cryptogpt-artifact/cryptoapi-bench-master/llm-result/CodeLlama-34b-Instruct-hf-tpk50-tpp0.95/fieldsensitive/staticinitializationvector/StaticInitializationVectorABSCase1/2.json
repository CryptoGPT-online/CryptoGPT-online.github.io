"description": "The code uses a static, predictable IV (initialization vector) for encrypting data. This makes it vulnerable to attacks such as Ciphertext-only attacks. Additionally, the use of a predictable IV may also cause issues with deterministic encryption, where the same plaintext will always produce the same ciphertext.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the IV, and ensure that it is not predictable or deterministic. Additionally, use a secure and appropriate padding mode, such as PKCS#7 padding, and not PKCS#5 padding as used in the code."
