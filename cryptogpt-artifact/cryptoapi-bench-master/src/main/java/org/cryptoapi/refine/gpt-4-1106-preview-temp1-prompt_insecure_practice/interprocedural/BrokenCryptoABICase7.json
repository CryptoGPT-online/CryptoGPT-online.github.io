### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Conversion of String to Char Array" is a false positive. While it is true that sensitive information should be handled carefully, the misuse report does not accurately reflect a cryptographic API misuse. The code does not show sensitive information being stored in a char array; it shows the algorithm name being stored, which is not inherently sensitive.

2. "Improper Initialization Vector (IV) Usage" is a false positive in the context of RC4. RC4 is a stream cipher that does not use an IV, so the misuse report is not applicable. However, if the code were to switch to a block cipher, then proper IV usage would be a concern.

3. "Hardcoded Encryption Algorithm" is not necessarily a misuse. While it is a best practice to avoid hardcoding and allow for flexibility, the mere presence of a hardcoded algorithm does not constitute a misuse. It becomes a concern if the hardcoded algorithm is weak or broken, which is the case with RC4.

4. "Hardcoded Crypto Key" is a false positive. The code does not show a hardcoded encryption key. It shows the algorithm name being stored in a static variable, which is not the same as a cryptographic key.
