### False Positive Misuse ###
The provided code snippet demonstrates a typical and safe method of creating a `MessageDigest` with the "SHA-256" algorithm, which is a secure and widely recommended hashing algorithm for generating cryptographic hash values. The misuse lists are also empty, which means no misuses were reported.

Since using "SHA-256" is not a misuse and is in fact a good practice, and considering that no misuses are reported in the lists, there are no false positives to report.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
The misuse lists do not contain any entries, so there is nothing to optimize here. The optimized misuse JSON would also be empty, as the initial misuse lists are. The JSON is provided below, although it is identical to the provided misuse lists:
