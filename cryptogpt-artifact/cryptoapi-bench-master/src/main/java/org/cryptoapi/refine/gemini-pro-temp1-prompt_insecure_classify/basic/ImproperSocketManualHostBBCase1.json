[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
    "description": "The code uses the default SSLSocketFactory without specifying any trust manager or hostname verifier, which means it will accept any certificate presented by the server, including self-signed or expired certificates. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, you should configure the SSLSocketFactory to validate the server's certificate against a trusted certificate authority (CA). This can be done by setting the socket factory's trust manager to a TrustManager that verifies the certificate chain."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_method": "SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(\"my.host.name\", 443);",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(\"my.host.name\", 443);",
    "description": "The code creates an SSL socket without validating the certificate of the peer. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, you should set the SSL socket's hostname verifier to a HostnameVerifier that verifies the certificate of the peer. This can be done by calling the setHostnameVerifier method on the SSL socket."
