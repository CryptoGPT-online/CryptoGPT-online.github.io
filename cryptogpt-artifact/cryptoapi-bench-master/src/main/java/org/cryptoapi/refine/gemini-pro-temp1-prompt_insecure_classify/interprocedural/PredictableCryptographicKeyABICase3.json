    "vulnerable_method": "method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
    "description": "The cryptographic key is hard-coded in the source code, which makes it easy for attackers to obtain the key and compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the cryptographic key securely, such as using a cryptographic key generator or a secure random number generator."
