### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the listed misuses are false positives since the single-byte seed provided to SecureRandom does indeed lead to security vulnerabilities related to predictable random number generation. The context of seeding SecureRandom with a single, predictable byte is consistent across all reported misuses, and improving the randomness by relying on SecureRandom's default constructor is essential.

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});",
        "description": "The SecureRandom instance is being seeded with a predictable and low-entropy value (a single byte). This can lead to insecure and predictable random number generation, nullifying the intended security guarantees.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid providing your own seed for SecureRandom unless absolutely necessary. Use SecureRandom without explicitly seeding it, allowing it to be seeded with a secure seed by the underlying system."
