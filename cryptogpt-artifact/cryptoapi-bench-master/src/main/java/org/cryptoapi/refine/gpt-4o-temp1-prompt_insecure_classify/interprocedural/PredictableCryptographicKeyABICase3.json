### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength** misuse related to `keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);` is not an issue. This part of the code attempts to adjust the key length to match the necessary size for AES, which is valid given that AES requires keys of specific byte lengths. Truncating or padding to the correct length itself is common practice when dealing with user-provided data, but securing the key properly (generation and storage) is the critical concern in this context. The real issue is about how the key is initially provided and managed, not the truncation process itself.
