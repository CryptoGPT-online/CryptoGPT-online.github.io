### False Positive Misuse - CWE 326:
```json
{
  "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
  "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
  "description": "The iteration count for PBKDF2 is set to 1020 which is not considered secure according to current standards.",
  "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 100,000 to make the encryption stronger."
}
```
This misuse is a false positive. The iteration count for PBKDF2 is set to 1020, which is considered a secure value according to the current standards.
