False Positive Misuse:

    "vulnerable_method": "B7.main()",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"MD4\";",
    "description": "This is not a security vulnerability but an informational misuse. The hard-coded 'MD4' here is used for educational purpose to demonstrate the concept of cryptographic APIs in Java. As this is not an actual cryptographic algorithm, it does not present any security vulnerability.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the hard-coded cryptographic algorithm."
