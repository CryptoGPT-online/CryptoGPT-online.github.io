        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
        "description": "The code uses the SHA1 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. However, in this case, the SHA1 algorithm is used for message digest calculation, which is a legitimate use of the algorithm. The recommendation to replace the use of SHA1 with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 is not applicable in this case.",
