### False Positive Misuse

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Lack of proper handling of keys in SealedObject",
        "vulnerable_code": "new SealedObject(myMessage,cipher);",
        "description": "The SealedObject is used with only a public key, which could introduce potential future issues if the key pair changes for encryption or decryption. However, since no actual encryption is performed in this code snippet, it might not be a problem in this context.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using SealedObject with the correct private key to ensure security and consistency. Although this isn't a problem in the given context, it is worth considering future potential issues."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Broad exception handling",
        "vulnerable_code": "Catching all types of exceptions in the code",
        "description": "Broad exception handling can mask specific errors and make it harder to debug the code. It's usually better to catch only specific, meaningful exceptions. This code is just an example and doesn't throw any meaningful exceptions.",
        "recommendation": "Consider removing the broad exception handling in the code snippet as it doesn't really solve any problem. Broad exception handling is usually avoided in production code."
