### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest getInstance(String algorithm)",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm for hashing, which is a broken and insecure algorithm vulnerable to collision attacks. Attackers can easily find two different messages that hash to the same value using MD4.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of MD4."
