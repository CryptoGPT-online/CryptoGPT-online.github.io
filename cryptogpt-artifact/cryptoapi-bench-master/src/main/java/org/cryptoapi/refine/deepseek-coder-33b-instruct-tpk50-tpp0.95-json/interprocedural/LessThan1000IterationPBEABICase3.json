The misuses list provided includes several false positive situations:

1) In the first JSON array: the assignment of a new `PBEParameterSpec` object to `pbe` is correctly used in the subsequent code, so the misuse "PBEParameterSpec Salt Not Used Properly" is a false positive as it doesn't seem to be applicable in this context. 

2) In the second JSON array: the variable `pbe` in `method1()` is not used after the assignment. There is no NullPointerException potentially thrown here. So, this "NullPointerException" misuse is a false positive.

3) The last JSON array is also a false positive misuse as PBEParameterSpec is properly declared final in the provided context.

Based on these findings, there is no need to remove any false positives and the list of misuses can remain as it is. If the list included only non-false positive cases, it should be a more robust analysis.
