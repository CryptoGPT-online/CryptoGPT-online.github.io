  {
    "misuse category": "Use of Hard-Coded Cryptographic Key",
    "vulnerable_method": "P2.go()",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = \"defaultkey\";",
    "description": "The encryption key is hard-coded in the source code, which makes it easily accessible to attackers.",

    "vulnerable_method": "P2.go()",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The key derivation function used to generate the AES key is insecure. The `toString()` method on a `char[]` returns the string representation of the array, which is not suitable for use as a cryptographic key. Additionally, the `Arrays.copyOf()` method is used to truncate the key to 16 bytes, which may result in a weak key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to generate the AES key. Ensure that the key is of sufficient length and entropy."
