### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The "Insecure Protocol" misuse that refers to the use of `cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com");` is a false positive. The code is using HTTPS, which is a secure protocol. The misuse would be valid if the code was using HTTP or if there were additional context showing that the SSL/TLS certificate validation was being bypassed or improperly handled.

2. The "Insecure Protocol" misuse that mentions the use of 'JKS' type for KeyStore and trusting certificates from a non-specific source is a false positive. The use of 'JKS' is a valid concern but should be listed under a different misuse related to the keystore type. Trusting certificates from a URL does not apply here since the code is not setting up a trust manager or making SSL/TLS connections based on the keystore loaded from the URL.

3. The "Inadequate SSL/TLS Trust Management" misuse is a false positive. The code provided does not show any custom SSL/TLS trust management, and it is not clear from the given code snippet whether the default trust management is inadequate.
