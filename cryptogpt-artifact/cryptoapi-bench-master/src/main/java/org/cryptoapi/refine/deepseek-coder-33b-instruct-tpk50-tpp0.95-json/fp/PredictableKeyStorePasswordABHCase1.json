### False Positive Misuse
{
    "misuse category": "Insecure Randomness",
    "vulnerable_method": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The random.ints() method generates a stream of pseudorandom int values. If the stream is unlimited, this could lead to issues. For example, the key might be the same each time the application runs. This could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, for instance `SecureRandom`. This will produce a random number with more entropy."
}

### Optimized Misuse JSON
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecurely generated KeyStore password",
        "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
        "description": "The KeyStore password is being generated by converting a `String` of random numbers, which might not be very secure. If an attacker were able to guess the contents of the keystore, this password would be useless.",
        "recommendation": "Implement a more secure way to generate the KeyStore password, such as a password generator or key vault."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Loading KeyStore from remote URL",
        "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), new String(keyBytes).toCharArray());",
        "description": "Loading a KeyStore from a remote URL can be a serious security issue, as the KeyStore could be tampered with. If the URL is controlled by an attacker, they could load a malicious KeyStore, leading to serious security risks.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of loading KeyStore from a remote URL, consider storing the KeyStore locally, and then loading it from a local file path."
