### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: Predictable Key Generation**
    - **Vulnerable Code**: "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo); SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();"
    - **Reason**: The alert regarding predictable key generation in this context appears as a false positive since modern Java implementations provide a default SecureRandom, and this code does not explicitly set a weak source. However, explicitly setting a strong random source like SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() can still be a good practice for critical operations.
