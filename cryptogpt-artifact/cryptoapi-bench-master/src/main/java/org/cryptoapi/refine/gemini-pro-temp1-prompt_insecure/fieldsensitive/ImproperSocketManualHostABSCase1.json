### False Positive Misuse ###

**Insecure Default**

* **Reported Misuse:** The default hostname and port are hardcoded, which can be insecure if the application is intended to connect to different endpoints.
* **Explanation:** This is not a misuse in the given context. The code is creating a client socket with a default hostname and port, which is common for many applications that connect to a specific server. If the application needs to connect to different endpoints, it can override the default hostname and port when creating the socket.
