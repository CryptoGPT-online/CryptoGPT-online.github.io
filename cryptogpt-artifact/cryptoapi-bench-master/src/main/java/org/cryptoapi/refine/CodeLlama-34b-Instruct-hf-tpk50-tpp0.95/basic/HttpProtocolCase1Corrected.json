 You have provided me with a code snippet and a JSON list of potential cryptographic API misuses. I have carefully reviewed the code and the misuses list, and I have identified several false positive misuses in the provided JSON.

Here are the optimized misuses JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
    "description": "The use of `new URL(url)` without specifying the protocol can lead to a broken crypto algorithm vulnerability. The `URL` constructor uses the `http` protocol by default, which may not be secure for some applications.",
    "recommendation": "Always specify the protocol when creating a URL object using `new URL(protocol, url)` to ensure the correct protocol is used."
  }
]
```
In this optimized misuse JSON, I have removed the false positive misuses, and I have left only the relevant and accurate misuses that are applicable to the provided code. The optimized misuses JSON only contains the following misuse:

* Misuse 1: Broken Crypto Algorithm
	+ Vulnerable Code: `new URL(url)`
	+ Description: The use of `new URL(url)` without specifying the protocol can lead to a broken crypto algorithm vulnerability. The `URL` constructor uses the `http` protocol by default, which may not be secure for some applications.
	+ Recommendation: Always specify the protocol when creating a URL object using `new URL(protocol, url)` to ensure the correct protocol is used.

I hope this optimized misuse JSON helps you to identify and fix the potential cryptographic API misuses in your code.
