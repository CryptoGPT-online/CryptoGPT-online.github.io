[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "S2.key2",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(salt.toString())}, count);",
    "description": "The code uses a weak salt for the PBEParameterSpec. The salt is derived from the default salt \"12345\" and then converted to a byte array. This salt is too short and easy to guess, making the encryption weak.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and randomly generated salt for the PBEParameterSpec. The salt should be at least 16 bytes long and should be generated using a secure random number generator."
  },

    "misuse category": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "S2.<clinit>",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static final String DEFAULT_SALT = \"12345\";",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded default salt, which is \"12345\". This salt is not secure and can be easily guessed, making the encryption weak.",
    "recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials. Instead, generate a strong and unique salt for each user or session."
