### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials**
   - Description: The mention of hardcoded credentials seems to be a misunderstanding here. While the `DEFAULT_SEED` is hardcoded, it is not being used as a credential or sensitive key value directly exposed to compromise system authentication or access control.
   - Reason: This is a misleading categorization for the misuse because the hardcoded string, in this context, is intended for seeding `SecureRandom`, not for credentials. Therefore, the context of the misclassification seems off-target considering its application.
   
2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - Description: This type of warning is generally relevant to cryptographic algorithms with weaknesses due to algorithm choice or key size.
   - Reason: The misuse reported is about seeding `SecureRandom` with a hardcoded value, which falls under insufficient randomness, not encryption strength, hence this categorization is incorrect in this case.
