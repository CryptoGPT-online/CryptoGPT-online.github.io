### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Missing IV for CBC mode and equivalents" - This is a false positive because the code is using ECB mode, not CBC or any other mode that requires an IV. While ECB is insecure, the misuse related to the IV is not applicable here.

2. "Static Initialization Vector" - This is a false positive because the code does not use an IV at all (due to the use of ECB mode). The recommendation is valid for modes that use an IV, but not for ECB.

3. "Lack of Secure Random Initialization Vector (IV)" - This is a false positive for the same reason as above; ECB mode does not use an IV.
