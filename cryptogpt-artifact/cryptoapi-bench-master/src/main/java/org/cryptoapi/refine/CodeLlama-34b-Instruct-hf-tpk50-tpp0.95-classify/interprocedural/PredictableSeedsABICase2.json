        "description": "The seed value used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is not truly random and may be predictable, which can weaken the security of the random number generation.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure and unpredictable method to generate the seed value, such as using the Random class to generate a random byte array, or using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the seed value."
