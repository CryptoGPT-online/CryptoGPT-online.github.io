False Positive Misuse:

The misuse mentioned in the first list is indeed a false positive. It's correct to set the passedSeed to defSeed, but this is not a misuse of a cryptographic API, but rather a normal variable assignment. 

As the seed for SecureRandom is not user-supplied, and SecureRandom doesn't use the passedSeed as a seed, but rather sets it as its own internal state. Therefore, this is not a misuse of SecureRandom API.
