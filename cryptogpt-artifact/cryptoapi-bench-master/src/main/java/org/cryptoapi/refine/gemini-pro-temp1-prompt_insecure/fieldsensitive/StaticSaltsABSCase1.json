### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

The misuse report flags the usage of the `C1` class as a potential security issue, categorizing it as CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. Upon further analysis of the context, it is evident that the class `C1` is user-defined and lacks any implementation. Without a clear understanding of how the algorithm is implemented within the `C1` class, it is not possible to determine its cryptographic strength or potential vulnerabilities. Therefore, this misuse can be considered a false positive.
