 ### False Positive Misuse JSON
```json
{
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"MD4\"",
    "description": "The default cryptographic algorithm used is MD4, which is considered weak and outdated. It is recommended to use more secure algorithms such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead.",
    "recommendation": "Update the code to use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, by changing the DEFAULT_CRYPTO constant."
}
```

### Optimized Misuse JSON

```json
{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
}
```
This misuse report suggests that the code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. The recommendation is to use a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, instead of MD4.
