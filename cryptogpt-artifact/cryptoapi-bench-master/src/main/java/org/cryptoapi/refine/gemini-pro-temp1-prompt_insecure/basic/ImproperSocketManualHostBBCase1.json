```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
    "description": "Using the default SSLSocketFactory implementation may result in weak encryption algorithms being used, which could allow an attacker to intercept and decrypt network traffic.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure SSLSocketFactory implementation that supports TLS 1.2 or higher and strong cipher suites."
