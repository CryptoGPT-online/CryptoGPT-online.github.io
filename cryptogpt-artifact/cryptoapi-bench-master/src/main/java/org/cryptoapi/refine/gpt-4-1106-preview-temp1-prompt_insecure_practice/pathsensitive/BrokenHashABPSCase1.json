### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Inadequate Key Size" is a false positive. The key size is not directly applicable to the use of a hashing function like SHA-256. SHA-256 has a fixed output size of 256 bits, which is considered secure and does not have a configurable key size like symmetric encryption algorithms do.

2. The misuse "Insecure Hash Algorithm" related to SHA-256 is a false positive. SHA-256 is currently considered a secure hashing algorithm and does not have any known vulnerabilities that would make it insecure. The recommendation to migrate to SHA-3 is more of a best practice for future-proofing rather than a current security necessity.

3. The misuse "Use of a Broken Crypto Algorithm" is partially a false positive. While SHA-1 is indeed considered weak, the code is conditionally using SHA-256 when `choice > 1`, which is a secure algorithm. Therefore, the misuse should only apply when SHA-1 is actually used.
