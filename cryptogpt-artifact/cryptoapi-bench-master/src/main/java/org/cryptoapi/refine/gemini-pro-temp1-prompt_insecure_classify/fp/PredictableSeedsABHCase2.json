### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "java.security.SecureRandom.setSeed(byte[])",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] seed = {b, b};\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The code uses a constant value as the seed for `SecureRandom`, which makes the generated random numbers predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`, and provide it with a sufficient amount of entropy, such as from a hardware random number generator or a strong pseudorandom number generator seeded with a secure random seed."
