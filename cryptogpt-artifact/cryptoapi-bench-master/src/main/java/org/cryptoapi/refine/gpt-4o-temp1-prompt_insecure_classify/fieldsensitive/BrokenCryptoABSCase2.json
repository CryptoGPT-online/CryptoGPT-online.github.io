### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - This warning is not applicable here. The focus here is on using a SecureRandom instance for generating keys. However, the specific risk mentioned is about not specifying a secure random seed, which isn't required at this context as KeyGenerator by itself is already implemented to use Java's strong random source. The concern here is more accurately related to key size than random seed.

2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength** - This is also not applicable in its specific context, as the primary issue here is not about the randomness or the strength of keys (unless explicitly stated key size becomes default which is inherently weak). Instead, the concern is more accurately captured in CWE-327 regarding Blowfish's block size.

        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C3(\"Blowfish\");",
        "description": "The code uses the Blowfish encryption algorithm, which is considered to be a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm due to its small block size of 64 bits, making it vulnerable to certain attacks (e.g., birthday attacks on large data sets).",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit key size."
