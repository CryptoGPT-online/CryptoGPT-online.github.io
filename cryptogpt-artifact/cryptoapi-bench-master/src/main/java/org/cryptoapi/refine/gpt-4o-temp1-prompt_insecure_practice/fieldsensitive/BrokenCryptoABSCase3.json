### False Positive Misuse ###

There are no false positives in this misuse report. All identified issues related to the use of RC4 as a default algorithm and the potential hardcoding/overreliance on insecure defaults are valid concerns given the context.

        "description": "RC4 is a stream cipher that has been found to have several vulnerabilities which can be exploited to compromise encrypted data. It is considered insecure and should not be used.",
        "recommendation": "Replace RC4 with a more secure algorithm, such as AES, which is widely accepted for encryption purposes."

        "description": "The code allows the use of a potentially insecure algorithm if an empty string is passed. Defaulting to an insecure algorithm if no algorithm is specified can lead to insecure encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that a secure encryption algorithm is always used, even when defaults are applied. Consider validating the algorithm before use."
