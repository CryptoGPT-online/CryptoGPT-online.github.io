    "description": "The code is using the less secure algorithm specified in the constructor (`crypto`) if the `passedAlgo` is empty. This allows an attacker to force the use of a weak algorithm by providing an empty string for `passedAlgo`.",
    "recommendation": "Always use a secure algorithm, regardless of the value of `passedAlgo`. If a secure algorithm is not specified, an exception should be thrown."
