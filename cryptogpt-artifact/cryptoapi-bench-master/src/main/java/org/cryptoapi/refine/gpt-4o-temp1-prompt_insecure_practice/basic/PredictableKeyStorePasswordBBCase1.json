### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: Trusting All Certificates/Insecure TrustManager/Trusting SSL/TLS without Validation/Load Keystore from Insecure URL**

   There are multiple reported variations regarding the use of an URL to load a KeyStore, such as "Trusting All Certificates", "Insecure TrustManager", and "Trusting SSL/TLS without Validation". However, the code snippet simply initializes a URL object pointing to "https://www.google.com" and does not explicitly implement a certificate validation mechanism. Without additional context or a custom TrustManager explicitly set to trust all certificates, it cannot be definitively concluded that the misuse is present based on the given code. The misuse would only be valid if there was evidence of insecure handling or disabling of certificate validation in a SSL/TLS context.
