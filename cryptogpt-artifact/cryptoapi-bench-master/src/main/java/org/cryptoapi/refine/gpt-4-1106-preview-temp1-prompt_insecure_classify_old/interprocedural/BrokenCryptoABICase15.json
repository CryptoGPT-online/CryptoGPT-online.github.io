### False Positive Misuse ###

The second misuse reported in the lists is a false positive:
- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

This misuse is reported because of the assumption that KeyGenerator is not seeded with a secure random source. However, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) promises that by default, a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) will be used to seed the KeyGenerator when a call to `KeyGenerator.getInstance()` is made without explicitly specifying a SecureRandom instance. This is in accordance with Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) recommendations.

Therefore, unless there is additional context or evidence that the underlying default RNG has been compromised or is insufficient, the default behavior of `KeyGenerator` would not constitute an insecure use of insufficiently random values.
