    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses the default key size for AES encryption, which is inadequate for many applications. It is recommended to use a key size of at least 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as AES-256, by specifying the key size when generating the key."

    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code generates a secret key using the default `KeyGenerator`, which may not be sufficiently random for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate a random key. This can be achieved by using the `SecureRandom` class provided by Java."
