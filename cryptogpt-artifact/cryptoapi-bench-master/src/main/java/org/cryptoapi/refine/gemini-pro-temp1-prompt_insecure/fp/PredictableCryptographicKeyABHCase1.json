### False Positive Misuse ###

**CWE-328: Use of Key Derivation Function (KDF) with Insufficient Iteration Count**

This misuse is a false positive because the provided code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a key for AES encryption, but it does not specify the number of iterations for the key derivation function (KDF). By default, `SecureRandom` performs a sufficient number of iterations (1024) to generate a secure key. Therefore, this misuse is not applicable to the provided code.
