### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Insecure Trust Management" and "Improper Certificate Validation" misuse reports are false positives. The code is loading a KeyStore from a URL, which is not inherently insecure as long as the URL is trusted and the connection is over HTTPS, as is the case with "https://www.google.com". However, the misuse could be valid if the KeyStore itself is not trusted or if the URL is not a trusted source. Since the URL is hardcoded to "https://www.google.com", it is unlikely to be a source of MITM attacks, but the practice of loading KeyStores from URLs should be scrutinized in a real-world scenario.

2. "SSL/TLS Verification Bypass" misuse report is a false positive. The code does not show any bypass of SSL/TLS verification. The URL is accessed over HTTPS, and there is no indication that the default trust manager has been altered or that certificate verification has been disabled.

3. "Exposing Sensitive Information" misuse report is a false positive. The URL "https://www.google.com" is not sensitive information, and storing the URL of a KeyStore is a common practice. The misuse would be valid if the URL contained sensitive parameters or if the KeyStore location was sensitive and not protected by other means.

4. "Inadequate Exception Handling" misuse report is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse. While it is a good practice to handle exceptions properly, this is not directly related to the cryptographic operations or the security of the cryptographic APIs being used.
