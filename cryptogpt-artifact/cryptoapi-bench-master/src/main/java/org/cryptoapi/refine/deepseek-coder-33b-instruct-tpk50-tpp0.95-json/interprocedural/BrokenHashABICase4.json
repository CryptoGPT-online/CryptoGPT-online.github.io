## False Positive Misuse
No false positives detected in the misuse list. The used cryptographic algorithm is MD2 and MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto) is directly setting the algorithm according to the user input.

        "misuse category": "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm Used",

        "description": "The MD2 cryptographic hash algorithm is insecure and should not be used. It was developed before SHA-1 was finalized. A collision could potentially have occurred. There are no known practical uses for MD2.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using MD2, use a stronger hashing algorithm like SHA-256, SHA-3, or even better, Argon2, Bcrypt, or Scrypt which are currently considered as very secure and efficient hashing algorithms."
