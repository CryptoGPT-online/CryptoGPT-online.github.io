None of the provided misuses are considered false positives. These all contain potential cryptographic API misuses that should be addressed according to the recommendations provided.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "Broken Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generation",
    "vulnerable_method": "P1.main(String [])",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(); sr.setSeed(bytes); int v = sr.nextInt();",
    "description": "This code is setting a seed with a constant value, which can lead to predictable numbers being generated. This weak seed can be exploited in a number of ways, like in cryptographic algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using SecureRandom with a static seed. Always use a unique seed to make your random number generation more secure."

    "misuse category": "Insecure use of SecureRandom",
    "vulnerable_method": "P1.main(String [])",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes)",
    "description": "Setting a custom seed for SecureRandom can make the generated random numbers predictable. If the seed is predictable or can be guessed, the random numbers generated are also predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the setSeed method call, or replace it with a more secure method to generate a random seed. SecureRandom can generate a secure seed on its own, or you can obtain a secure seed from another secure random number generator."
