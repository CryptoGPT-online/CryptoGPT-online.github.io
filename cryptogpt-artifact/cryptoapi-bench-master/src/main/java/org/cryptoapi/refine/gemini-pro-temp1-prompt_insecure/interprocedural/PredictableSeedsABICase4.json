  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Entropy",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom.<init>(byte[])",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a seed that is derived from the `seed` variable, which is a reference to the `SEED` array. This means that the seed used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is not truly random and can be easily predicted, making the generated random numbers non-random and predictable.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, you should use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is initialized with a truly random seed. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to create a CSPRNG that is suitable for cryptographic purposes."

    "misuse category": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage in a File or Database",
    "vulnerable_method": "toCharArray()",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static char[] SEED = DEFAULT_SEED.toCharArray();",
    "description": "The seed value is stored in a plaintext array, which could be easily compromised if the program is compromised.",
    "recommendation": "Store the seed value in a secure location, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a key management system."
