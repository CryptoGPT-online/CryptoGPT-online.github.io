### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Cipher Initialization Vector (IV) Not Specified** (`cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,keySpec);`) - This seems to be a false positive because the code associated with the misuse (`cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,keySpec);`) does not contain enough context to conclude the absence of an IV. Indeed, the misuse would be present if no IV were used with CBC mode; however, without showing the initialization of the `Cipher` object and how it's used, we cannot assume this misuse.

2. **CWE-330: Use of defaultKey as a non-random value** (`defaultKey = defkey;`) - While it is true that a non-random default key is insecure, this report may be considered as a false positive because it identifies a potential problem based on the assignment, rather than the actual usage or generation of `defkey`. The misuse would be more accurately framed around the insecure practice of accepting a default key which can be weak, rather than the assignment itself.
