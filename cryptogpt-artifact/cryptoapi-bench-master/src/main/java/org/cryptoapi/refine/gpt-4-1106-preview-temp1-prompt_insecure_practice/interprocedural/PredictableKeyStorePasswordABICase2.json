### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Insecure Trust Management" related to loading the KeyStore from a URL is a false positive. The URL provided (`https://www.google.com`) is used as an example and does not necessarily indicate that the KeyStore is being loaded from this URL in a production environment. Moreover, the URL is an HTTPS URL, which implies that the connection is encrypted. However, the misuse could be valid if the URL is not under the control of the site owner or if the SSL certificate is not properly validated.

2. The misuse "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" and "Use of Weak KeyStore Type" related to the use of JKS as the KeyStore type is a false positive. While JKS is considered less secure than PKCS12, it is not inherently broken. The recommendation to use PKCS12 is valid, but the misuse is not necessarily a security vulnerability if the JKS is used in a secure manner with strong passwords and proper management.

3. The misuse "Exposure of Sensitive Information" and "Sensitive Data Exposure" related to storing the encryption key in a static variable is a false positive. The encryption key in this context is used to load the KeyStore, and while it is stored in a static variable, there is no indication that it is exposed outside of the class or that it is logged or printed in any way. However, the recommendation to avoid storing sensitive information in static variables is a good practice.

4. The misuse "Insecure Key Management" and "Insecure Default Encryption Key" related to the hardcoded encryption key is a false positive. The key is used for loading the KeyStore, not for encryption purposes. While using a hardcoded key is not a best practice, it is not a misuse in the context of loading a KeyStore.

5. The misuse "Static Encryption Key" is a false positive. The key is not used for encryption but for loading the KeyStore. The recommendation to dynamically generate keys is not applicable in this context.

6. The misuse "Improper Certificate Validation" is a false positive. There is no evidence in the provided code that certificate validation is not performed. The URL is accessed over HTTPS, which by default includes certificate validation unless explicitly disabled.

7. The misuse "Inadequate Encryption Strength" is a false positive. The character array `ENCRYPT_KEY` is used to load the KeyStore, not for encryption purposes. The strength of the key is not relevant in this context.
