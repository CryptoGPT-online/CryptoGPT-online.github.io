        "description": "The algorithm MD5 is hardcoded in the constructor, which limits the flexibility to change the algorithm. Also, MD5 is considered weak and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Allow the algorithm to be provided as a parameter and avoid using weak algorithms like MD5 for cryptographic operations."

        "description": "The MessageDigest.getInstance is called with 'crypto' parameter without explicitly specifying the source of randomness. This could lead to insecure randomness and impact the security of cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Specify a secure source of randomness using SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() or SecureRandom.getInstance() explicitly while creating the MessageDigest object."
