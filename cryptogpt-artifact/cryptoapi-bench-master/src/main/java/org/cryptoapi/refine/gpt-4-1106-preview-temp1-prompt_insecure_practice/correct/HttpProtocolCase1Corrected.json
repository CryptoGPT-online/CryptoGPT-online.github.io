### False Positive Misuse ###
In this case, you've presented a simple Java program that only creates a new `URL` object with a hard-coded string representing a Google URL. There is no cryptographic API usage within this code snippet. Therefore, discussing cryptographic API misuse is not relevant here. 

The misuse lists provided are empty, which is accurate because there are no cryptographic APIs being used in the code for there to be any misuse. Thus, there are no false positives to address since the misuse reports are already correct.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
Given that there are no cryptographic API misuses and the reports are already empty, the optimized misuse JSON would be identical to what you've provided:

```json
[]
```

```json
