### False Positive Misuse ###

No false positives were identified in the misuse reports provided. All reported instances of "Insufficient Key Length" are valid as they reference a key length of 16 bits, which is indeed insecure for cryptographic operations.

        "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
        "description": "The key length of 16 bits is insufficient for cryptographic strength, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Secure keys usually require lengths of at least 128 bits.",
        "recommendation": "Use a key length of at least 128 bits for adequate cryptographic security."
