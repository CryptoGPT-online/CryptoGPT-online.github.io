[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_method": "B4.B4",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C5(\"RC2\");",
    "description": "The code uses the RC2 algorithm, which is a weak and insecure algorithm. RC2 is susceptible to various attacks, including brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace RC2 with a more secure algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_method": "C5.encrypt",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses a key generated with the default algorithm, which may not be sufficiently strong. The key length should be at least 128 bits for symmetric algorithms and 2048 bits for asymmetric algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key generation algorithm, such as `SecureRandom` or a hardware-based random number generator."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
    "vulnerable_method": "C5.encrypt",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded key to encrypt the data. This is insecure because the key is exposed in the code and can be easily obtained by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding cryptographic keys in the code. Instead, use a secure key management system to generate and store the keys."
