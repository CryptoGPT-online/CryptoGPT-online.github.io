After reviewing the provided code and the list of potential cryptographic API misuse, I have identified the following real issues:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) should be random and unpredictable. Using a constant IV as in the code snippet makes the encryption more predictable and susceptible to certain attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the IV."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
        "description": "The key size is not specified, which may result in a weak key if the default size is not adequate for the security context.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly when generating the key to ensure adequate strength, such as AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256."
    }
]
```

The other listed potential misuses regarding the `KeyGenerator` not specifying a secure random source or seed (CWE-330) and the `IvParameterSpec` not being generated using a secure random function (CWE-330) are false positives in this context. The `KeyGenerator` does not require a seed to be specified as it will use a default secure random source, and the `IvParameterSpec` misuse is a duplicate of the first issue since it is directly related to the way the `bytes` array is initialized.
