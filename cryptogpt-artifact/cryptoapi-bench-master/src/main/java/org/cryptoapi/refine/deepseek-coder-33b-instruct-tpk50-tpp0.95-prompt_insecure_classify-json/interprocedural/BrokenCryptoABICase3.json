False Positive Misuse:
---
"misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
"vulnerable_method": "B3.go()"
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);"
"description": "The crypto argument passed to the go method is a hard-coded string 'RC4'. The RC4 algorithm is considered insecure for encryption and should not be used. Instead, strong encryption standards like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) should be used.",
"recommendation": "Replace 'RC4' with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as 'AES'. Ensure that the algorithm is suitable for your specific use-case."

        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm chosen by the program is RC4, which is a weak cryptographic algorithm and has been vulnerable to attacks for a long time. It's now officially considered insecure and should not be used. This could allow attackers to easily decrypt the data.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm like AES, which is currently the most secure option. You can get an instance of a secure random number generator through the 'SecureRandom' class in Java."
