### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the misuse reports are false positives. All reported misuses accurately identify the use of the broken cryptographic algorithm MD2, which is evident in the code through the `MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))` call where `crypto` is initialized from `DEFAULT_CRYPTO`. This signifies the use of MD2 for cryptographic operations, and all misuse reports correctly highlight this insecure practice.
