```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "P6.method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with a byte array containing a single repeated byte value as the seed, which is not cryptographically secure. Attackers may be able to predict future random values generated by `SecureRandom`.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that accepts a sufficiently large and unpredictable seed value, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and avoid using predictable values like a single repeated byte value as the seed."
