### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Weak Key Derivation Function",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The PBEKeySpec is being initialized with a low iteration count (11010) which may result in weak derived keys, making the key easily guessable and susceptible to brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count to strengthen the key derivation function, such as 100,000 or more iterations."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "Using SecureRandom to generate random numbers, but the seed for the PRNG (Pseudo-random number generator) is not set explicitly. It may produce predictable output.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator with proper seed to generate the salt."
