    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Session Key",
    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];",
    "description": "The salt value used for PBKDF2 is only 32 bytes, which is too short. A salt value of at least 64 bytes is recommended.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the size of the salt value to at least 64 bytes."

    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Weak or Insecure Cipher",
    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used without a seed. This can lead to weak or insecure encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator (RNG) with a secure seed."

    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Key Derivation Function with Insufficient Protection Against Guessing Attacks",
    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "`SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();`",
    "description": "The code is using `SecureRandom` without any seed, which makes it susceptible to a variety of attacks, including brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) that is seeded with a strong seed, such as `SecureRandom(new SecureRandom().generateSeed(128))`."

    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "`passedCount = defcount;`",
    "description": "The code is using a hard-coded value (`defcount`) for the number of iterations in the key derivation function. This makes it easy for an attacker to guess the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated value for the number of iterations, and store it securely."

    "description": "The code is using a weak key derivation function (KDF), namely PBEWithMD5AndDES. This KDF is susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF, such as PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 or Argon2."
