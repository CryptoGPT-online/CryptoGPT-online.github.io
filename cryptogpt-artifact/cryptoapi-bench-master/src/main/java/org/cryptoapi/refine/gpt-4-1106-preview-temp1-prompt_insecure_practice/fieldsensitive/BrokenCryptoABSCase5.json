### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Hardcoded Encryption Algorithm" is not a false positive, but the description is misleading. The algorithm is not hardcoded; it is parameterized through the constructor of `C6`. However, the choice of algorithm (IDEA) is insecure.

2. "Improper Error Handling" is a false positive. The `encrypt` method is designed to throw exceptions, and it is the responsibility of the caller to handle these exceptions appropriately. The code provided does not show how exceptions are handled by the caller, so it cannot be determined if there is improper error handling.

3. "Use of static/empty key" is a false positive. The `encrypt` method does not use a static or empty key; it generates a new key for each encryption operation. The empty string in `crypto.encrypt("abc","");` is for the `passedAlgo` parameter, not the key.

4. "Inconsistent use of encryption algorithm" is a false positive. The code uses the same algorithm name for both key generation and cipher operations, which is consistent.

5. "Hardcoded Encryption Key" is a false positive. The key is not hardcoded; it is generated dynamically by the `KeyGenerator`.

6. "Lack of Input Validation" is a false positive. The method checks if `passedAlgo` is empty and uses a default algorithm if it is. This is a form of input validation, although it could be more robust.
