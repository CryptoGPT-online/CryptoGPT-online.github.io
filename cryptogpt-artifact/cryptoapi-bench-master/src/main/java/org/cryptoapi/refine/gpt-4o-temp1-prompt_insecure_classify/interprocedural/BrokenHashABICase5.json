### False Positive Misuse ###

None of the misuse reports provided in the lists are false positives. The code indeed uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which is known to be cryptographically weak and should be replaced with a stronger alternative like SHA-256 or SHA-3. Therefore, all reported misuses are valid and applicable.
