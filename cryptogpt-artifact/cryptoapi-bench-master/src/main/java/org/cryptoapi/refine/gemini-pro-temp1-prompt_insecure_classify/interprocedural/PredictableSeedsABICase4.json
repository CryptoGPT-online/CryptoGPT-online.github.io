  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom(byte[])",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The code uses a seed that is derived from a String, which is not sufficiently random. This can lead to predictable random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as the Java SecureRandom class with a strong seed."
