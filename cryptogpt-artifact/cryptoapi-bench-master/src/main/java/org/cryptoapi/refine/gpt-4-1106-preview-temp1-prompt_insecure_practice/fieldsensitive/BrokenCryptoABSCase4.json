### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Use of Static Key" - This is a false positive because the key is not static; it is generated anew for each encryption operation with `keyGen.generateKey()`.
2. "Use of Default Encoding" - This is a false positive because the code does not show any misuse related to character encoding. The `getBytes()` method is used without specifying an encoding, but this is not directly a cryptographic API misuse.
3. "Use of ECB Mode" - This is a false positive because the code does not explicitly use ECB mode. The misuse is speculative and based on the assumption that the default mode might be ECB, which is not demonstrated in the code.
4. "Missing Initialization Vector (IV)" - This is a false positive because the code does not show the use of any mode that requires an IV. The misuse is speculative and not based on the actual code provided.
5. "Use of Static, Empty or Predictable Key" - This is a false positive because the key is not static, empty, or predictable; it is generated using a `KeyGenerator`.
