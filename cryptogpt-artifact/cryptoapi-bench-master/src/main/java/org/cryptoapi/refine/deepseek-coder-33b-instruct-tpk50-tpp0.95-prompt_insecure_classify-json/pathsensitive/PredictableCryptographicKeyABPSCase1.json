 ### False Positive Misuse ###

    "misuse_category": "Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "P1.main(String [])",
    "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"defaultkey\";\nbyte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();",
    "description": "The default key is hardcoded which makes it easy to guess or discover. This could lead to security vulnerabilities.",

The "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" misuse was removed because it's a false positive. The key is not hardcoded if it's randomly generated or a securely managed value.
