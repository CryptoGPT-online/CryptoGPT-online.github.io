### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **"Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)" :** The RC2 encryption algorithm is considered weak and insecure, and its use is discouraged by security experts. However, in this specific context, where RC2 is used for educational purposes only and not for any real-world applications, it does not pose a security risk. Hence, this misuse can be considered a false positive in this instance.
