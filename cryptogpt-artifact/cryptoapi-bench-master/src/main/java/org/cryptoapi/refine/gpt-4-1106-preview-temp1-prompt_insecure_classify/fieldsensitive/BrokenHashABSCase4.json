### False Positive Misuse ###

- CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  - The method `encrypt` is actually a misnomer since it is not encrypting but rather hashing data using `MessageDigest`. There's no encryption strength to assess because no encryption is happening. Therefore, the reported misuse regarding encryption strength is not applicable.

- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
  - This misuse is reported due to a misconception that the code is encrypting data and should use an IV or salt. However, the code uses a hashing algorithm (MD2), not an encryption algorithm. Hash functions don't require an IV or salt for their primary operation (although salt is used in certain contexts for hash functions, like password hashing, which is not the case here). Since the code is not performing encryption, the concern about randomness (IV or salt) is a false positive.

Given that these items are identified as false positives, they will be removed from the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses.
