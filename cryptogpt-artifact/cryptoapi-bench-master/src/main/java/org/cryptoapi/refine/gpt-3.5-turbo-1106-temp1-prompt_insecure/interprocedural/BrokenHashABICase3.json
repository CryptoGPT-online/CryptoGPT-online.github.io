```json
{
  "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);\nmd.update(str.getBytes());\nSystem.out.println(md.digest());",
  "description": "The code uses the MD4 cryptographic hash function which is known to be broken and insecure. It should not be used for any cryptographic operations.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead of MD4."
},
{
  "misuse": "Unsalted Hash",
  "vulnerable_code": "md.update(str.getBytes());",
  "description": "The 'update' method is called with unsalted input, which can weaken the hash function's security by making it easier for attackers to use precomputed tables to crack the hashed values.",
  "recommendation": "Always use a unique and random salt when hashing sensitive information."
