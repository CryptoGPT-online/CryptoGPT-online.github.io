## False Positive Misuse 
###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "The hardcoded string \"changeit\" is a common weak point in software security. This code snippet includes a hardcoded password, which is an extremely unsafe practice. If this string is leaked, attackers can use it to decrypt the keystore and obtain sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Don't hardcode sensitive information like passwords. Use strong security mechanisms like secure vaults, environment variables, or secure key management systems."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Protocol",
    "vulnerable_code": "URL cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "description": "The code is attempting to load a keystore from a URL, which could expose it to man-in-the-middle attacks. Also, 'https://www.google.com' does not seem to be a valid keystore file.",
    "recommendation": "Only load keystores from a secure source and use a secure transport protocol, such as HTTPS."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Hard-coded key",
    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "Hard-coded keys can make the system more vulnerable to security attacks. It's better to store the key in a secure configuration file or environment variable.",
    "recommendation": "Use secure configuration file or environment variable to store the key."

## Optimized Misuse

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure use of a hard-coded password in cryptographic API",
        "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
        "description": "The code uses a hard-coded password in cryptographic API. This makes the program susceptible to attackers who can potentially obtain the password and use it to access the keystore.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using secure storage to store passwords, preferably in a secure environment such as the user's local system, or via an external service. Never store passwords in plaintext or in source code."
