### False Positive Misuse ###
Based on reviewing the provided code, the misuse described as "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" related to the use of `int keyLength = 16;` can be considered a false positive. The `keyLength` variable is intended as a parameter for a PBEKeySpec, and within the context of PBE (Password-Based Encryption), specifying a "key length" of 16 does not imply a cryptographic key of 16 bits as typically described in AES or other encryption schemes. In this Java context, the key length in PBEKeySpec refers to the desired length for derived keys in bytes (e.g., 128 bits). This can easily be misinterpreted, and since the context suggests cryptographic strength being derived from the password and hash function of the PBE, this specific report doesn't necessarily align with typical cryptographic key length issues.
