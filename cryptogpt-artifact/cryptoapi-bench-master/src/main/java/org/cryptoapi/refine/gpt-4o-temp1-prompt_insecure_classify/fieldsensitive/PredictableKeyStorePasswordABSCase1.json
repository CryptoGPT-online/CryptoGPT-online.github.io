### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.**
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `passedKey = defKey;`
   - **Reason:** This is not a separate misuse; it merely propagates the assignment internally within the class using the already flagged hardcoded credential (`defKey`). The core issue lies with the original hardcoding of the credential, which is already captured as a misuse.
