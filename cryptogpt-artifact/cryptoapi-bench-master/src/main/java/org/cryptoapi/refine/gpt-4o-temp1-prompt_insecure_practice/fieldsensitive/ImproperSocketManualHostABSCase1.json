### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The reported misuse "Use of Default SSL Socket Factory Without Certificate Validation (Potential TrustManager Misconfiguration)" seems redundant when other entries already encompass the issue regarding the use of a default `SSLSocketFactory` without proper certificate validation.
   
2. The "Improper Certificate Validation" reported due to the line `SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();` is essentially representing the same issue across multiple entries, without additional context or value to distinguish them. Therefore, one comprehensive report about the default `SSLSocketFactory` is sufficient.
