### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse:** CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
**Code:** `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));`
**Reason:** The code uses the `KeyGenerator` class to generate a key for the IDEA algorithm. However, the IDEA algorithm is not considered risky as per current knowledge and is still widely used in legacy systems. Therefore, this misuse is a false positive.
