### False Positive Misuse ###

In the provided Java code, the misuse identified is the use of `java.util.Random`, which is flagged as a potential vulnerability due to its insufficiency for cryptographic purposes. However, the context of the code is a simple integer generation for printing, presumably for non-security reasons (e.g., general application logic, simulations, etc.). As no cryptographic application is evident in the given context, the flagged misuse can be considered a false positive if the random generation is not intended for security-sensitive tasks.
