### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Insecure Randomness" reported for `random.nextBytes(salt);` is a false positive. The `SecureRandom` class is designed to provide a cryptographically strong random number generator, and using it to generate a salt is a secure practice. The salt size of 32 bytes (256 bits) is also considered secure for most cryptographic operations, contrary to the claim that it should be at least 64 bits.

2. The misuse "Inadequate Salt Size" reported for `byte[] salt = new byte[32];` is a false positive. A salt size of 32 bytes is generally considered secure and is above the NIST recommendation of at least 64 bits (8 bytes).

3. The misuse "Insecure Random Number Generation" reported for `SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();` is a false positive. The `SecureRandom` class does not require manual seeding in typical use cases, as it automatically seeds itself using system-provided entropy sources.
