Based on the provided Java code, there are no cryptographic API misuses present. The code simply creates a new URL object from a string and prints it to the system output. There are no cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, hashing, or key generation being performed in this code snippet.

Since there are no cryptographic operations, the misuse lists provided are accurate in that they are all empty. Therefore, there is no need to optimize the misuse lists, as they correctly reflect the absence of cryptographic API misuses in the code.

### False Positive Misuse ###
There are no false positives, as the misuse lists are already empty and accurate.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
The misuse JSON does not require optimization as it is already correct in stating that there are no cryptographic API misuses:

```json
[]
```
