### False Positive Misuse ###
- **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength** 
- **Vulnerable Code:** 
```java
private static void go2(){
...
}
```

- **Description**: The misuse report flags the assignment of the default crypto value `RC4` to the `CRYPTO` character array as inadequate encryption strength. However, this assignment does not directly lead to the usage of `RC4` for encryption or key generation. The `go2` method does not perform any cryptographic operations, and the `CRYPTO` array is not used elsewhere in the code.

- **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength** 
- **Vulnerable Code:** 
```java
private static void go3(){
...
}
```

- **Description**: The misuse report flags the assignment of the `CRYPTO` character array to the `crypto` character array as inadequate encryption strength. Similar to the previous case, this assignment does not directly lead to the usage of `RC4` for encryption or key generation. The `go3` method does not perform any cryptographic operations, and the `crypto` array is not used elsewhere in the code.
