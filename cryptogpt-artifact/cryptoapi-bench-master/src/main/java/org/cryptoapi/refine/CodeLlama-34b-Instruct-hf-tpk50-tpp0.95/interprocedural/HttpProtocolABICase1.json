 ### False Positive Misuse JSON ###
[
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Use of Crypto API",
    "vulnerable_code": "go(url);",
    "description": "The method 'go' uses the 'new URL' constructor without specifying the protocol, which can lead to a vulnerability where the code may be redirected to an unexpected URL, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the 'new URL' constructor with a secure version that specifies the protocol, such as 'new URL(protocol, url)', where 'protocol' is a string representing the protocol to use, e.g. 'http' or 'https'."

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
[
  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
    "description": "The URL class is using the default protocol (http) and the default port (80) to create the URL. However, the URL class does not validate the protocol and port, so it is possible to create an invalid URL that could lead to a security vulnerability.",
    "recommendation": "Use a safer and more secure URL creation method, such as `new URL(url, protocol, port)` or `new URL(url, protocol)`."
