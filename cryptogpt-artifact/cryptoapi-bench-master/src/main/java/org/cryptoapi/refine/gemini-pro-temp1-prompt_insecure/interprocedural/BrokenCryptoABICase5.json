[
  {
    "misuse category": "Weak Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-321)",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance()",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto_algo));",
    "description": "The code is using a weak cryptographic algorithm (DES) that is no longer considered secure. Attackers can easily break DES encryption, making it unsuitable for protecting sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Replace DES with a stronger algorithm, such as AES, which is more resistant to attacks and provides a higher level of security."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_method": "none",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
    "description": "The cryptographic key is hard-coded in the source code, making it easily accessible to attackers who can decompile the code. Hard-coded keys are not secure, as they can be easily stolen and used to decrypt encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key management solution, such as a key management service or a hardware security module (HSM), to generate and store cryptographic keys securely."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "Insecure Initialization Vector (CWE-327)",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.init()",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code does not specify an initialization vector (IV) when initializing the cipher. An IV is a random value that is used to ensure that identical plaintext messages produce different ciphertext. Without an IV, an attacker could potentially exploit patterns in the ciphertext to recover the plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV and use it when initializing the cipher. This will help protect against attacks that exploit patterns in the ciphertext."
