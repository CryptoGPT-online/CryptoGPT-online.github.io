 ### False Positive Misuse JSON ###

The following misuses are false positives:

1. "Broken Crypto Algorithm" for "IDEA" algorithm
* The misuse is not applicable because the IDEA algorithm is not used in the provided code.
2. "Insecure Key Derivation" for "Cipher.getInstance(crypto)"
* The misuse is not applicable because the provided code uses a hardcoded string for the cipher algorithm, which is not derived from a user-provided input.
3. "Insecure IV Generation" for "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)"
* The misuse is not applicable because the provided code does not generate an initialization vector (IV) for the encryption.
