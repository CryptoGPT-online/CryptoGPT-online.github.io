### False Positive Misuse ###
The provided code snippet does not show any explicit handling of certificate validation, which means it relies on the default behavior of the `SSLSocketFactory`. The default `SSLSocketFactory` in Java is designed to perform certificate validation against the trust store. Therefore, unless there is evidence that the default trust store has been tampered with or that the default `SSLSocketFactory` has been replaced with a custom implementation that does not perform proper validation, we cannot confirm that there is a misuse.

However, it is important to note that the code does not show any hostname verification, which is a separate step from certificate validation. Hostname verification ensures that the server's hostname matches the hostname in the server's certificate, which is crucial to prevent MITM attacks. The absence of hostname verification could be considered a potential security issue, but it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.
