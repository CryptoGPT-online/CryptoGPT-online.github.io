### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.**  
   - **Reason**: This misuse is valid. DES is indeed considered a weak algorithm.
   
2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.**
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(cryptoKey);`
   - **Reason**: This is a legitimate issue because using `DES`, which has a small key size, does imply inadequate encryption strength.

3. **CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.**
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);`
   - **Reason**: This point is somewhat redundant to the misuse of using DES with ECB mode, which is already covered under CWE-327, related to using a broken cryptographic algorithm. Once an algorithm has been evaluated and noted as insecure, all related implications like weak negotiation are inferred.
