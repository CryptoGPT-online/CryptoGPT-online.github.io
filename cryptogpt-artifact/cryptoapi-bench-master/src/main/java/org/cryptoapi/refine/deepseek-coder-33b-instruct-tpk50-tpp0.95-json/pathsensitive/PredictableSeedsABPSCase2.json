Please note that predictable seeds in SecureRandom in Java are inherently false positives, as the risk of having predictable seeds comes from the use of such values. It's crucial to use a source of randomness for the seed, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed(int numBytes), to ensure the seed is as unpredictable as possible.
