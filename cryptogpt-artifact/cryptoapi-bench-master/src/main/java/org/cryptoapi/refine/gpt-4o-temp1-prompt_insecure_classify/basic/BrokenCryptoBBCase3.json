### False Positive Misuse ###

There are no false positive findings in the misuses reported. The use of the RC4 algorithm in all reported instances is legitimately a misuse due to the algorithm's well-documented vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC4\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\");",
        "description": "The RC4 algorithm is used, which is considered broken and insecure due to vulnerabilities that can lead to weak encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)."
