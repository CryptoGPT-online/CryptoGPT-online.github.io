        "description": "The algorithm used in this code snippet (PBEParameterSpec) requires a salt to make the hash more secure. Using a fixed salt (such as in this example) without generating a new salt for each hash makes it easier to crack the hashes when the same salt is used for multiple hashes. This is a bad practice in cryptography.",
        "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated salt for each hash to ensure the security of your hash functions. In the case of PBEParameterSpec, you can generate a random salt using a SecureRandom instance."

        "description": "The PBE iteration count is set to 1020 which is less than the recommended count of 100,000. This makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks, which could be used to break the encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a higher count value, such as 100,000 or higher, to make the encryption stronger."
