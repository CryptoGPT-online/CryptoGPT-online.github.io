False Positives:

## Misuse 1
{
    "misuse category": "Weak Encryption Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "C4(String)",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C4(\"RC4\");",
    "description": "The misuse is the use of the RC4 encryption algorithm, which is categorically considered insecure and broken. It is no longer recommended for use due to numerous vulnerabilities and attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Update the code to use an AES algorithm or a strong encryption algorithm instead."
}

## Misuse 2
{
    "misuse category": "Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "C4.encrypt(String, String)",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The code is using the getInstance() method of the Cipher class to create a cipher. It is not necessary to instantiate the Cipher directly using this method. The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) should automatically provide the most secure and efficient Cipher for the given transformation.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the call to Cipher.getInstance(). The cipher can be securely initialized directly with the KeyGenerator.generateKey() method and the Cipher.init() method."
}

## Misuse 3
{
    "misuse category": "Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "C4.encrypt(String, String)",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The code is using the getInstance() method of the Cipher class to create a cipher. The RC4 encryption algorithm is known for its low strength and should not be used in new applications. It's also vulnerable to several cryptographic attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Update the code to use an AES algorithm or a stronger encryption algorithm, considering its better strength, resistance to numerous attacks, and compatibility across different platforms."
