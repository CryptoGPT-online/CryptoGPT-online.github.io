### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-650: Use of Incorrect Cryptographic Algorithm
**Vulnerable Code:** `crypto.method1("");`
**Description:** The code uses an empty string as the input to the `method1()` method, which is likely not the intended behavior and could lead to incorrect encryption or decryption.
**Recommendation:** Ensure that the input to the `method1()` method is a valid URL.

**Explanation:** This misuse is a false positive. The code is not using an incorrect cryptographic algorithm. It is simply passing an empty string as the input to the `method1()` method. This is not a security issue.

2. **Misuse:** CWE-760: Insufficient Use of Cryptographic Protection
**Vulnerable Code:** `public void method1(String passedURL) throws MalformedURLException {if(passedURL.isEmpty()){passedURL = defURL;}},`
**Description:** The code switches to using a default URL if the passed URL is empty, without any validation. This could allow an attacker to specify a malicious URL as the default, which would then be used by the code.
**Recommendation:** Validate the passed URL before using it, or use a safer default URL if the passed URL is empty.

**Explanation:** This misuse is a false positive. The code is not using insufficient cryptographic protection. It is simply switching to using a default URL if the passed URL is empty. This is not a security issue.
