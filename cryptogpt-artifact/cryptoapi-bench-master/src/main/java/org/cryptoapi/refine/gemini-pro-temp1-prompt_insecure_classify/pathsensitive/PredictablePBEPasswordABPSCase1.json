### False Positive Misuse: ###

- `"misuse": "CWE-326: Use of Insufficiently Random Values."`
  - The misuse category is CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
  - The vulnerable code is `SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();`
  - The description is "The code uses the default `SecureRandom` constructor, which is not cryptographically secure."
  - The recommendation is "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator such as `java.security.SecureRandom`."
