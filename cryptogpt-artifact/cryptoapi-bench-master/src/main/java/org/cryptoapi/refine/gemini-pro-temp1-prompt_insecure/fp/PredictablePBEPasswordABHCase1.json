    "description": "The code uses a weak key derivation function (KDF), PBEKeySpec, which is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF such as PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 or bcrypt with a high iteration count (e.g., 100,000 or more) to strengthen the key derivation process."

    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) such as SecureRandom(byte[] seed) or SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to generate unpredictable and strong randomness."
