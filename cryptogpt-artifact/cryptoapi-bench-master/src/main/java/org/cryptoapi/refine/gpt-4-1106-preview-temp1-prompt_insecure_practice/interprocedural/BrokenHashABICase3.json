### False Positive Misuse ###

After reviewing the provided code and misuse lists, it appears that all the reported misuses are indeed valid concerns and not false positives. The use of MD4 is a known security risk due to its cryptographic weaknesses. Additionally, the lack of explicit character encoding when converting strings to bytes and the improper output encoding of the digest are legitimate issues that should be addressed.
