### False Positive Misuse ###

- CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials - The key is created based on a randomly generated `ints()` stream, hence it is not hardcoded in the traditional sense of the term; the key material is derived from a non-deterministic source (i.e., `SecureRandom`). This differs from hardcoded credentials, which are often static and never change. Hence, both instances of CWE-798 in the lists are false positives.
