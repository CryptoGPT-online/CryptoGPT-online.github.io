### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Default value in HashMap" - This misuse is a false positive because the code does not demonstrate any accidental logging or printing of the HashMap. While it is generally good practice to handle cryptographic materials with care, the misuse is speculative without evidence of such a leak.

2. "Insecure cryptographic operation" - This misuse is a false positive because the code does not specify which cryptographic operation is being used. Without knowing the algorithm, it is not possible to determine if it is insecure. The misuse is based on an assumption rather than the actual usage in the code.

3. "Hardcoded Salt" - This misuse is a false positive because the salt is not hardcoded in the traditional sense; it is derived from a value in a HashMap. However, the salt is indeed too short and not random, which is a valid concern but not for the reason stated.

4. "Predictable Salt" - This misuse is a false positive because the salt is not predictable in the context of the code provided. The salt is derived from a value in a HashMap, which could be considered insufficiently random, but not necessarily predictable.

5. "Insecure Map Key Usage" - This misuse is a false positive because the keys in the HashMap are not used for cryptographic operations. They are simply used to retrieve a byte value for the salt.

6. "Prohibited Boxed Primitive Constructor" - This misuse is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse. While it is a Java best practice to avoid using constructors for boxed primitives, it is not a cryptographic API misuse.
