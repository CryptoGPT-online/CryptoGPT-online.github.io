[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "S1.go",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\n        byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();\n\n        if(choice>1){\n            bytes = new byte[16];\n            sr.nextBytes(bytes);\n        }",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a 16-byte initialization vector (IV) only when `choice` is greater than 1. This means that the IV is constant for all encryptions when `choice` is 1 or less, which can make the cipher vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a new IV for each encryption using a cryptographically secure random number generator."
