    "description": "The MessageDigest algorithm is initialized with a String value obtained from the 'crypto' variable, which is derived from the hard-coded 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO' value. This approach is insecure because it allows an attacker to specify the algorithm to be used, potentially leading to the use of a weak or compromised algorithm.",

    "description": "The code is using MD5 for hashing, which is no longer considered secure and should not be used for any cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
