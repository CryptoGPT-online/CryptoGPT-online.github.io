### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**  
   - **Reason**: The SecureRandom class is initialized, which is standard practice for generating sufficiently random values in Java. The suggestion to use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` is not necessary unless there's specific evidence that the platform's SecureRandom is inadequate. Hence, this is a false positive in the context of the given code.
