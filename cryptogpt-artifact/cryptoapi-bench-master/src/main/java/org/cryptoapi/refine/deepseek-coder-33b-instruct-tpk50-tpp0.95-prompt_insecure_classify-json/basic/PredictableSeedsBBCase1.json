Based on the provided misuses list and code, it seems that only the last reported misuse is a false positive, because in this case the seed is not completely random but a specific byte array, which is hardcoded. This is a common mistake because it makes the generated sequence predictable, which may cause issues in security-sensitive contexts.

Below is the optimized list without false positives:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};\nsr.setSeed(bytes);",
        "description": "The use of a seed with insufficient randomness could lead to predictable results in a security sensitive context.",
        "recommendation": "When using a seed for a secure random number generator, use a secure source of randomness. For example, java.security.SecureRandom provides a seed that is secure enough for most purposes."
    }
]
```
