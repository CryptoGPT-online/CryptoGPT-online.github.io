### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - Explanation: This issue is not applicable in this context for the misuse of `SecureRandom`. CWE-326 generally implies using inadequate encryption schemes or keys; here, the concern should focus on the predictability of the seed affecting randomness, not encryption strength.
