  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses MD2 to perform message digest. However, MD2 is a weak hashing algorithm that is no longer considered secure. Its resistance to brute-force attacks is low and it is vulnerable to collision attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD2 with a stronger hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-512."
