### False Positive Misuse ###

Upon reviewing the provided code and associated misuse reports, I've determined that all reported misuses are indeed applicable and are not false positives. Therefore, there are no false positive misuses to remove. Each misuse is clearly based on the code:

1. The use of a fixed value from a `HashMap` as an IV is predictable and violates `CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values`.
2. Not specifying the key size in the `KeyGenerator` could result in a weaker encryption strength (`CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength`).
3. Not using a secure random instance for the key generation could potentially lead to using a less secure source of randomness (`CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values`).

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

Given that there are no false positives, the optimized misuse list is the same as the original provided list, combining similar misuse entries for conciseness and avoiding redundancy. Here is the combined JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": [
            "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
            "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");"
        ],
        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is derived from a fixed string in a HashMap, which is predictable and not secure. Additionally, the code does not explicitly specify a secure random instance for the key generation, which can lead to a less secure source of randomness.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation and specify a secure random instance when generating the encryption key."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
        "description": "The key generator does not specify the key size for AES, potentially resulting in a weaker default key size.",
        "recommendation": "Specify a key size when generating the key, such as using keyGen.init(256) for a 256-bit key, which is considered strong."
    }
