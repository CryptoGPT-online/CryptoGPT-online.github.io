### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Misuse related to key length (CWE-326):
   Multiple entries suggest that a key length of 16 bits or 16 bytes is being used. However, this is a misunderstanding because the `keyLength` variable in the code represents the key size in bytes, and since each byte has 8 bits, the actual key length being used is 128 bits (= 16 bytes * 8 bits/byte), which is a standard and secure key length for many encryption algorithms, including AES.

2. Misuse related to the use of `SecureRandom` (CWE-330):
   The code provided properly uses `SecureRandom` to generate a salt, which is a best practice for cryptographic operations. The misuse description mentions concerns about seeding, but modern implementations of `SecureRandom` handle seeding automatically and securely, making manual seeding unnecessary for most use cases. Since there's no apparent misuse in how `SecureRandom` is used, the report related to CWE-330 is a false positive.
