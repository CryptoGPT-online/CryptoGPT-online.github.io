 Here is the JSON response with the false positive misuses removed:

[
  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
    "description": "The code is using a broken crypto algorithm (MD5) for cryptographic operations. This algorithm is known to be insecure and should not be used for any security-related operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure crypto algorithm such as SHA-256 instead."
  }
]

The optimized misuse JSON only includes the misuse report that is not a false positive, which is the "Broken Crypto Algorithm" misuse. The recommendation is to use a secure crypto algorithm such as SHA-256 instead of the broken algorithm MD5.
