### False Positive Misuses ###
The misuse 'CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values' is not related to the cryptography misuse, and thus can be treated as a false positive. This misuse concern about generating random values correctly and using truly random data, which is important, but does not indicate a weak cryptographic algorithm.
