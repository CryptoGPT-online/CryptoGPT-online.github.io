### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation" found in the `checkClientTrusted(...)` method is actually not a false positive. This code bypasses SSL/TLS certificate validation by trusting any client connecting without certificate validation. This could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
