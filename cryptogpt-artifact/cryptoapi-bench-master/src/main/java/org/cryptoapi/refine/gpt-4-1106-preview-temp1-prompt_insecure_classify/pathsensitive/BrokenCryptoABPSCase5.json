### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**

There are two mentions of this misuse related to `keyGen.generateKey()` suggesting that KeyGenerator is not initialized with a secure random seed. However, in Java, when a `KeyGenerator` instance is created through the `getInstance` method, it is automatically initialized with a system-provided source of randomness unless otherwise specified by the caller. Therefore, this specific call does not explicitly constitute a misuse provided the underlying platform provides a secure source of randomness, which is generally the case for modern platforms. Since the code does not show evidence of the security quality of the random number generator (like using a weak or predictable seed), considering it a misuse might be premature.

2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**

The misuse reports that mention not specifying the key size for AES may result in an insufficiently strong key are somewhat misleading. While it is considered best practice to specify key size, the default key size (128 bits for AES) is generally considered adequately secure for many applications. However, if the security standards of the application require it, a larger key size should be used. 

3. **CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation**

The control flow does allow the choice of algorithm to change based on the `choice` variable, however, since both `IDEA` and `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding` are not selected in negotiation with an external party and the code does not suggest an adversary can control this choice directly (the choice is internally set in the `main` function), this is not an instance of CWE-757.
