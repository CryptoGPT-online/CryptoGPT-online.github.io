        "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm, which is a symmetric block cipher. AES is widely used but it has a key size of 128 bits, which is considered sufficient for most applications. However, a 128 bit key is considered to be too short and less secure than a 192 or 256 bit key. This might result in less resistance to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a larger key size. For instance, you can use a 256-bit AES key or a different algorithm such as RSA."
