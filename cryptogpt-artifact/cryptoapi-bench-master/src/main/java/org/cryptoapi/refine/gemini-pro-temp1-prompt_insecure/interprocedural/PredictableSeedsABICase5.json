    "vulnerable_method": "method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The seed value used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is inadequate, as it is a short byte array and does not provide sufficient entropy. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and long seed value to initialize the SecureRandom instance. One way to do this is to use the SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() method."

    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
    "description": "The seed used for the SecureRandom object is not sufficiently random, as it is generated from a small set of fixed values. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the SecureRandom object, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating the seed for the SecureRandom object, such as using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) or obtaining the seed from a trusted source."

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The seed value for the `SecureRandom` instance is generated from a small number of bytes, which may not be sufficient to ensure randomness. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger seed value, such as one generated from a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). Java provides the `SecureRandom` class for this purpose."

    "vulnerable_method": "method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with a weak seed, which could lead to predictable and insecure random numbers. In this case, the seed is simply a byte array that can be easily guessed or manipulated, making it insecure for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed for the `SecureRandom` class, such as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or a hardware random number generator (HRNG)."

    "misuse category": "Inadequate Seeding of Random Number Generator",
    "vulnerable_method": "method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `seed` variable is not properly initialized, which can lead to predictable random number generation. This can be exploited to compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and seed it with a high-quality random seed. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to get a CSPRNG and `SecureRandom.generateSeed(int numBytes)` to generate a high-quality random seed."
