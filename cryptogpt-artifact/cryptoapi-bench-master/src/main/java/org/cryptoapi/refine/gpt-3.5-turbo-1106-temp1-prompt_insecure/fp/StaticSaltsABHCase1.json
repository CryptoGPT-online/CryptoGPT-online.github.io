    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec is being initialized with a static and hard-coded salt and low iteration count. Using static and hard-coded values for salt and a low iteration count reduces the strength of the encryption and makes it more vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a unique salt for each encryption, and to use a high iteration count (e.g., at least 10,000) to increase the computational cost of the encryption process."
