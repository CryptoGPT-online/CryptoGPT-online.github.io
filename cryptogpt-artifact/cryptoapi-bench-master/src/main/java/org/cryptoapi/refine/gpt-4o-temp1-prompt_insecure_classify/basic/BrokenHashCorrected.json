The provided Java code does not contain any specific misuse reports in the section marked "---misuse lists begin--- [][] [] [] []---misuse lists end---". This implies that no particular misuses have been identified, or it has been omitted.

In the absence of explicit misuse data, there are no false positives to analyze, nor any to optimize. However, let's assume there were some misuse reports, and I'll provide guidance based on common false positives often associated with such scenarios.

### False Positive Misuse ###
- Instantiating `MessageDigest` with `"SHA-256"`: This is considered a secure and standard hashing algorithm for creating a message digest, and therefore should not be flagged as misuse unless further context about insecure use is provided.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
{
  "misuses": []
}
```

If there are specific misuse reports you intended to include, please provide them, and I will re-evaluate the response accordingly.
