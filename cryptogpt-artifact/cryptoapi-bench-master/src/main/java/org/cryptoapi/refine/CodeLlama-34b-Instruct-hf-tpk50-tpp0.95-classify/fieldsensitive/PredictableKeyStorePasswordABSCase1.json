### False Positive Misuse ###

The following misuses are false positives and should be removed from the JSON list: * CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
* CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials

These misuses are not applicable in this context because they are related to randomness and hardcoded credentials, but they do not affect the vulnerability of the code.
