### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. The code indeed uses AES with ECB mode, which is a known security risk due to its lack of semantic security. Therefore, all misuse reports are valid.

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "The use of AES in ECB mode is insecure because it does not provide semantic security. Identical plaintext blocks will encrypt to identical ciphertext blocks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher mode, such as AES in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) or CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with a random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation."
