### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
2. Weak Key Derivation Function (KDF) with a low iteration count

**Reason for False Positives:**

Both misuses are false positives because the context is missing. The code creates a PBEParameterSpec object, which is used to initialize a PBE cipher. The PBE cipher is used to encrypt data, and the PBEParameterSpec object specifies the parameters used to generate the encryption key.

The salt and iteration count specified in the code are not weak. The salt is 1 byte long, which is the minimum size for a salt, and the iteration count is 1020, which is a reasonable value.
