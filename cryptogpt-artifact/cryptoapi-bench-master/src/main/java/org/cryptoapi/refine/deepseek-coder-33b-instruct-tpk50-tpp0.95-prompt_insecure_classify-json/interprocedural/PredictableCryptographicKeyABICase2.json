False Positive Misuse:
[

    "misuse category": "Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "P2.go()",
    "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();",
    "description": "The AES encryption algorithm is commonly used but with the right keys, any encryption can be broken. In this code, the encryption key is very weak because it's only 11 characters long, which is very short for the AES-128 encryption. AES-128 requires a 16 byte (128 bit) encryption key, but the current key is only 11 characters long which means that the strength of the encryption is weakened.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a longer key for the AES encryption. You could use a key that is derived from a password and a salt using a secure algorithm such as PBKDF2."

Optimized Misuse JSON:

    "vulnerable_method": "P2.go()",
    "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16); SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",

Explanation:
The misuse of "Inadequate Encryption Strength" reported in the misuse list is a false positive. This misuse is being reported in the same vulnerable code snippet as the previously reported misuse. Therefore, this is considered a false positive because the code already has an inadequate encryption strength. This misuse does not need to be included in the optimized misuse list as the main problem is the inadequate encryption strength rather than the truncation or padding of the encryption key to 16 bytes.
