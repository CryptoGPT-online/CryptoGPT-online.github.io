"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"IDEA\");",
"description": "The `IDEA` algorithm is considered to be broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purposes.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as AES or RSA instead."
}
],
"vulnerabilities": [
{
"vulnerability": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
"description": "The generated key is too weak and can be easily guessed or cracked.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger and longer key, and consider using a key stretching algorithm such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt to make it more resistant to brute force attacks."
