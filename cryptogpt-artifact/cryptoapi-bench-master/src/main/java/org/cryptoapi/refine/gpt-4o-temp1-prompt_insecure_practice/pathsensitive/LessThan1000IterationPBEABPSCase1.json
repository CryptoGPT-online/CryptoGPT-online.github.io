### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Use of Fixed Salt**
   - **Reason**: The salt is actually being generated using `SecureRandom`, which implies that it's not fixed; a new random salt is generated each time. The statement about the fixed-size salt does not imply non-randomness, but merely the allocation of memory, and each execution uses a new salt for key derivation. The concern appears to be misinterpreted because the code is correctly utilizing a random salt.
   
2. **Insecure Salt**
   - **Reason**: The concern about the salt's length is incorrect since it states the salt is a fixed length (32 bytes), which actually exceeds the minimum recommended length (16 bytes). Hence, this should not be considered a misuse as the length is more than adequate for security operations.
