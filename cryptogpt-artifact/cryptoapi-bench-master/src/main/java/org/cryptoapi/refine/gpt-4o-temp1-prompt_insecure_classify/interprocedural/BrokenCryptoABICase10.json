### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. The code plainly uses the IDEA encryption algorithm, which is deprecated and considered insecure by modern standards.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"IDEA\";",
        "description": "The IDEA algorithm is considered outdated and not recommended for use in modern cryptographic applications due to known vulnerabilities and its relatively short key length (128 bits, without room for future upgrades).",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger, modern algorithm such as AES with at least 128-bit keys to ensure better security and compliance with current cryptographic standards."
