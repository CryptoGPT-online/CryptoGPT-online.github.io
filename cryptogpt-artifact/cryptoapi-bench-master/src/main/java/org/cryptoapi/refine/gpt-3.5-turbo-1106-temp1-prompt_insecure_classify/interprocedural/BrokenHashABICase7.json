[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();",
    "description": "The use of hardcoded credentials is considered a security vulnerability as it allows attackers to easily guess or manipulate the credentials. In this code, the DEFAULT_CRYPTO value is hardcoded as 'MD4' and is assigned to the CRYPTO array.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using hardcoded credentials, consider using a secure credential storage such as a keystore or external configuration file to store the cryptographic algorithm information."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses a dynamic string value to determine the cryptographic algorithm to use. However, the value is derived from a static variable which can be controlled by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a fixed, known, and secure cryptographic algorithm."
