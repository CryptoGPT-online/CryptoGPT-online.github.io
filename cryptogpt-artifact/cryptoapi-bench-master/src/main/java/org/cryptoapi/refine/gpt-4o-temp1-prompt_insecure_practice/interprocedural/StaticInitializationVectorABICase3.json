### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** Static Key / Insecure Key Generation / Insecure Randomness for Key Generation
   - **Reason:** The reported misuse about not specifying a key size when initializing `KeyGenerator` or lack of secure randomness is a misunderstanding. The default behavior of Java's `KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")` is to use a reasonably secure default key size, which is typically 128 bits if not explicitly set. However, the main concern in a professional setting would be to explicitly define the key size for clarity and compliance but not inherently insecure without specification. The randomness aspect is managed internally by the JCA using secure defaults.
