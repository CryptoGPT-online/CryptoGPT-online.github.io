### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Key Size Issue / Insufficient Key Size**:  
   The mention that a key size should be specified is valid; however, stating that using a 128-bit key might not be sufficient for strong security is not entirely true. AES-128 is considered secure and is widely used, even though AES-192 and AES-256 provide stronger security for environments requiring enhanced encryption standards.  
   - Remove: "Insufficient Key Size" with description "The key size for AES is not specified, leading to potentially using a 128-bit key, which might not be sufficient for strong security."
   - Remove: "Key Size Issue" with similar reasoning and replace with a more accurate description focusing on specifying the key size for desired encryption strength, but removing the implication that AES-128 is insecure.
