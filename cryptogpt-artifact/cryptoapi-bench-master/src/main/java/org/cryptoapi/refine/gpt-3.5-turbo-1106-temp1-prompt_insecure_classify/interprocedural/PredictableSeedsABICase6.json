    "description": "The program is using a simple byte value as the seed for the SecureRandom object, which is not a strong and unpredictable source of randomness.",

    "description": "The seed for SecureRandom is set to a constant value, which may result in predictable random number generation.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a truly random seed value using a secure source of entropy, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
