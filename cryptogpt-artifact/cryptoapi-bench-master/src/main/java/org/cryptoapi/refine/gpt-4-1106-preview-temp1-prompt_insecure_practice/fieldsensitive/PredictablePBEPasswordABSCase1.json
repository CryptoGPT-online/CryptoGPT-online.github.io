### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Insecure Random Salt Generation" is reported as a misuse due to the creation of a new `SecureRandom` instance every time the method is invoked. However, this is not a misuse because `SecureRandom` is designed to produce a cryptographically strong random sequence. The actual misuse would be not storing or transmitting the salt securely, which is not evident from the provided code.

2. "Insecure Randomness" is reported in multiple instances, suggesting that using `SecureRandom` might not be secure due to the platform's default implementation. This is a false positive because `SecureRandom` is the standard and recommended way to generate cryptographically secure random numbers in Java. Unless there is a known issue with the platform's implementation, this is not a misuse.

3. "Insufficient Entropy (CWE-331)" is reported due to the potential reuse of the salt. However, the code generates a new salt for each operation, which is the correct approach. The misuse would be if the salt is reused across different encryptions, which is not shown in the provided code.
