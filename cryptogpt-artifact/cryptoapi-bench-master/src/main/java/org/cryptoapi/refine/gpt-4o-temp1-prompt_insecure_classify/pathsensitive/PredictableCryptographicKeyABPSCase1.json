### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength with keyBytes adjustment**
   - **Misuse Report**: Misuse related to `keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);`
   - **Reason for False Positive**: The critique regarding adjusting `keyBytes` to 16 bytes using `Arrays.copyOf` is not necessarily a misuse, since the process appears to ensure the length matches AES key sizes which often need to be 128 bits (16 bytes). The critical issue is the randomness and choice of initial bytes, not the adjustment to 16 bytes per se, so this particular adjustment does not inherently weaken security without considering the source of the bytes.

These entries accurately capture the critical elements identified in the code relating to potential security vulnerabilities without unnecessarily flagging non-issues.
