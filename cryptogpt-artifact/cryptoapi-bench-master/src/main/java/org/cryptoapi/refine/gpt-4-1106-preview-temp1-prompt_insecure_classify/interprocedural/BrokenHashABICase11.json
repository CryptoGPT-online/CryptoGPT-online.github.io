### False Positive Misuse ###

Upon reviewing the provided code and misuse reports, all of the misuse reports accurately identify the use of MD4 as a cryptographic vulnerability. As such, there are no false positives to report in this case.

The code explicitly uses the MD4 algorithm, which is well-known to be broken and risky. There's a direct call to `MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)` with the `crypto` variable being set to `"MD4"`, so the misuse reports are valid.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

Since all misuse reports are essentially reporting the same issue, we can consolidate them into a single report and remove the duplicate entries. Here's the optimized JSON representing the misuse:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
        "description": "MD4 is a broken and risky cryptographic hash function that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to several types of attacks which can compromise the integrity of the hashed data.",
        "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
```
