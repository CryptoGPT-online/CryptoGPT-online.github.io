### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-321: Use of Hard-Coded Password**
   - Vulnerable code: `private static final String DEFAULT_SALT = "12345";`
   - Explanation: This misuse is a false positive because the hard-coded string is not being used as a salt for encryption. It is used as a default value for the `SALT` variable, but the `SALT` variable is later assigned to a value generated by `go2()`, which is a secure salt generation method.

2. **CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Sensitive Data in a Memory Buffer**
   - Vulnerable code: `private static char[] SALT;`
   - Explanation: This misuse is a false positive because the `SALT` variable is not used to store sensitive data. It is used to store a salt value, which is not considered sensitive data.

3. **CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Sensitive Data in a Memory Buffer**
   - Vulnerable code: `private static char[] salt;`
   - Explanation: This misuse is a false positive because the `salt` variable is not used to store sensitive data. It is used to store a salt value, which is not considered sensitive data.

4. **CWE-326: Not Using Password Based Encryption (PBE)**
   - Vulnerable code: `PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(salt.toString())}, count);`
   - Explanation: This misuse is a false positive because the code is using PBE with the PBEParameterSpec class.

5. **CWE-547: Use of Constant Key**
   - Vulnerable code: `private static final String DEFAULT_ï‚¶ = "12345";`
   - Explanation: This misuse is a false positive because the code is not using the constant string as an encryption key. It is used as a default value for the `SALT` variable, but the `SALT` variable is later assigned to a value generated by `go2()`, which is a secure salt generation method.
