### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nkeyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();",
    "description": "The code uses random.ints() to generate a random key, which is not a secure way to generate cryptographic keys. The random.ints() method generates pseudo-random numbers, which are not suitable for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure and cryptographically strong random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), to generate key bytes."
