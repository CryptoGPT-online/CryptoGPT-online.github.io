### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: "Hardcoded Cryptographic Key"** from various lists
    - **Reason**: Although the code defines a hardcoded key initially, it is conditionally replaced by a (albeit insecurely generated) random key through `if(choice > 1)`. Therefore, the hardcoded key is not ultimately used if the condition is met.

        "misuse": "Insecure Random Number Generator Usage",
        "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();",
        "description": "The code attempts to generate a secure key using SecureRandom, but incorrectly transforms the random ints to a String before converting to bytes. This does not ensure a secure cryptographic key.",
        "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom.nextBytes() method directly to fill the byte array with random bytes for the cryptographic key."
    },
