        "description": "KeyGenerator.getInstance() uses the default keysize for the given algorithm which may not be secure. The keysize used in the KeyGenerator may be insufficient.",
        "recommendation": "A securely generated key should be used instead of a keysize-based default key. Use a secure random number generator to create your keys. In case of DES, it is recommended to use a key size of 56 bits, not 64."

        "description": "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding does not require an initialization vector. However, ECB mode is not semantically secure for most purposes because it does not hide data patterns well. It is vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks and should not be used without understanding and mitigating these risks.",
