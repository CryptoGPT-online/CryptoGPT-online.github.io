    "description": "The iteration count used in the PBEParameterSpec is too low, which can make it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",

    "description": "The iteration count for password-based encryption is too low, making it easier for attackers to brute-force passwords.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 10,000 to make it more difficult for attackers to crack passwords."

    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "The salt used for password-based encryption is too weak. A weak salt can be easily guessed or brute-forced, which would allow an attacker to recover the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong salt that is at least 16 bytes long and generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator."

    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The code uses PBEParameterSpec with a fixed iteration count, which is insecure. Iteration count should be generated randomly.",
