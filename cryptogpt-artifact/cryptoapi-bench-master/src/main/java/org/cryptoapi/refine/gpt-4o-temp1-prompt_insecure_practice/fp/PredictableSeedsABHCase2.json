### False Positive Misuse ###
There are no false positive misuses in the provided list. All the misuse reports identify the same core issue: setting a predictable and low-entropy seed to a `SecureRandom` instance, making the generated numbers predictable.

        "description": "Using a fixed and predictable seed for SecureRandom makes the random number generation predictable, which can be exploited.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting a seed directly if you don't need reproducible results. If necessary, use a strong, non-predictable seed."
