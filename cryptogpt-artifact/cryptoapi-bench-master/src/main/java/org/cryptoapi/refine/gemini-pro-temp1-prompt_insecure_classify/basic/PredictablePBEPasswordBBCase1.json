  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "P1.key()",
    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
    "description": "The number of iterations for the key derivation function (KDF) is too low. This makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to at least 100,000."

    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length is too short. This makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 256 bits."

    "recommendation": "Ensure that SecureRandom is properly seeded with a strong CSPRNG, such as one provided by /dev/urandom on Linux or CryptGenRandom on Windows."
