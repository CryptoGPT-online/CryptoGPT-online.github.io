### False Positive Misuse ###

In reviewing the reported issues, all the misuse reports pertain to the use of a hardcoded seed with the `SecureRandom` class. Given the provided code snippet, each report correctly identifies the same issue: initializing a `SecureRandom` instance with a fixed seed. This practice is a security vulnerability due to the predictability of random number generation from fixed seeds. Since all reported issues identify the same problem with no variation in the misuse context, there are no false positives to remove.
