### False Positive Misuse ###
```json
{
  "misuse": "Randomness of key generation",
  "vulnerable_method": "B1.go(String, String)",

  "description": "The key generation in this code does not take into account the randomness of keys which can lead to potential security issues.",
  "recommendation": "Consider using SecureRandom for generating random numbers when generating keys."
}
```
The key generator method does not take into account the randomness of keys for security purposes. The code is not in a production environment. It is not being used in a real-world scenario, hence, it is not a false positive. The usage of SecureRandom for key generation is not suggested in real-world applications as it has been shown in many real-world applications that the usage of non-secure random generators leads to predictability in random number generation.
