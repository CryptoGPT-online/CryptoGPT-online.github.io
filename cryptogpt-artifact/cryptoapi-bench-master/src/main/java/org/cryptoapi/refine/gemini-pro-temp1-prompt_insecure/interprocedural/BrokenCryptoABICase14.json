[
  {
    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_method": "B4.method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"RC2\";",
    "description": "The RC2 algorithm is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to various attacks and has been deprecated by modern cryptographic standards.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the use of RC2 with a more secure algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20."
