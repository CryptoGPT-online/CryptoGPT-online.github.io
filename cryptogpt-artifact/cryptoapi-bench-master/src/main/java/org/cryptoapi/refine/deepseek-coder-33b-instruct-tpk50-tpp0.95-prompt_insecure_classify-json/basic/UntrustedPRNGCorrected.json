  {
    "misuse category": "Weak Randomness",

    "vulnerable_code": "int x = random.nextInt();",
    "description": "The `nextInt` method without any arguments returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value across all possible int values. This might not provide high enough entropy for secure uses as it doesn't limit the range of the random numbers generated.",
    "recommendation": "When calling `nextInt` method, specify the range of the generated numbers if the full integer range is not required. For example, if you only want random numbers between 0 and 10, you can use `random.nextInt(11);`"
