{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "RC4",
"description": "The use of the RC4 algorithm is known to be insecure and should not be used in modern cryptographic systems. It has been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including dictionary attacks and attacks that exploit the linear structure of the algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of RC4 with a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as AES."
