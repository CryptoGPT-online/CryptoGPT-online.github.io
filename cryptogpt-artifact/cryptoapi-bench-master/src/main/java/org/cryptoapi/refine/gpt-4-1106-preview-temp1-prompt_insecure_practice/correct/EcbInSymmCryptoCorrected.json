### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Class Name Mismatch" and "ECB Mode Reference in Class Name" are false positives because they are referencing a potential misunderstanding based on the class name. However, the code indicates the use of CBC mode (`Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")`), so this is a non-issue as far as security is concerned; it's just a naming problem.

2. "Incorrect Class Reference" is not a security issue but a potential typo or refactoring error in the code. It's misleading but not related to the cryptographic API misuse.

3. "Insecure Instantiation" suggests concerns over a class that is possibly using ECB mode. It is a potential issue with naming, which can be misleading, but from a security perspective, since the code correctly uses CBC mode as indicated by `getCipherInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")`, this is not applicable.

4. "Class Name Typo" could lead to confusion but does not represent a misuse of the cryptographic API, as the actual instantiation in the main method has no bearing on the cryptographic process.
