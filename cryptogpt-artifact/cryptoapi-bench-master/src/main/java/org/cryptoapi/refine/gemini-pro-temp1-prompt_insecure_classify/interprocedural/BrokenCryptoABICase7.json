1. {
"misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
"vulnerable_code": "`KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));`",
"description": "The code is using a hardcoded cryptographic algorithm (`RC4`) which is considered broken and insecure. RC4 is known to have weaknesses that make it vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20."
}
2. {
"misuse category": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_method": "go2() and go3()",
"vulnerable_code": "```private static void go2(){CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();}\nprivate static void go3(){crypto = CRYPTO;}```",
"description": "The code selects the crypto algorithm dynamically based on user input and defaults to `RC4`, which is a weak and insecure algorithm. An attacker could potentially manipulate the user input to select a weak algorithm, allowing them to decrypt or tamper with sensitive data.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-256, and avoid using hardcoded or user-supplied values for algorithm selection."
