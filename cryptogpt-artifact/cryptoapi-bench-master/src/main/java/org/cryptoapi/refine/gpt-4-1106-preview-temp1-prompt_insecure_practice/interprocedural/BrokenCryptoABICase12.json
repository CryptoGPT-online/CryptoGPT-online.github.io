### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Key Generation without Secure Random" - The misuse list suggests that `keyGen.generateKey();` does not explicitly use a secure random instance. However, in Java, the `KeyGenerator` class is designed to use a secure random source by default. Unless there is a specific requirement or known issue with the default `SecureRandom` implementation on the platform, this is not necessarily a misuse.

2. "Insufficient Error Handling" - The misuse list points out that exceptions are thrown from the `main` method without proper handling. While it is a best practice to handle exceptions appropriately, this is not directly related to cryptographic API misuse. It is more of a general code quality and robustness issue.
