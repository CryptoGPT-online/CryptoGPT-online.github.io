### False Positive Misuse

The provided misuse lists contain potential cryptographic API misuses. However, the analysis of the given context indicates that the following might be false positives:

- "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation" - No certificate validation is needed in this context and an exception will be thrown in the case of an untrusted certificate.
- "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" - The name variable is not used in a cryptographic operation that requires randomness. It's only used as a seed for the hashing.

As for the misuse "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", it is not a false positive. However, since MD4 is considered broken, it's recommended to replace it with a safer algorithm like SHA-256.
