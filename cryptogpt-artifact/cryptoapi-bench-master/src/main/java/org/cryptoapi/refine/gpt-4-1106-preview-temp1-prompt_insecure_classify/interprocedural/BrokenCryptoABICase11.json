### False Positive Misuse ###

The reported misuses regarding the use of "Insufficiently Random Values" (CWE-330) are false positives. In Java, `KeyGenerator.getInstance()` follows the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) which defaults to using a strong source of randomness if none is provided by the caller. A developer can provide their own randomness source using `KeyGenerator.init()`, but the default behavior is secure. The code provided does not show a manual initialization with an insecure random source, so this default secure behavior is likely to be used.
