### False Positives

Based on the code and the provided misuses, there are no false positives. 

1. The misuse regarding the use of the hardcoded, predictable algorithm for 'KeyGenerator' class instance has been correctly identified. The use of hardcoded constants in your application can indeed make it susceptible to attacks. Even if the keys used by the application are properly managed, the choice of the cryptographic algorithm should be done based on their robustness and suitability for the specific task at hand. 

2. The misuse related to the use of a broken or weak cryptographic algorithm is valid and relevant in the Java code snippet provided. The 'DES' and 'DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding' algorithms are indeed considered outdated and insecure, and they should be replaced by more recent, secure alternatives.
