### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Potentially Weak Key with Padding**

   **Reason:** The report mentions that padding or truncating the keyBytes array to 16 bytes may lead to predictable values, but this operation is specifically ensuring the correct byte length for AES, which is 16 bytes. The issue of weak or predictable keys arises from the method of key generation (conversion from an IntStream to a String), not from the byte array truncation/padding itself. This recommendation does not address the core issue of insufficient entropy in the key generation process.
