### False Positive Misuse ###
CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation. The report states that using "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);" with ECB mode is insecure. However, this is already covered by the misuse of using "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding" under CWE-327, making this misuse a duplicate and thereby a false positive.
