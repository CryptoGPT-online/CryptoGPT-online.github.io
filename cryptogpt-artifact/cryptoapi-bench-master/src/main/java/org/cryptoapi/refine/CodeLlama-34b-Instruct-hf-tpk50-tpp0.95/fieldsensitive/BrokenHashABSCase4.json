 ### False Positive Misuses

The following misuses were identified as false positives:

1. "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm" at line 4, column 14: This misuse was identified because the code is using the "MD2" algorithm, which is considered insecure. However, the code is not using MD2 for any cryptographic purpose, so this misuse can be ignored.
2. "Insecure Default Value" at line 8, column 14: This misuse was identified because the code is using the "defCrypto" variable as the default cryptographic algorithm, which is insecure. However, the code is not using defCrypto for any cryptographic purpose, so this misuse can be ignored.
