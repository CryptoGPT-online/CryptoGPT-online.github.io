        "description": "The code uses the AES algorithm, which is not considered broken or risky. However, it is recommended to use stronger algorithms like AES-256 for better security.",
        "recommendation": "Replace \"AES\" with \"AES-256\" to use a stronger encryption algorithm."

        "description": "The code generates AES encryption keys with the default key size, which may be considered insufficient for secure encryption.",

        "description": "The AES algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding is used, which may not provide sufficient encryption strength.",

        "description": "The code uses a static byte array as the Initialization Vector (IV), which can lead to predictable IV values and weaken the security of the encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation."
