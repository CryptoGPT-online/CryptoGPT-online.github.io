### False Positive Misuse ###

In the provided misuse reports, there are no false positives. All the entries indicate the same misuse of using the RC4 algorithm, which is a known security risk. The code indeed uses RC4, and each report correctly identifies this as a misuse due to security vulnerabilities associated with RC4.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

To optimize and merge the duplicate information from the misuse reports, here is a single consolidated JSON object that encapsulates all relevant details:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"RC4\";",
        "description": "RC4 is considered a broken and insecure algorithm due to several vulnerabilities like biases in the keystream that can be exploited, allowing attackers to recover plaintext from ciphertext.",
        "recommendation": "Replace RC4 with a more secure algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)."
    }
]
