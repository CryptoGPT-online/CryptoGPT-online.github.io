"description": "The default key is generated using the default constructor of the SecureRandom class, which uses a random algorithm to generate a key. However, this algorithm is not secure, as it uses a random number generator that is not properly seeded, making it predictable.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key generation algorithm, such as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG), to generate the key. Additionally, use a secure method to convert the random number to a string, such as the toString() method of the BigInteger class."
