    "misuse_category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "SHA-1 is a broken cryptographic hash function that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be used to forge digital signatures and other security-sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
