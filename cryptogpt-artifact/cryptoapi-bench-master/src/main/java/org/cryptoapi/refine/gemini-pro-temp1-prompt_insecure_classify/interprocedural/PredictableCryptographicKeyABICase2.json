  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "P2.go",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = \"defaultkey\";",
    "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded as a string literal, which makes it easy for an attacker to discover and use to decrypt sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding credentials in your code. Instead, use a secure key management system to generate and store encryption keys."
  },

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "P2.go",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The encryption key is derived from a string, which may not be sufficiently random or strong. This could allow an attacker to guess or brute-force the key and decrypt sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a cryptographically strong encryption key. The key should be at least 256 bits long."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "P2.go",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm without specifying the key size. By default, AES is used with a 128-bit key, which is considered insecure. To fix this, the code should explicitly specify the key size, e.g. `AES-256`.",
    "recommendation": "Change `SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");` to `SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES-256\");`"
