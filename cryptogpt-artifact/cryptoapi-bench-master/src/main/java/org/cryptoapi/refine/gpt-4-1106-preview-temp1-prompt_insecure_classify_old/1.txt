../fp/PredictableKeyStorePasswordABHCase1.json:After reviewing the provided code and the list of potential cryptographic API misuse, here is the renewed list of real cryptographic API misuse with false positives removed and corrections made:
../fp/PredictableKeyStorePasswordABHCase1.json:The false positive regarding "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" has been removed because the password is not hardcoded but generated at runtime using `SecureRandom`. However, the method of generation is not secure enough, which is why the "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" misuse still applies. The "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" misuse has been added to address the potential loss of randomness during the conversion of byte arrays to strings. The "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" misuse has been added to address the use of the less secure JKS KeyStore type. The "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation" misuse remains valid as there is no visible certificate validation in the provided code.
../fp/PredictableSeedsABHCase2.json:The misuse identified is not a false positive. The code sets a seed for the `SecureRandom` instance using a byte array that is derived from a hardcoded value (`byte b = hm.get("aaa");`). This value is not only predictable but also repeated to form the seed, which significantly reduces the entropy of the seed. The `SecureRandom` class is designed to produce cryptographically strong random numbers, and manually seeding it with low-entropy or predictable values undermines its strength and security.
../fp/PredictableCryptographicKeyABHCase2.json:The misuse cases are consistent with the original list, and the code snippets associated with each misuse are accurate. The recommendations provided are appropriate for addressing the identified issues. It is important to note that the misuse cases are not false positives; they represent real issues that should be addressed to ensure the security of the cryptographic operations in the code.
../fp/PredictableCryptographicKeyABHCase1.json:The CWE-798 misuse related to hardcoded credentials is a false positive in this context. The character encoding "UTF-8" is a standard encoding and is not related to the cryptographic key or credentials. It is common and recommended to specify the character encoding when converting between bytes and strings to avoid platform-dependent behavior. Therefore, the mention of "UTF-8" does not constitute a misuse in this context.
../fp/PredictablePBEPasswordABHCase2.json:The other concerns listed in the provided misuse lists are either false positives or not applicable based on the given code snippet. For example, the salt length is already 16 bytes, which is sufficient, so the concern about the salt length being inadequate is a false positive.
../fp/PredictableKeyStorePasswordABHCase2.json:After reviewing the provided code and the list of potential cryptographic API misuse, here is the renewed list of real cryptographic API misuse with false positives removed and any additional issues identified:
../fp/PredictableKeyStorePasswordABHCase2.json:The misuse related to "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" for the password retrieved from the hashmap is a false positive. The actual strength of the encryption is not determined by the password length or complexity alone but also by the KeyStore type and the algorithms used. However, the use of JKS as a KeyStore format is a valid concern, as it is less secure than other formats like PKCS12.
