### False Positive Misuse

1. No misuse are marked as false positives as all the reported misuse are present in the provided Java code.

        "description": "A seed of a pseudorandom number generator should ideally come from a secure random number generator to ensure its randomness and security. This code generates a seed by converting a random integer to a string and then back to bytes, which may not produce a secure random seed.",
