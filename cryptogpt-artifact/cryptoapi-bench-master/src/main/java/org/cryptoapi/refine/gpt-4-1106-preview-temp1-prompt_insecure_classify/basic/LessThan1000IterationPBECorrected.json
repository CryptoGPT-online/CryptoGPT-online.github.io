### False Positive Misuse ###

- The misuse related to "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" can be considered a false positive. The code is using `SecureRandom` to generate the salt, which is a cryptographically strong random number generator suitable for this purpose. The size of the salt is 32 bytes (256 bits), which is considered sufficient for cryptographic use and makes it highly unlikely for two salts to be the same. The recommendation does not apply here since we are already ensuring that the salt is generated securely.
