### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse related to "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" is a false positive. The code does hardcode the cryptographic algorithm and padding scheme, but this does not constitute hardcoded credentials. Credentials typically refer to secret information like passwords or keys, not the algorithm or mode used for encryption.
