## False Positive Misuse ##
The misuse category is "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm". This is a false positive because SHA-256 is widely used and considered to be robust and secure enough for most uses. The "vulnerable_method" could be misleading, as the method "MessageDigest.getInstance()" is used regardless of SHA-256 or SHA-1.
