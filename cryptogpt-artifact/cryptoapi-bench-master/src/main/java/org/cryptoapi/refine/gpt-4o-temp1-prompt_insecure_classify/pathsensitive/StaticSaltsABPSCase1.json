### False Positive Misuse ###

None of the reported misuses are false positives. Both issues identified are valid concerns regarding cryptographic strength:

1. **Hardcoded Salt**: The salt is hardcoded and only 1 byte long, which is not secure. Cryptographic best practices recommend a significantly longer salt that should be generated randomly for each encryption operation.

2. **Low Iteration Count**: The iteration count of 1020 is considered low for secure password-based encryption, as modern standards recommend an iteration count of at least 10,000 or more to resist brute-force attacks.
