### False Positive Misuse ###

**CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**:
- The reported misuse indicates that the code uses the default SSLSocketFactory, which may use insecure or outdated cryptographic algorithms. However, the code also specifies TLSv1.2 as the protocol, which is a secure protocol. Therefore, this misuse is a false positive.

**CWE-759: Use of Hard-coded Password**:
- The reported misuse indicates that the code hard-codes the default hostname. However, the hostname is not a password or other sensitive information. Therefore, this misuse is a false positive.
