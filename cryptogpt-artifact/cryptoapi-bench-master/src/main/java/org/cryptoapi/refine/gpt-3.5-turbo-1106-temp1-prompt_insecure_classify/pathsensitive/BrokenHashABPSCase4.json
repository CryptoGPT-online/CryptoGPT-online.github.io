    "description": "The code selects the SHA-256 algorithm only if the choice value is greater than 1. This approach of choosing a cryptographic algorithm based on a variable is not recommended, as it can lead to the selection of weaker algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a condition to select the algorithm, explicitly specify the algorithm to be used, such as MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")."

    "description": "The code updates the MessageDigest with bytes from the 'name' variable, without specifying a salt or any other means of strengthening the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "To enhance encryption strength, consider using a salt or iteration number when updating the MessageDigest. Example: md.update(name.getBytes(), salt, iterations);"
