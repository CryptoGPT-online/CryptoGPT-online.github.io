### False Positive Misuse ###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
        "description": "The AES key is generated using KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\").generateKey(). This is not considered a secure way to generate keys, as not all KeyGenerator implementations generate secure keys. The KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\") call might not be secure.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a secure key generation process, such as using a SecureRandom instance to generate the key directly."
    }
]
```

This misuse is a false positive because the KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES") call generates a secure key according to the JavaDoc. The SecureRandom class documentation also suggests that this class provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG).

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The use of the AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding cipher is considered insecure due to its use of ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode. ECB mode does not include any form of encryption sequencing. It does not hide patterns. It's easy to encrypt several identical plain texts and thus makes the encrypted text identical as well. This is very risky because it allows an attacker to infer some information about the original plaintext based on patterns in the encrypted text.",
        "recommendation": "Do not use AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding. Instead, use a secure mode like AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding (Cipher Block Chaining)."
    },

        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The crypto parameter is passed directly from the user without validation, so it is possible to use weak or broken cryptography.",
        "recommendation": "Before creating a Cipher instance, validate the crypto parameter and check that it is a secure and valid algorithm."
