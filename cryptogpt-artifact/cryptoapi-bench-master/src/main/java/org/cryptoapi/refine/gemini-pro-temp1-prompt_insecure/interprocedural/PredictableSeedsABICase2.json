    "description": "Using a single byte as the seed for `SecureRandom` is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. This can lead to predictable or guessable random numbers, which can compromise the security of applications that rely on them.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is seeded with a strong source of entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a larger seed size to increase the unpredictability of the generated random numbers."
