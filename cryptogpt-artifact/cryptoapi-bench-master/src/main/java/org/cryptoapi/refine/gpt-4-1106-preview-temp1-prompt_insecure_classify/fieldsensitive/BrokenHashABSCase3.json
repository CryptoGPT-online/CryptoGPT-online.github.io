### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Misuses related to "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" are false positives. The `MessageDigest` class is used for hashing, not encryption. Therefore, any report that complains about encryption strength in the context of hashing is not applicable.

2. The reference to "Use of Insufficiently Random Values" (CWE-330) is a false positive in this particular context since the `MessageDigest` class is being used for creating hash digests, and salts are generally not used in such contexts. However, the use of salts is applicable when storing passwords, for which cryptographic hash functions like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt are recommended.
