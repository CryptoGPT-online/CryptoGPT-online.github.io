### False Positive Misuse ###

After reviewing the provided Java code, it is evident that this code does not contain any cryptographic API usages. The code simply defines a `Hd` class with a `main` method that creates a `URL` object from a string and prints it to the system output. There are no cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, hashing, or any other operations that involve cryptographic keys or cryptography-related libraries.

Because there are no cryptographic APIs being used in this code snippet, there can't be any cryptographic API misuses. Therefore, all the reported misuses provided in the JSON format (which happen to be empty lists) are false positives as they do not correspond to any actual misuse.
