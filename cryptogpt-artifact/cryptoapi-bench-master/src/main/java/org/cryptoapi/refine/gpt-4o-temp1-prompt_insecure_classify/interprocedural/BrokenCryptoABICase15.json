### False Positive Misuse ###
There are no false positives in the reported misuses. Each misuse correctly points out the use of the outdated and less secure IDEA cryptographic algorithm.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"IDEA\";",
        "description": "The code uses the IDEA cryptographic algorithm, which is considered to be outdated and less secure than modern algorithms. IDEA is not recommended for use in new systems due to known vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for better security."
