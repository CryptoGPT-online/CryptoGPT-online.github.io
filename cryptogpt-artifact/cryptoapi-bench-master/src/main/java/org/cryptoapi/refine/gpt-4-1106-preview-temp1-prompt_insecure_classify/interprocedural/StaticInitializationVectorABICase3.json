### False Positive Misuse ###

Upon review of the given code and the misuse lists provided, all of the listed misuses are applicable. The IV used is derived from a hardcoded string which is indeed both non-random and of inadequate length ("abcde" is 5 bytes, while AES requires a 16-byte IV), and without specifying the key size for the AES KeyGenerator, it could default to a lower strength key considered insufficient by today's standards.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

The following JSON compiles the misuse reports without redundancy:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
        "description": "The IV (Initialization Vector) should be random and unpredictable. Using a predictable IV such as 'abcde' can allow attackers to mount successful attacks on the encryption algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random generator to generate the IV."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
        "description": "The encryption strength is inadequate because the key size for AES is not specified. Without setting an explicit key size, the KeyGenerator may resort to using a default of 128 bits, which might not be adequate for some security requirements.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly by using keyGen.init(256); or the appropriate key size required."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values & CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
        "description": "Using a hardcoded string 'abcde' as the IV is not sufficiently random and predictable, making the encryption vulnerable. Furthermore, as the IV forms part of the cryptographic parameters, using a hardcoded value is also a form of hardcoded credentials, which is insecure.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to produce the IV and avoid hardcoded cryptographic parameters."
    }
]
``` 

This optimized misuse JSON list includes the most critical issues from the original lists without repetition of similar issues. It encompasses both the concerns related to the IV and the unspecified key size, as well as noting that the hardcoded 'abcde' string could be seen as a use of hardcoded credentials which is another aspect of the CWE-330 misuse.
