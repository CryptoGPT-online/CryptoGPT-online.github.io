### False Positive Misuse ###

- The misuse related to "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" where "int keyLength = 16;" is cited, is a false positive. The variable `keyLength` in this context represents the length of the key in bytes, not bits. Thus, `keyLength = 16` corresponds to a 128-bit key, which is generally considered secure. The reports have misunderstood this as 16 bits, which would be insecure. Therefore, these misuse instances can be omitted.
