### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength (first instance)** - This misuse describes the use of a hardcoded default key as failing to provide adequate encryption strength. The description under this item is partially correct but categorizes it under the wrong CWE. The actual problem is using a hardcoded credential, which should be a separate misuse under CWE-798. We will adjust this misuse type accordingly in the optimized misuse list.

2. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials (second instance referencing `String passKey = P1.getKey("pass.key");`)** - The process of retrieving configuration properties (such as keys) through system properties is not inherently a misuse; itâ€™s a common technique for configuration flexibility. While it could lead to issues if the configuration is improperly managed, it does not constitute a hardcoded credential misuse.
