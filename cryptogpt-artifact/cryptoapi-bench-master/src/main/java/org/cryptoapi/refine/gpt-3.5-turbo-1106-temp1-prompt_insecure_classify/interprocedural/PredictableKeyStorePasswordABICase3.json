    "description": "The code is using a weak encryption algorithm (JKS) with a low encryption strength. Additionally, the key used for encryption is a hardcoded value.",
    "recommendation": "Use stronger encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) with recommended key sizes. Avoid using hardcoded keys, instead, store them securely or use dynamically generated keys."

    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "The code is using a hardcoded password for the encryption process. Hardcoded passwords are insecure because they can be easily discovered and exploited.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded passwords. Use secure mechanisms to store and retrieve passwords, such as using environment variables or reading from a secure configuration file."

    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
    "description": "The code is using the default Java cryptographic algorithm, which may not provide sufficient security for sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES or RSA."
