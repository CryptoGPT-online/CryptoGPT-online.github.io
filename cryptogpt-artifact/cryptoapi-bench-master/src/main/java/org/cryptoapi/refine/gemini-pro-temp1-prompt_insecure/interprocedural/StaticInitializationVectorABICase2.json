    "misuse category": "Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "Using the default key size for AES algorithm, which may not provide sufficient security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 256 bits, by specifying it in the `KeyGenerator`."

    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "Using the CBC mode with PKCS5Padding may be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a different mode of operation, such as Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), which is less susceptible to padding oracle attacks."

    "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(String.valueOf(initialization))});",
    "description": "The code is using a key-derivation function (KDF) with insufficient entropy. The KDF is used to generate an initialization vector (IV) for the cipher. The IV is a random value that is used to initialize the cipher. If the IV is not random enough, it can be guessed by an attacker, which would allow them to decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to generate the IV. The KDF should be used with a strong password or passphrase."

  {
    "misuse category": "Use of Hard-Coded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "DEFAULT_INITIALIZATION",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static final String DEFAULT_INITIALIZATION = \"abcde\"",
    "description": "The code is using a hard-coded initialization vector. This is a security risk because an attacker could guess the IV and decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the IV randomly at runtime. For example, you could use the `SecureRandom` class to generate a random IV."
