### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
    "description": "The code uses the RC2 algorithm for key generation and encryption, which is considered broken and insecure. It is vulnerable to various attacks and should not be used.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the use of RC2 with a stronger symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES."
