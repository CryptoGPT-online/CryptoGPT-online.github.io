### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Hardcoded Cryptographic Algorithm:**
   - **Misused Reported:** defaultAlgo = defAlgo;
   - **Reason:** In the current context, the code does not have a hardcoded weak algorithm that will always execute. It dynamically chooses a value, which might indeed be weak (RC2), but the issue here is primarily the weak algorithm and not the act of hardcoding.

[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C5(\"RC2\");",
        "description": "RC2 is considered a weak encryption algorithm and should not be used due to vulnerabilities that allow it to be broken by attackers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Modify the C5 constructor to accept a defaultAlgo that uses a secure algorithm like AES."
    },

        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
        "description": "Not explicitly setting the key size can lead to insufficient security, especially when default key sizes are small. RC2 key sizes are often not strong enough for modern security.",
        "recommendation": "Specify an adequate key size explicitly when initializing the KeyGenerator, particularly for algorithms like AES use 128, 192, or 256 bits."
