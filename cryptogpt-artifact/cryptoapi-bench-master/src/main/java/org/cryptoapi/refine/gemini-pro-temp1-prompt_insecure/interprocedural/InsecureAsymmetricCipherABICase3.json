    "vulnerable_code": "int keySize = k;\nmethod1(keySize);",
    "description": "The key size of 1024 bits is considered weak and insecure by today's standards. Attackers can use brute-force attacks to crack weak keys relatively easily. A key size of at least 2048 bits is recommended for RSA encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to a more secure value, such as 2048 bits or higher."

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");",
    "description": "RSA is a legacy algorithm that has known vulnerabilities and is no longer considered secure for most applications. A more modern and secure algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305, should be used instead.",
    "recommendation": "Replace RSA with a more secure algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
