## False Positive Misuse:

None of the misuse categories in the given lists are false positives. All the reported misuses are real and need to be fixed.

        "description": "AES is a block cipher and the key length must be 128 bits (16 bytes). Your code is using a 16 bytes key but the algorithm might not be the best fit for your use case. An AES key size of 128 bits is too short for modern encryption requirements, and using a weak key length could potentially leave your data vulnerable to brute force attacks. Also, this piece of code is directly using a key derived from a hardcoded string which is also a potential security risk.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a secure key derivation function (KDF) to derive a strong key from a user-supplied password or use a cryptographic random number generator to generate a secure random key. If using a secure KDF, it is also recommended to use a key size that is supported by the KDF (e.g. 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits for AES)."

        "description": "This code generates a random AES key, which is secure against brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks.",
        "recommendation": "In production code, always use a secure and properly seeded random number generator for generating secret keys, such as SecureRandom in Java. It should never be replaced with `new Random()`, which is not secure. Also, the size of the generated key is not dependent on the input key, which might be a security risk."
