### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Information Leakage" misuse related to `private static char[] HOST_NAME;` is a false positive. The `HOST_NAME` field is not storing sensitive data; it's storing a default hostname which is not inherently sensitive. This is not a security risk unless the hostname itself is sensitive, which is not indicated by the provided context.

2. "Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209)" misuse is a false positive. The provided code does not show any error handling or logging, so we cannot determine if there is any information exposure. The misuse is speculative without additional context.

3. "Improper Output Neutralization for Logs (CWE-117)" misuse is a false positive. The code does not show any logging or output generation using `hostName.toString()`. Without evidence of logging, we cannot confirm this misuse.

4. "Ineffective Conversion (CWE-704)" and "Type Confusion in hostname Conversion" misuses are essentially the same issue, reported with different descriptions. They both refer to the incorrect use of `hostName.toString()` to convert a char array to a String.
