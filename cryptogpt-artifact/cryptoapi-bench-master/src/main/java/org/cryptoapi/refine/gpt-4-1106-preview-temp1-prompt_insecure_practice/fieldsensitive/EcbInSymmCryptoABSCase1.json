### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Missing Initialization Vector" and "Static Initialization Vector (IV)" are false positives in the context of ECB mode, as ECB does not use an IV. However, the recommendation to avoid ECB mode is valid.

2. "Insecure Key Generation" and "Weak Key Generation" are false positives if the default key size used by the `KeyGenerator` is 128 bits or higher, which is considered secure for AES. However, it is still a best practice to explicitly set the key size.

3. "Lack of Secure Random Source" is a false positive because `KeyGenerator` is designed to use a secure random source by default for key generation. Explicitly setting a `SecureRandom` instance is not necessary unless there is a specific requirement to do so.
