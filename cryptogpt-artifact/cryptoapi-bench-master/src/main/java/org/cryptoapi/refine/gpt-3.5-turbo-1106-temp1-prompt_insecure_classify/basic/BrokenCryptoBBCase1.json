    "description": "The code is using the DES algorithm for encryption, which is considered insecure and broken. Additionally, it is using ECB mode and PKCS5Padding, which are also insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Replace DES with a more secure encryption algorithm like AES. Also, use a secure mode of operation like CBC and a secure padding scheme like PKCS7Padding."
