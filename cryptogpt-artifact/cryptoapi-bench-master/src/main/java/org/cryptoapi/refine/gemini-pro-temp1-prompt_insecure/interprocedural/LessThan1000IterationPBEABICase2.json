### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Entropy for Random Number Generation**
   - **Vulnerable code:** `SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();`
   - **Reason:** The `SecureRandom` class is properly seeded with a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) via `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`.

2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - **Vulnerable code:** `PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);`
   - **Reason:** The encryption algorithm (PBE with AES) and key length (256 bits) are both considered strong and appropriate for most applications.

3. **CWE-327: Use of a Weak Cryptographic Algorithm**
   - **Vulnerable code:** `pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)));`
   - **Reason:** PBE with AES is a well-established and widely accepted encryption algorithm. It is not considered weak or outdated.
