### False Positive Misuse ###

The following are identified as false positives:

1. "Missing Encryption Algorithm": This misuse is considered a false positive because the provided code snippet shows the creation of `PBEParameterSpec`, which is a setup for encryption parameters, but does not detail the actual usage of these parameters in encryption processes. The encryption algorithm might be specified elsewhere in the code that is not visible in the snippet provided.

2. "Unused Salt Generation": This is misidentified as the salt is clearly being used in the creation of `PBEParameterSpec`. There is no evidence in the provided code snippet that the salt remains unused for encryption.

3. "Inadequate Salt Size for PBE": Using a larger salt than the typical sizes of 8 or 16 bytes is not a misuse; in fact, it is a good practice for security. Having a salt size of 32 bytes, as seen in the snippet, is therefore not a security concern and this report is a false positive.
