### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom.SecureRandom(byte[])",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom constructor is initialized with a single byte seed, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. An attacker could potentially guess the seed and predict the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which uses a more robust entropy source to generate random numbers."
