### False Positive Misuses ###
1. CWE-326: Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-326)

The misuse report flags the use of `KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")` without specifying the key size. However, in this context, the key size is explicitly set in the subsequent line `SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();`. Therefore, this misuse report is a false positive.
