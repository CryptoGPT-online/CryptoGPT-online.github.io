        "description": "The use of Blowfish algorithm is considered broken and insecure. It has been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including the Blowfish vulnerability, which allows an attacker to recover the encryption key. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, instead.",
