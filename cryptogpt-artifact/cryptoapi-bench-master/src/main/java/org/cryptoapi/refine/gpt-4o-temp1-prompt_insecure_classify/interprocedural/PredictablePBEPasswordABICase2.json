### False Positive Misuse ###

None of the misused entries seem to be false positives based on the code and misuse descriptions provided. Each misuse case accurately identifies issues in the code related to hardcoded credentials and inadequate encryption strength.

[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static String KEY = \"sagar\";",
        "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded, which could be easily discovered and used by an attacker to decrypt sensitive data.",
        "recommendation": "Store encryption keys in a secure location, such as a secure hardware module or use environment variables. Do not hardcode them in the source code."

        "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey,salt,10000,16);",
        "description": "The key length is set to 16 bits, which is inadequate for encryption and can be broken easily using modern computational resources.",
        "recommendation": "Use a key length of at least 128 bits for symmetric encryption keys to ensure adequate security."
