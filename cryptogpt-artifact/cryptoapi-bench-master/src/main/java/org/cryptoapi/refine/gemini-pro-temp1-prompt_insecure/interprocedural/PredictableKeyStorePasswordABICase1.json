    "misuse category": "Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyStore.load(InputStream, char[])",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
    "description": "The cryptographic key used to encrypt the keystore is weak, which could allow an attacker to brute-force the key and decrypt the keystore.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong encryption algorithm, such as AES-256, to encrypt the keystore."

    "vulnerable_method": "URL(String)",
    "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "description": "The code loads a keystore from a hard-coded URL, which makes it easy for attackers to tamper with the keystore or impersonate the server.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure method to obtain the keystore, such as loading it from a secure location or using a certificate authority (CA)."
