### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse related to "Inadequate Randomness" is a false positive. The `System.out.println(md.digest());` line is not related to randomness but to the improper handling of the output of a cryptographic operation. The issue is that the byte array is not being converted to a human-readable format before being printed.

2. The misuse related to "Insecure Printing of Sensitive Data" is a false positive in the context of this code snippet. While it is generally a bad practice to print sensitive data, the code provided does not indicate that the data being printed is sensitive. However, the misuse is valid in terms of the output not being human-readable.
