    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nkeyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();",
    "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes()",
    "description": "The code is using `SecureRandom.ints()` to generate the key bytes, which is not cryptographically secure. `SecureRandom.ints()` is meant for non-security-sensitive applications and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the key bytes. For Java, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which is a CSPRNG suitable for cryptographic applications."

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "byte[] keyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();",
    "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes()",
    "description": "The code is using a SecureRandom to generate a key for the AES algorithm. However, the SecureRandom is being used to generate a string of ints, which is then converted to a byte array. This is not a secure way to generate a key, as the resulting key will not be cryptographically strong.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a SecureRandom to generate a string of ints, the code should use the SecureRandom to generate a byte array directly. This will ensure that the resulting key is cryptographically strong."
