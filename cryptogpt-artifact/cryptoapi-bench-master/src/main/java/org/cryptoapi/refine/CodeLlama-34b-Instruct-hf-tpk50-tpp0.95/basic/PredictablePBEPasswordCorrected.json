 Here is the JSON response:
```json
{
    "misuses": [
        {
            "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
            "vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength)",
            "description": "The PBEKeySpec class is a broken encryption algorithm that has been shown to be insecure. It uses a salt that is only 16 bytes long, which is not enough to prevent attacks. Additionally, the iteration count is only 11010, which is also insecure. The correct iteration count should be at least 100000.",
            "recommendation": "Replace the PBEKeySpec class with a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
        }
    ]
}
