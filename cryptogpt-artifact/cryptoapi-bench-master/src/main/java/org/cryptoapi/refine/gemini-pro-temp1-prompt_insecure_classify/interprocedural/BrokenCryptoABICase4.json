[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance()",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code is using the RC2 algorithm, which is considered to be a weak and insecure algorithm. RC2 is susceptible to various attacks, including brute-force attacks, and should not be used for any cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the RC2 algorithm with a more secure alternative, such as AES or ChaCha20."
