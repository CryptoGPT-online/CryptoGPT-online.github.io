### False Positive Misuse

* CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	+ Vulnerable Code: `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");`
	+ Description: The code is using the "AES" algorithm, which is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. It is not recommended to use this algorithm as it is vulnerable to attacks such as brute force and side-channel attacks.
	+ Recommendation: Use a more secure and recommended algorithm such as AES-GCM, AES-CTR, or AES-CBC with a secure mode of operation such as CBC-CTR or GCM-SIV.
