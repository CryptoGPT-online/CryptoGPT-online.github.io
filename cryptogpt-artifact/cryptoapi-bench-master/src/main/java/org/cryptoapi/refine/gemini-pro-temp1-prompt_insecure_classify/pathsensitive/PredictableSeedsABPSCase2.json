```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The seed used to initialize the `SecureRandom` object is not sufficiently random, making it easier for an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated by the object.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method of generating the seed value, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. This method will generate a seed value that is cryptographically strong and resistant to attack."
