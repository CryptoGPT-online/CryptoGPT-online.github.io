### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Insecure Cryptographic Storage" - The code stores the cryptographic algorithm name in a static character array, which is not sensitive information. The misuse would be valid if it were storing keys or secrets, but in this case, it's just the name of the algorithm.

2. "Insecure Direct Object Reference" - The assignment `crypto = CRYPTO;` is not a direct object reference issue in the context of security because it's not exposing any sensitive data or functionality to user input or manipulation.

3. "Unnecessary complexity" - While the conversion of the algorithm name to a char array and back to a string is unnecessary from a code cleanliness perspective, it does not introduce a security risk by itself.
