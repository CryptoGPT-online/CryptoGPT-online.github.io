### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse list that was initially provided contains only empty JSON arrays, which correlates correctly with the absence of cryptographic API usage in the provided code snippet. Since the code does not perform any cryptographic operations or certificate validations, the empty arrays accurately reflect that there are no misuses to report. Subsequently, there are no false positives to address in this situation.

The empty arrays indicate that the tool or process that generated these reports did not find any misuse. Given that there are no cryptographic API calls in the given code, the empty misuse reports are consistent with the code analysis.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
Since the misuse reports were already empty and there are no cryptographic APIs used in the provided code, there is no need to optimize or alter the JSON. The misuse lists, as provided, are correct:

```json
[]
```

```json

```

```json
