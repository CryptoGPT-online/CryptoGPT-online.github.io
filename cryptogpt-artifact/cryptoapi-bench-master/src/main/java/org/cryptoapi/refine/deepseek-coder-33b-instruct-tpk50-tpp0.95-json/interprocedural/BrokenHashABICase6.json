### False Positive Misuse ###
There are some misuses that are false positives:

1. The misuse "Insecure Cryptographic Storage" is false positive as crypto variable is not storing any sensitive information and it's not being used for storing/retrieving sensitive information. The crypto variable is initialized with a static value 'MD5'.

2. The misuse "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm Use" is also false positive as the cryptographic algorithm (MD5) is not insecure per se, as long as it's used correctly (i.e., not for secure purposes). MD5 is considered to be broken and not suitable for further use, but not insecure for general purposes.

        "description": "The 'crypto' variable is an array of characters and it is not guaranteed to hold the name of any recognized cryptographic algorithm by MessageDigest.getInstance(). In the current code, it holds the characters of the string 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO', which is 'MD5'. However, if 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO' is changed to a string that does not represent a recognized cryptographic algorithm, the code will throw a NoSuchAlgorithmException at runtime.",
