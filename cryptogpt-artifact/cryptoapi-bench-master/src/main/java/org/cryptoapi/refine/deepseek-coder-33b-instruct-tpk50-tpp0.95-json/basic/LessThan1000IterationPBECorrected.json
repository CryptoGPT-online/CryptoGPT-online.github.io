False Positive Misuses:

[
  {
    "misuse category": "Weak Random Number Generation",
    "vulnerable_method": "Ld.key2(), SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); \nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); \nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a random salt which is a good practice. However, it's not mentioned in the misuse that the salt needs to be periodically reseeded.",
    "recommendation": "To avoid predictability, ensure that the SecureRandom object is reseeded periodically."
