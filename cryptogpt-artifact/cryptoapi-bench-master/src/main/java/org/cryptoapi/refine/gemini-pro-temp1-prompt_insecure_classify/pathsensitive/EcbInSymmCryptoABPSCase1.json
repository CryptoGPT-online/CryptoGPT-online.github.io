[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength. (CBC mode requires an IV.)",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "CBC mode requires an IV (Initialization Vector) to be used. Not providing an IV can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "When using CBC mode, an IV should be generated and used properly."

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode for AES, which is not a secure mode of operation and is susceptible to various attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "ECB mode is a less secure block cipher mode compared to CBC mode, as it does not provide confidentiality for adjacent blocks of data.",
    "recommendation": "Use CBC mode instead of ECB mode for block cipher operations."
