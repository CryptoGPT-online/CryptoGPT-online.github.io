### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses appear to be false positives. The identified issues are legitimate concerns in the context of modern cryptographic standards.

        "misuse": "Insecure Key Size",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final int DEFAULT_KEY_SIZE = 1024;",
        "description": "The RSA key size of 1024 bits is considered insecure as it can be broken with sufficient computational power. According to current security standards, the minimum key size for RSA should be 2048 bits.",
        "recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 2048 bits for RSA (DEFAULT_KEY_SIZE = 2048;)."

        "description": "Using a hard-coded transformation ('RSA') without specifying padding and mode makes the use of the transformation ambiguous and can result in using default insecure configurations.",
        "recommendation": "Use 'RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding' for RSA encryption, which includes appropriate padding and avoids the use of ECB mode for higher security."
