### False Positive Misuses ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - Vulnerable Code: `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES\");`
   - Explanation: This misuse report is false positive because it fails to consider the context. In this specific case, the key size is not being set explicitly. The default key size for AES is 128 bits, which is considered adequate for most applications.
