    "description": "The use of the Blowfish algorithm is considered to be insecure due to its age and known weaknesses. It is recommended to use more secure algorithms such as AES or ChaCha20.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the Blowfish algorithm with a more secure one, such as AES or ChaCha20."

    "vulnerable_code": "String cryptoAlgo = c;\nmethod1(cryptoAlgo);",
    "description": "The code takes a user-supplied string `c` which is an algorithm name, and passes it to the `method1` function without any validation. This is dangerous because an attacker could pass in an insecure or broken algorithm, leading to a compromise of the cryptographic operations performed by the code.",
    "recommendation": "The code should validate the `c` input string to ensure that it contains a cryptographically secure algorithm. Additionally, the code should use a more secure algorithm, such as AES-256 or ChaCha20, instead of Blowfish, which is considered insecure."
