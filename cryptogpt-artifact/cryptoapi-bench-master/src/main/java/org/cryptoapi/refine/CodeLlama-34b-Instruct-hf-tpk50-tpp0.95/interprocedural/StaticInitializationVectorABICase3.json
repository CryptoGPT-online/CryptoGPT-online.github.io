 ### False Positive Misuse JSON ###

The following misuses are false positives:

1. "Broken Crypto Algorithm"
	* The misuse is correct, but the recommendation is incorrect. The correct recommendation is to use a more secure cipher, such as AES/GCM/NoPadding.
2. "Weak Key Generation"
	* The misuse is correct, but the recommendation is incorrect. The correct recommendation is to use a secure random number generator to generate the key.
3. "Insecure IV Generation"
	* The misuse is correct, but the recommendation is incorrect. The correct recommendation is to use a secure random number generator to generate the IV.
