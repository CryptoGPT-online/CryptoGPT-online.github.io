False Positive Misuse:

None of the reported misuses are false positives. The iteration count is currently set to 11010, which is far lower than the recommended minimum value of 100,000. This makes the PBE algorithm run much slower, increasing the amount of time an attacker needs to brute-force the password.

[
  {
    "misuse category": "Weak Cryptographic Algorithm Configuration",
    "vulnerable_method": "P3.method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The iteration count is far too high for security purposes. This can cause the key generation process to take unreasonably long, and potentially lock up or crash the application.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a key generation iteration count within a reasonable range for your application to ensure it performs securely. Typical recommendations are around 1,000 iterations."
