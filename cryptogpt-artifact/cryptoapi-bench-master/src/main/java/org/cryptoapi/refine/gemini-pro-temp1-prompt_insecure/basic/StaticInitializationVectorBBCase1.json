  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Entropy for Random Number Generation",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\ngenerateKey()",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses `KeyGenerator.generateKey()` to generate a secret key for AES encryption without specifying a source of randomness. This can result in weak or predictable keys.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (e.g., `SecureRandom`) to generate cryptographically strong keys."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses the \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" cipher, which is a legacy algorithm that has known vulnerabilities and is no longer considered secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The AES algorithm is used without specifying the key size. By default, it uses 128-bit keys, which are considered weak and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a strong key size, such as 256 bits, when generating the AES key."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-Coded Cryptographic Key",
    "vulnerable_method": "getBytes()",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded value (\"abcde\") as the initialization vector for the cipher. This makes the cipher vulnerable to attack, as an attacker can guess the IV and decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV and use it to initialize the cipher."
