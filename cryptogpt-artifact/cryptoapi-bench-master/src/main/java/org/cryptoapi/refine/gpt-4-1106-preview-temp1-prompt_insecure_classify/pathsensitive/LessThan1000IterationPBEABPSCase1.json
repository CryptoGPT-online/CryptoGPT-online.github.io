### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse related to CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values can be considered a false positive. The code is using `SecureRandom` which is a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG). The salt is being generated by calling `random.nextBytes(salt);` which properly populates the salt with random values. As long as `SecureRandom` is not improperly seeded (and there's no indication in the code that it is), it should use the platform's default (and presumably strong) source of entropy. Therefore, the concerns raised in the misuse description do not apply.
