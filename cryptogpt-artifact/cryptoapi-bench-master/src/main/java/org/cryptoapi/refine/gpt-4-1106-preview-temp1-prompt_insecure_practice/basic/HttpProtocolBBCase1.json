### False Positive Misuse ###
The provided code snippet does not involve any cryptographic API directly. It simply creates a new URL object with an "http" scheme. While it is true that using "http" instead of "https" can lead to the cleartext transmission of sensitive information, this is not a misuse of a cryptographic API per se. It is more of a general security concern related to the choice of protocol for data transmission.
