### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials (in all reports)
   - The `defaultKey` is derived from a call to `SecureRandom`'s `ints()` function and not hardcoded. Every execution will generate a different key, therefore, it is incorrect to characterize this as hardcoded credentials. The misuse related to this should be removed.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength (in all reports)
   - The report comments on the use of AES with a 128-bit key as potentially inadequate. However, AES-128 is widely considered secure and appropriate for most practical applications. As the report does not provide context suggesting that AES-256 is required, this is likely a false positive unless specific high-security requirements demand larger key sizes. For the general case, AES-128 is considered sufficiently secure.

3. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (for the conversion to a String)
   - Although converting a random integer stream to a string is unusual and may have implementation-specific issues, as long as the resulting string is converted back to a suitably sized byte[] and used to initialize a `SecretKeySpec`, the entropy should not be reduced due to the string conversion itself. The SecureRandom usage is correctly producing random integers, so the misuse identified in this case is only considered a false positive if the random values are correctly sized and used for key material. However, caution is advised, and the recommendation to use `random.generateSeed(int numBytes)` to generate a random seed of a specific length would be the better practice.
