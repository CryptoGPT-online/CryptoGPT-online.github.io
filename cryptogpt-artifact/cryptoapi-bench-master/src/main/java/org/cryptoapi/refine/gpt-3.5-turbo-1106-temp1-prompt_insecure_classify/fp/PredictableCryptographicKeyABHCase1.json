```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
        "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random values for cryptographic operations. In this code snippet, the SecureRandom instance is created without specifying a specific algorithm or seed. This means that the default algorithm and seed will be used, which may not provide sufficient random values for cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to specify a specific algorithm and seed when creating a SecureRandom instance. For example, SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() should be used to create a SecureRandom instance with a strong algorithm and seed."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
        "description": "The code uses a key length of 16 bytes, which is insecure. AES keys should be at least 128 bits (16 bytes) in length.",
        "recommendation": "Use a longer key length, such as 128 bits (16 bytes) or higher, for AES encryption."
