    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",

    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is no longer considered secure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that two different inputs can produce the same hash output. This can be exploited to create fraudulent messages or digital signatures that appear to be authentic.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD5."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Key-Generation Algorithm with Fewer Bits than the Encryption Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
    "description": "Using SHA-256 algorithm for message digesting but the underlying block cipher is unknown and could be using a key size of less than 256 bits, which can result in a collision attack.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the key generation algorithm and block cipher key size are cryptographically secure and appropriate for the application's security requirements."
