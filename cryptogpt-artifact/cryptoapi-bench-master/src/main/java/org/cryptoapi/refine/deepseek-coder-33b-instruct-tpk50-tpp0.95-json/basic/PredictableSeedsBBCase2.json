False Positives:
1. "Weak Seed" Misuse:
This might be a false positive due to the fact that although the seed is just a single byte, it could theoretically be as random as needed, depending on the usage context. 

2. "Insufficient Entropy for SecureRandom" Misuse:
This is indeed a misuse. However, it's context-dependent. In this particular case, the use of a single byte as seed is insecure because it provides only 256 possible seeds. It's always good to choose a sufficiently large, random seed for the secure random number generation.

    "description": "The SecureRandom class relies on a cryptographically strong algorithm to generate random numbers. If this algorithm is not cryptographically strong, it can be subject to exploitation. The use of a single byte as seed can also be insecure.",
    "recommendation": "It's recommended to use a secure seed for the SecureRandom class. For example, you could use a value that is generated by a cryptographic algorithm."
