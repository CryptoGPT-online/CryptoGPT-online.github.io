        "misuse": "Hardcoded Cryptographic Key",
        "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
        "description": "The cryptographic key is hardcoded in the source code, which is insecure as it can easily be extracted by attackers.",

        "description": "The key is derived simply by copying it into a 16-byte array without a proper key derivation function, leading to potential weak keys.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt to derive the key."
