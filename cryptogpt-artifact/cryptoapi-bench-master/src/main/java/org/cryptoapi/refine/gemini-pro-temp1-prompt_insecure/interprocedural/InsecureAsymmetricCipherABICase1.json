### False Positive Misuse ###
1). **"Weak Key Generation Algorithm"**: This misuse is a false positive because the code is using the RSA algorithm, which is considered a strong cryptographic algorithm, even with a 1024-bit key size. However, it is recommended to use a key size of at least 2048 bits for enhanced security.

2). **"Insecure SealedObject Usage"**: This misuse is also a false positive because the `SealedObject` class is not used to encrypt or decrypt any data in the provided code snippet. The `SealedObject` class is primarily used for object serialization and deserialization, not for encryption or decryption.
