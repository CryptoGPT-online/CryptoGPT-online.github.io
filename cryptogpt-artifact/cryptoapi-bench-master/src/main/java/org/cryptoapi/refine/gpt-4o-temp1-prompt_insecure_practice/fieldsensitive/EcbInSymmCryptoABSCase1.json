### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Insecure Encryption Algorithm - Static Key Size**:  
   - **Reason**: The use of `KeyGenerator` for AES without specifying a key size typically defaults to a secure size (128 bits or higher) depending on the security provider's default settings. While explicitly setting the key size (e.g., `keyGen.init(256);`) ensures desired security levels, the absence of a specified key size is not inherently insecure or a misuse if the default is adequate for the application.

2. **Default Initialization Vector (IV)**:  
   - **Reason**: The use of ECB mode in the example code does not use an IV, as ECB does not require one. Therefore, any mention of default or predictable IVs is not applicable to the ECB mode specifically.
