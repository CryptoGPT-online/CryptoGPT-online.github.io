### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Hardcoded Salt" is a false positive. The code generates a new random salt for each execution, which is the correct approach. The salt is not hardcoded.

2. The misuse "Insecure Randomness" is a false positive. The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate the salt, which is a secure choice for cryptographic operations.

3. The misuse "Missing Secure Random Number Generation" is a false positive. The code properly uses `SecureRandom` to generate the salt.

4. The misuse "Use of Key for Multiple Purposes" is a false positive. There is no evidence in the provided code that the key is being used for multiple purposes.
