### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Insecure Default Charset Usage:
   - The code proceeds correctly with UTF-8 encoding, which is a recommended and secure standard for encoding text to byte representation. The reported concern about unpredictable results due to charset conversion is not a valid threat in this context, as encoding is explicitly specified.
  
2. Possible Variability in Key Derivation:
   - The "Weak PBE KeySpec Configuration" argument criticizes the use of 128-bit keys, considering them insufficient when currently, 128-bit keys still offer substantial cryptographic security. While 256 bits every time is preferable when resources permit, using 128 bits is not inherently insecure for all purposes and does not warrant a strong claim of misuse by itself.

3. "Use of Password-Based Encryption (PBE) with Default Salt and Iteration":
   - Examining the logic, the secure random salt is freshly generated for each session, mitigating concerns about uniqueness across instances. As the salt generation's uniqueness has been addressed in the provided code, this report seems unwarranted.
