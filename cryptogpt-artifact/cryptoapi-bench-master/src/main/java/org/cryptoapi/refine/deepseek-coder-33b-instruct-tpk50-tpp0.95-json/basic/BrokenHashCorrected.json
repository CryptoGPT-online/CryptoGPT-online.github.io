The provided code does not contain any cryptographic API misuses. It correctly obtains a SHA-256 MessageDigest instance, which is a secure and widely used cryptographic hash function. Therefore, the misuses list contains a false positive and does not provide any useful information.

---False Positive Misuse---

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "None",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
        "description": "The provided code gets an instance of the SHA-256 message digest, which is a secure and widely used cryptographic hash function.",
        "recommendation": "No action is needed for this piece of code."
    }
]
```

---Optimized Misuse JSON---

```json
[]
```

The optimized misuse list is empty because the provided code does not contain any cryptographic API misuses.
