### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The "Static Key Specification" misuse is a false positive. The code does not use a static string as the encryption key. Instead, it uses the `KeyGenerator` to generate a secret key dynamically.

2. The "Lack of Key Size Specification" misuse is a false positive. While it is true that specifying the key size is a good practice, the `KeyGenerator` for DES defaults to generating a key of the maximum size for DES (56 bits), which is the standard. However, DES itself is considered insecure, so the recommendation should be to use a more secure algorithm rather than specifying a key size for DES.

3. The "Missing Cryptographic Algorithm Parameter Checks" misuse is a false positive. The code does not show any external input being used to select the cryptographic algorithm. The parameters are hardcoded in the `main` method and passed through the methods. However, the code could be improved by adding checks or using secure defaults to prevent misuse if the methods are later modified to accept external input.
