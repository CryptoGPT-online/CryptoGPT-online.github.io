 ### False Positive Misuses

1. The misuse report for CWE-757, "Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation," is a false positive. The code does not perform any negotiation or selection of algorithms during runtime, so this misuse is not applicable.
2. The misuse report for CWE-327, "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm," in the line `String crypto = "MD4";` is a false positive. The variable `crypto` is never used as a cryptographic algorithm in the code, so this misuse is not applicable.

    "vulnerable_method": "B1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
    "description": "MD4 is a broken cryptographic hash function and should not be used for any security-related purposes. It is not collision resistant and can be easily attacked using brute force attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the use of MD4 with a more secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. For example, replace `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")` with `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")`."
