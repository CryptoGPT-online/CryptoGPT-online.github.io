### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C1(20);",
        "description": "The code initializes C1 with a hardcoded iteration count of 20. The iteration count in cryptographic operations such as password-based encryption (PBE) should be large enough to delay brute-force attacks. A count of 20 is insufficient for this purpose.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value that is considered secure according to current cryptographic standards, typically in the range of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands."
