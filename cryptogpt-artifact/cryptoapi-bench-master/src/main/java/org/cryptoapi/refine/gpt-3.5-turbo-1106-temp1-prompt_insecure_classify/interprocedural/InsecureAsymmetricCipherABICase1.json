    "description": "The code is using the RSA algorithm for key pair generation, which is considered secure. However, the key size of 1024 bits is considered weak and can be easily cracked. It is recommended to use a larger key size (e.g., 2048 bits or more) for better security.",

    "description": "The code is using RSA algorithm for encryption, which has encryption strength issues. RSA should only be used for key exchange and not for encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES for encrypting the data."
