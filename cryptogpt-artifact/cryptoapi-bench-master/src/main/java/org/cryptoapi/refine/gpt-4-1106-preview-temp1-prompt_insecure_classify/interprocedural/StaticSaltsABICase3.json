### False Positive Misuse ###
It can be considered a false positive to flag the hardcoded salt as "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" because the purpose of the salt in cryptographic operations is not to serve as a secret in the same sense as a password or cryptographic key, but rather to ensure the uniqueness of the output. While it is a best practice to use a randomly generated salt, it is not inherently a misuse of hardcoded credentials unless the salt is also expected to remain secret.
