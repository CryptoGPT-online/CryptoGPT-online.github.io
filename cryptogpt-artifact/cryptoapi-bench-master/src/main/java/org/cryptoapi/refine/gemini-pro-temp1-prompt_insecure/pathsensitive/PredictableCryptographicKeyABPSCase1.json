[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed 16-byte key for AES encryption, which is considered insecure. AES keys should be at least 256 bits (32 bytes) for adequate security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure key length, such as 256 bits (32 bytes), for the SecretKeySpec."
