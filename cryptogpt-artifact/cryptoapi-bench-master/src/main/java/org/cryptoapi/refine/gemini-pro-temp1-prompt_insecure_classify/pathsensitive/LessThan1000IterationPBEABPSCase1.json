### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom::nextBytes",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is used without a seed, which may result in predictable random values. This can weaken the security of the encryption algorithm and make it easier for an attacker to break the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator, such as SecureRandom with a seed, to generate the salt and other random values."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "PBEParameterSpec::<init>",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec is being used with a low iteration count (`count`) of 1050, which may not be sufficient to protect against brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 100,000 or more, to make the encryption more resistant to brute-force attacks."
