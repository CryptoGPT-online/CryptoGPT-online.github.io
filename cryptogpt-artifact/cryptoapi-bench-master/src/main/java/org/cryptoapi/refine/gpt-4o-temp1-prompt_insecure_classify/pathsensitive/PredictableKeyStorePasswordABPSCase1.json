### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.**
   - The misuse report suggests that using a hardcoded password "changeit" poses a security risk. However, the code demonstrates that the password is only used initially as a placeholder and is soon replaced by a password generated using `SecureRandom` when `choice > 1`. Since the code defaults to using `SecureRandom` for passwords, the hardcoded password is not actually applied for potentially sensitive operations.
