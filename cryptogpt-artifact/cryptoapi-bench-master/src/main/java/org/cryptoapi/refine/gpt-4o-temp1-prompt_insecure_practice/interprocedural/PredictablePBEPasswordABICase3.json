### False Positive Misuse ###

- **Inappropriate Key Length for PBE**: The key length is specified as 16, but it references the number of bytes, not bits. In Java, the `PBEKeySpec` constructor's length parameter is intended to specify the key size in bits, and the typical usage for strong encryption would indeed be either 128 bits or an equivalent length. The description suggesting 16 bits may imply misunderstanding since the realistic mistake is using 16 bytes interpreted as bits (128 bits). Here, it does convey an error, but the confusion is in understanding bytes vs. bits:

  ```json
  {
      "misuse": "Inappropriate Key Length for PBE",
      "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
      "description": "A key length of 16 bits is considered weak for cryptographic purposes and may not provide sufficient security.",
      "recommendation": "Use a stronger key length, for example, 128 bits or higher, to ensure a sufficient level of security."
  }
  ```

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Hardcoded Password",
        "vulnerable_code": "String password = \"sagar\";",
        "description": "Hardcoding passwords in the source code can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access if they obtain the source code or through other means.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding, retrieve the password from a secure source at runtime, for example, from environment variables or secure input mechanisms."
    }
]
