 ### False Positive Misuses ###

* Misuse Category: "Insufficient Entropy"
* Vulnerable Method: "main()"
* Vulnerable Code: "DEFAULT_SEED = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};"
* Description: "The DEFAULT_SEED variable is set to a static value, which can lead to a lack of entropy in the random number generation. This can make it easier for attackers to predict the random numbers and gain unauthorized access to the system."
* Recommendation: "Replace the DEFAULT_SEED variable with a random or unpredictable value, such as a generated UUID or a secure random number."

"description": "The SecureRandom class in Java is designed to be used as a source of randomness for cryptographic purposes. However, in this code, the generated random value is not being used correctly, as it is being used to initialize a variable that is not being properly randomized. This can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure source of randomness, such as /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems, to initialize the variable securely. Alternatively, use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) like the SHA-1 PRNG algorithm."
