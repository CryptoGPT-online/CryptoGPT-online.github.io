### False Positive Misuse ###
There are no false positives in the provided misuse reports. The code does utilize AES with ECB mode, which is generally considered a risky cryptographic practice. Although the `go` method includes a conditional switch to CBC mode based on the `choice` parameter, there is a valid case where ECB mode could be employed, thus each reported misuse is justified.

        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "The use of ECB mode in AES encryption is insecure because it does not provide serious message confidentiality, meaning that the same plaintext block will always result in the same ciphertext block. This can lead to patterns being discernible in the ciphertext.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC (with a random IV for each encryption) or GCM which provides both confidentiality and integrity."
