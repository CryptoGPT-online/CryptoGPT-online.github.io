### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Insufficient Key Size**

   Explanation: The given key size in the code is 128 bits, which is a valid key length for AES encryption. The potential concern is that `Arrays.copyOf` could be attempting to adjust an insufficiently long key. However, since AES supports 128 bits and the code correctly adjusts to this length, the issue is more about the quality of randomness and key generation method, not strictly a key size violation. The recommended approach is to focus on randomness and proper secure generation, not the size alone.
