### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Misuse: **SHA1PRNG SecureRandom Initialization**
   - Reason: The provided code initializes a `SecureRandom` instance without specifying the algorithm. This does not necessarily imply the use of SHA1PRNG. The actual algorithm used depends on the JVM's default and its security configuration. Without explicit context (e.g., a specified instance or deprecated methods), claiming this as a misuse is a false assumption based solely on the code itself.
