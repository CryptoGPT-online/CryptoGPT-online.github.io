### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Insufficient Salt Size" reported in the first list is a false positive. The code correctly initializes a salt with 32 bytes, which is 256 bits, exceeding the recommended minimum of 64 bits.

2. The misuse "Inadequate Salt Size" in the last list is also a false positive. As mentioned above, the salt size of 32 bytes is more than adequate.

3. The misuse "Hardcoded Sensitive Values" in the second list is a false positive. The values stored in the map are not sensitive values like encryption keys but rather configuration parameters.

4. The misuse "Use of Deprecated API" in the second list is not a security issue but rather a code quality issue. It does not represent a cryptographic API misuse.

5. The misuse "Unencrypted Key Storage" in the fourth list is a false positive. The map does not store encryption keys but configuration parameters.

6. The misuse "PBEParameterSpec without a Secure Algorithm" in the fourth list is a false positive. The code does not show the use of PBEParameterSpec with an algorithm, so it cannot be determined if an insecure algorithm is used.
