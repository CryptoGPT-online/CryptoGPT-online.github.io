### False Positive Misuse ###

- CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials:
  - The reported misuse for the iteration count being hardcoded to 20 is a false positive. While it is generally not recommended to hardcode sensitive values, the iteration count in this case is used as a parameter to the PBEParameterSpec class, which is used to configure a Password-Based Encryption (PBE) algorithm. The iteration count specifies the number of times the encryption algorithm should be applied, and it is not considered a sensitive value. Therefore, this misuse can be considered a false positive.
