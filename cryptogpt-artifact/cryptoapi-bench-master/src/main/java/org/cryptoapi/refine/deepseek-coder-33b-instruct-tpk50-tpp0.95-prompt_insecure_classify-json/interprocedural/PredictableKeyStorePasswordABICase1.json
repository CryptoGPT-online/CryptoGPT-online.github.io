        "description": "The use of hard-coded password in the source code can lead to a serious security vulnerability. A password should never be hard-coded in the source code, and it should be stored securely, such as in a configuration file or environment variable.",

        "description": "The Java KeyStore is using the less secure algorithm type JKS which is a proprietary format.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm like PKCS12 which supports password-based encryption and provides better security."

        "description": "This code loads a KeyStore from a URL. While JKS is a valid keystore type, it's usually used with the default keystore type that's provided by the Java platform and which is usually a file. This might not be secure in production environments. Anyone who has access to the URL could download and load an arbitrary keystore.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure, trusted method to distribute the keystore. Consider using a file-based keystore if you need to keep it secret."
