```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String)",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses SHA-1, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for secure applications. SHA-1 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that different inputs can produce the same hash value, leading to a security compromise.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
