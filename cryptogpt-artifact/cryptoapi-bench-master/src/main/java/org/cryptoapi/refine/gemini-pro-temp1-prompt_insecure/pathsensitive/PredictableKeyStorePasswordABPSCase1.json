    "vulnerable_code": "`SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();`",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` without providing a cryptographically secure seed, which can lead to weak key generation and potential compromise of the application.",

    "description": "The code generates a key using `String.valueOf(random.ints())`, which is not a cryptographically secure way to generate a key.",
