### False Positive Misuse ###

        "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_method": "go3() in class P3",
        "vulnerable_code": "seed = SEED;",
        "description": "The misuse is a false positive because SEED is a static final array, which can't be manipulated by other code. It isn't changed to a different array or value by any method, so it remains the same.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to keep using a truly random seed for the SecureRandom object."

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed)",
        "description": "The use of SecureRandom with a weak or easily guessable seed weakens the encryption strength. In the given code, the seed is a static byte array with values [100, 200], which is not random and thus is easily guessable. This would make the generated random numbers less secure and less random.",
        "recommendation": "Use a much larger, truly random seed for SecureRandom. You could generate this seed by using SecureRandom itself. However, be aware that using a truly random seed for a security purpose could be expensive in terms of performance."
