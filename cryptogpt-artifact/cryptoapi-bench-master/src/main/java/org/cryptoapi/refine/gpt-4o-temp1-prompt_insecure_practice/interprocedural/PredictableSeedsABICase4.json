### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Hardcoded Cryptographic Seed**: 
   - Justification: While the `DEFAULT_SEED` does use a hardcoded value `"100"`, in the context of this application, this misuse is already implicitly addressed within the documented misuse of using SecureRandom with a predictable seed. The analysis of `DEFAULT_SEED` as an independent misuse is redundant because it doesn't, on its own, directly execute or control the randomness mechanism without its association in code.
