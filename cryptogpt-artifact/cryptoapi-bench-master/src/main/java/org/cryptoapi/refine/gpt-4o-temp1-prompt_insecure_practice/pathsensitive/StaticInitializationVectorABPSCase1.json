### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Insecure IV Length**: Although the misuse report suggests an issue with conditional IV generation, the code does generate a 16-byte secure random IV when `choice > 1`. The problem is with the hardcoded IV when `choice` is not greater than 1, which is captured by other similar misuse reports.

2. **Insecure IV with CBC Mode**: This report addresses the conditional logic for IV generation. However, the misuse successfully handled is already captured in the reports about the hardcoded IVs.

3. **Hardcoded Cryptographic Key**: The description confuses an IV for a key, which is inaccurate since the misuse involves an IV, not the cryptographic key itself.
