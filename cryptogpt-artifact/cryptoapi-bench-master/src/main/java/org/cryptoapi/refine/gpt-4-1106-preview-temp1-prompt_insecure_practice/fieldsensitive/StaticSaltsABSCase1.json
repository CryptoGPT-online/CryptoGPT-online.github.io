### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Default Initialization Vector (IV)" - This is a false positive because the `PBEParameterSpec` class does not use an IV in the traditional sense. The salt parameter in `PBEParameterSpec` serves a similar purpose to an IV, but it is not an IV in the context of block cipher modes of operation. Therefore, the misuse related to the IV is not applicable.

2. "Static Salts are Insecure" - This is partially a false positive. While it is true that static salts are insecure, the code does not show that `defSalt` is static in the sense that it is the same across different instances of `C1`. It is initialized in the constructor, which could potentially be with different values for different instances. However, the misuse related to overwriting the passed salt with `defSalt` is valid.

3. "Unused Parameter" - This is a false positive because the parameter `passedSalt` is indeed used, although it is immediately overwritten with `defSalt`. The misuse is more about parameter reassignment rather than the parameter being unused.
