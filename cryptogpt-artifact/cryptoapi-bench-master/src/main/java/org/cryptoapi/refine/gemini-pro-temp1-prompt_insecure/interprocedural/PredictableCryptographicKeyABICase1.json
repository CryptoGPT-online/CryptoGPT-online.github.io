[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
    "description": "The cryptographic key is hard-coded in the source code, which makes it easily accessible to potential attackers.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the cryptographic key dynamically or securely store it in a protected location."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Key-Derivation Function without Salt",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The key derivation function (KDF) is used without a salt, which makes it vulnerable to dictionary attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF with a random salt to generate the cryptographic key."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Weak Key Generation",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();",
    "description": "The key is generated using a simple conversion of a string to bytes, which is not secure and can be easily guessed or brute-forced.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a cryptographically strong key. For example, use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Also, consider using a key derivation function (KDF) to strengthen the key."
