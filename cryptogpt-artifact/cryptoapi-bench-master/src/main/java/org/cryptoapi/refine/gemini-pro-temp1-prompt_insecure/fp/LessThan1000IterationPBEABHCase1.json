### False Positive Misuse ###

**CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**
- vulnerable_code: PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;
  int iteration = hm.get("bbb");
- description: The code uses a variable iteration as the iteration count for the PBES2 algorithm, which is retrieved from a HashMap. Using a user-controlled value as the iteration count can lead to a denial-of-service attack, as an attacker could provide a very large value to exhaust system resources.
- recommendation: Use a fixed, secure value for the iteration count, or perform input validation to ensure that the iteration count is within a safe range.

Justification: This misuse is a false positive because the iteration count is not being used in a context where it could lead to a denial-of-service attack. The iteration count is being used to generate a key for a PBE algorithm, which is a secure algorithm that is not susceptible to denial-of-service attacks.
