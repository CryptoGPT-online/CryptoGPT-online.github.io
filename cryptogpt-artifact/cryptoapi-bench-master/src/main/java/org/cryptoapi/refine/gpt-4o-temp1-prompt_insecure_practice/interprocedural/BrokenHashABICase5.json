### False Positive Misuse ###

All the reported misuses are valid. SHA-1 is indeed a cryptographically broken algorithm due to collision vulnerabilities, and each misuse identified relates to this issue. They all provide consistent recommendations to use a more secure alternative like SHA-256 or SHA-3, which is accurate. No false positives were identified in the reports.
