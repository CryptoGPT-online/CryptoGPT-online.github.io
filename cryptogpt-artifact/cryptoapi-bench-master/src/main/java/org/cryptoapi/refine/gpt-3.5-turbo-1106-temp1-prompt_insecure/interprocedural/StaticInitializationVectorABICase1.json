        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is derived from the input bytes without proper validation or generation using a secure random number generator. The KeyGenerator does not specify a key size which could lead to weaker keys. The generated key is not securely stored or managed.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the IV (e.g., SecureRandom); specify a secure random number generator algorithm explicitly. Specify the key size explicitly for KeyGenerator (e.g., 128, 192, or 256) and use a secure method to store and manage generated keys, such as KeyStore."
