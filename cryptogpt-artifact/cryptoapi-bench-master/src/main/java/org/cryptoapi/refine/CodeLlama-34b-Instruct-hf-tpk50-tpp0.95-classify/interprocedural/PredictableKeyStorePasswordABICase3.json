{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "P3.method2(String key) -> ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
"description": "The code loads a key store from a URL, which can potentially be a less secure algorithm, as it is not guaranteed to be a secure connection.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure connection, such as HTTPS, to download the key store to ensure a secure negotiation of the algorithm."

}
```
Here is the list of false positive misuses that can be removed from the misuses list:

* CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation

Here is the list of misuses that should be added to the misuses list:

* CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
* CWE-799: Use of an Uninitialized Password
* CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
* CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
* CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

Here is the optimized misuses list in JSON format:
