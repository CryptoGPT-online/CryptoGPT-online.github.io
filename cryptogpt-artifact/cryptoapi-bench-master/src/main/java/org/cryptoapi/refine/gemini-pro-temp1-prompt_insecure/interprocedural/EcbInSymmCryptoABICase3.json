    "misuse category": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-Coded Cryptographic Key",
    "vulnerable_method": "E3.method1()",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded key for encryption. This makes the key susceptible to discovery by attackers, potentially compromising the security of the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a hard-coded key, the code should generate a random key each time it needs to encrypt data. This can be done using the `SecureRandom` class."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "E3.method1()",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the `crypto` variable to specify the cryptographic algorithm to use. However, the `crypto` variable is user-controlled and can be set to any value, including insecure or broken algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "The code should only allow a fixed set of secure cryptographic algorithms to be used. This can be done by using a whitelist or by checking the algorithm name against a list of known-good algorithms."

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "E3.method1()",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses the default key size for AES, which is 128 bits. This is considered inadequate for modern cryptographic applications. An attacker could potentially brute-force a 128-bit key in a reasonable amount of time.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size for AES, such as 256 bits."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "E3.method1()",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\" cipher, which is known to be vulnerable to certain attacks. ECB mode does not provide confidentiality, and PKCS5Padding is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher, such as \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\"."

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "E3.method2()",
    "vulnerable_code": "String cryptoAlgo = c;\nmethod1(cryptoAlgo);",
    "description": "The encryption algorithm and key size are not specified in the code, and are passed as user input. This could allow an attacker to specify a weak encryption algorithm or key size, which could make it easier to decrypt the data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong encryption algorithm and key size, and avoid passing these values as user input."

  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-256: Plaintext Modification (Injection)",
    "vulnerable_method": "E3.method2()",
    "vulnerable_code": "String cryptoAlgo = c;\nmethod1(cryptoAlgo);",
    "description": "The encryption algorithm is passed as user input, which could allow an attacker to specify a malicious algorithm that could modify or inject data into the plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Validate the user input to ensure that it is a valid encryption algorithm before using it."

    "vulnerable_code": "`cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);`",
    "description": "`AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding` is an insecure algorithm for encryption. ECB mode is known to be insecure and should be avoided.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as `AES/GCM/NoPadding`."

    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)",
    "vulnerable_method": "E3.method1()",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "Using ECB (Electronic Codebook) block cipher mode without proper countermeasures (e.g., authenticated encryption) can lead to predictable plaintext patterns and thus information leakage.",
    "recommendation": "Replace ECB with a more secure block cipher mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with appropriate padding."
