    "description": "The cryptographic key is hardcoded in the code which is a major security weakness. If an attacker were to get access to the code or the binary, they would have the key and they could decrypt the data encrypted with the key.",
    "recommendation": "Do not hardcode cryptographic keys in the code. Store them in secure storage and access them at runtime. It is also recommended to use secure methods of accessing such keys to avoid hardcoding them."

    "description": "Using a hard-coded URL in your application can be a serious security risk. In this specific case, the URL 'https://www.google.com' is used as a cacerts URL. If the URL is not properly secured, it may be prone to attacks. Furthermore, 'www.google.com' is not a valid URL for a KeyStore.",
    "recommendation": "Do not hard-code URLs in your application. Use environment variables or configuration files to store URLs. Always ensure that the URL is secure and cannot be guessed or brute-forced."

    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded cryptographic key. It is a bad practice and can lead to the key being easily found in the code. Also, using a default or common key makes the system less secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a unique, random key for each environment. It is also recommended to store sensitive data such as cryptographic keys in a secure vault or secure configuration management system."
