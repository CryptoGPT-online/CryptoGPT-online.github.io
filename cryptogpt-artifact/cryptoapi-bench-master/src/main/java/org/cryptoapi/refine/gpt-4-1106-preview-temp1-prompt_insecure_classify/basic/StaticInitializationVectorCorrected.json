### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse related to not specifying the key size when generating the AES key has been identified as a false positive.

The default key size for AES in most Java implementations is 128 bits, which is an acceptable key size for many applications. While 256 bits is considered more secure, using the default size of 128 bits is not a misuse in situations where it provides adequate security. By assuming the default key size is a weakness without any context of the security requirements, this misuse report may be misleading.
