### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: "Cipher Initialized with Incorrect Key" / "Improper Key Use"**
   - **Reason**: The logic in the code indeed uses the cipher `DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding` only when `choice` is less than or equal to 1, which is not applicable in the given `main` method because `choice` is initialized with 2. Therefore, this code execution path does not occur in the actual flow.
