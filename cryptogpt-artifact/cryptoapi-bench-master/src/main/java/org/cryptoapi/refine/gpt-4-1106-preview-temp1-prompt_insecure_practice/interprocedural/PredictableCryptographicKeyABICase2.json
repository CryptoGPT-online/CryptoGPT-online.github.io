### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "String to char[] conversion" is a false positive because the conversion from String to char array is not inherently insecure. The concern is about the immutability of Strings in Java and their persistence in memory, which is not directly related to the conversion process itself.

2. The misuse "Array.copyOf" is a false positive in the context of key size. The `Arrays.copyOf` method is used to ensure the key is of a specific size, which is a common practice when dealing with keys that must fit a certain length. The misuse would be valid if the original key material was too short, but the misuse description focuses on the `Arrays.copyOf` method itself rather than the key material's length.

3. The misuse "Incorrect Key Conversion" is a false positive because it is based on a misunderstanding of how the `toString()` method works on a char array. The misuse correctly identifies that calling `toString()` on a char array returns the object's hashcode representation, not the content. However, the misuse is reported as if the code is attempting to convert the key correctly, which is not the case. The code is indeed incorrect, but for a different reasonâ€”it does not convert the char array to a string containing the key.
