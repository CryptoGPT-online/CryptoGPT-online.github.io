### False Positive Misuse
{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey,salt,iterationCount,keyLength)",
  "description": "The code is using an insecure encryption algorithm (PBEWithMD5AndDES) and statically set parameters (iteration count and key length).",
  "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm and set iteration count and key length dynamically. The key should also not be statically set and should be complex enough to ensure its strength."
},
{
  "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
  "vulnerable_code": "new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey,salt,iterationCount,keyLength)",
  "description": "The algorithm used (PBEWithMD5AndDES) should not be used unless it is the only option. This algorithm is weak and should be avoided.",
  "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm that is still considered secure for your use case. Also, the algorithm should not be negotiated or user-selectable."
