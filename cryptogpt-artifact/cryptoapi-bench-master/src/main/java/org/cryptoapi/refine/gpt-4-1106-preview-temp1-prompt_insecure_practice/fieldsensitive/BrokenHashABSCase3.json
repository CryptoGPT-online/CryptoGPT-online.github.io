### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Insufficient Key Size" and "Incomplete Encryption" are false positives because the code is using a hashing algorithm (MessageDigest) and not performing encryption. There is no concept of key size in hashing as there is no key involved.

2. "No Algorithm Specified for MessageDigest" is a false positive because the algorithm is specified through the `crypto` variable, which is set to "MD4" in the constructor of `C3`.

3. "Use of a Non-Standard Algorithm" is partially a false positive. While MD4 is indeed non-standard and insecure, the misuse is already captured by the "Broken Crypto Algorithm" misuse.

4. "Improper Error Handling" is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse. While it is a good practice to handle errors properly, it is not directly related to the misuse of cryptographic APIs.

5. "No error handling in encryption method" is a false positive for the same reason as above.

6. "Lack of Output Encoding" is a false positive because the misuse is about the presentation of the hash output, not the security of the cryptographic operation itself.
