    "vulnerable_code": "CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();",
    "description": "The code stores the default crypto algorithm, DEFAULT_CRYPTO, as a char array in the static variable CRYPTO. This exposes the plaintext algorithm in memory, which could be accessed by an attacker if they gain access to the running program.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid storing sensitive information, such as encryption keys or algorithms, in plaintext. Consider using a secure storage mechanism, such as the Java KeyStore, to store cryptographic keys."

    "misuse category": "CWE-256: Plaintext Exposure",
    "vulnerable_method": "toCharArray()",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = CRYPTO;",
    "description": "The code assigns the value of the static variable CRYPTO to the instance variable crypto. This means that the plaintext algorithm is now stored in an instance variable, which is accessible to other instances of the B6 class.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid storing sensitive information, such as encryption keys or algorithms, in plaintext. Consider using a secure storage mechanism, such as the Java KeyStore, to store cryptographic keys."
