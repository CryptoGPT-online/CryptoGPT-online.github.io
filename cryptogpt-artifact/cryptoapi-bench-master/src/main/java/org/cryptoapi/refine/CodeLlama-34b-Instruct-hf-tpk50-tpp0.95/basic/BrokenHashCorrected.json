 Here is the optimized misuse JSON with the false positives removed:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\")",
        "description": "The code uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm, which is vulnerable to collisions. It is recommended to use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-512.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the SHA-256 hash algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-512, in the MessageDigest.getInstance() method."
    }
]
```
The false positive misuses were:

* The first JSON object, which reported a misuse of the `MessageDigest` class, but the code does not use the `MessageDigest` class.
* The second JSON object, which reported a misuse of the SHA-256 hash algorithm, but the code does not use the SHA-256 hash algorithm.
* The third JSON object, which reported a misuse of the SHA-256 hash algorithm as a Message Digest algorithm, but the code does not use SHA-256 as a Message Digest algorithm.
* The fourth JSON object, which reported a misuse of the SHA-256 hash algorithm, but the code does not use SHA-256 as a Message Digest algorithm.
