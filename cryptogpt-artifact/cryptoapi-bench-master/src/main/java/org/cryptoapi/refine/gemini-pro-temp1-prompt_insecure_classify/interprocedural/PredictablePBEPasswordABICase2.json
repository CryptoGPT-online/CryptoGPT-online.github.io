### False Positive Misuse ###

- **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**: The misuse report for `pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey, salt, 10000, 16);` is a false positive. The iteration count of 10000 is generally considered sufficient for most applications, and increasing it further may not significantly improve security while incurring a performance penalty.
