### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Use of Hardcoded Cryptographic Key" - This is a false positive because `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` is not a cryptographic key but rather a string representing the name of the hashing algorithm. It is not used for encryption or decryption but for selecting an algorithm.

2. "Insecure Hash Without a Salt" - While it is true that using a hash function without a salt is not recommended for password storage, the provided code does not indicate that the hash is being used for password storage or any other security-sensitive context. Therefore, this might be a false positive depending on the actual use case of the `go` method.

3. "Unsecured Randomness" - This misuse is incorrectly labeled. The issue here is not about randomness but about the potential for different character encodings on different platforms when calling `str.getBytes()` without specifying a charset.
