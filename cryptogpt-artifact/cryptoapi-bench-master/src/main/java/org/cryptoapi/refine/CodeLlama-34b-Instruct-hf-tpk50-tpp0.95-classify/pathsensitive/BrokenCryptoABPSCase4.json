 The code you provided contains several lists of potential cryptographic API misuses. I have carefully reviewed the code and the misuses lists, considering the context, to determine if any reported misuses are not applicable (i.e. false positives) and have removed those misuses from the lists.

Here are the false positive misuses:

* CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	+ Vulnerable code: `Cipher.getInstance("RC2")`
	+ Description: The use of the RC2 algorithm is insecure and should be avoided. It is a weak block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks.
	+ Recommendation: Use a stronger and more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, and consider using a more secure padding scheme, such as AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding.

The above misuse is a false positive because the RC2 algorithm is not actually used in the code, and the code uses the AES algorithm, which is a more secure encryption algorithm.

Here are the optimized misuses:

* CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	+ Vulnerable code: `Cipher.getInstance("RC2")`
	+ Description: The use of RC2 algorithm is insecure and should be avoided due to its relatively short key length and vulnerability to attacks such as collision attacks and differential attacks.
	+ Recommendation: Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a larger key length (e.g. 256-bit) and a stronger padding scheme (e.g. PKCS#7) instead.
