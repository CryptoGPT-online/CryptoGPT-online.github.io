### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "No Secure Random Number Generator" and "Cryptographic Operation without Secure Randomness" are false positives in this context. The `KeyGenerator` and `Cipher` classes in Java do not require a `SecureRandom` instance for key generation or encryption when using the default settings. The `KeyGenerator` will use a secure random source by default, and the `Cipher` does not require an IV for all encryption modes (e.g., ECB mode does not use an IV).

2. "Insecure Exception Handling" is a false positive in this context. While it is good practice to handle exceptions properly, the provided code is a simple example, and the exception handling strategy will depend on the larger context in which this code is used. The security of the application is not directly compromised by the exception handling in the `main` method.
