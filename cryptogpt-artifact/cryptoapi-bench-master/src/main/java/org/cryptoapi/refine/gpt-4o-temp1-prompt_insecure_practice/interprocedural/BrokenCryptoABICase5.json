### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Static Key/Algorithm References**

   The reported misuse regarding "Static Key/Algorithm References" involving mutable static variables does not apply in this context. The `crypto` and `crypto_algo` char arrays are being initialized using static references from `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` and `DEFAULT_CRYPTO_ALGO`. Since the application is using constants and appropriately assigning them before use, the risk of inadvertently modifying them is effectively mitigated in this particular context. Use of immutable references is generally advised, but the current setup with controlled static assignment does not expose any security risk specific to cryptographic misuse.
