Here are the analyzed cryptographic API misuses with the false positives removed:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse category": "Malformed URL Object Creation",
        "vulnerable_method": "Hd.go(String)",
        "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
        "description": "In this case, if the input is not a valid URL, a MalformedURLException can be thrown. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause the program to enter a failure state.",
        "recommendation": "Before creating a URL object, validate the URL string to ensure it is in a correct format. Use libraries such as URI to parse URLs safely."
    }
]
```

### False Positive Misuse ###

```json
[{"misuse": "Open Redirect", "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)", "description": "This line of code is creating a new URL object which can potentially be used in an open redirect attack. This means an attacker can manipulate the URL and redirect users to a different site.", "recommendation": "It is recommended to avoid creating URL objects from user-provided input, which could potentially be manipulated. If URL manipulation is necessary, it must be done in a safe and controlled manner, with proper validation and sanitization of inputs."}]
```

The Open Redirect misuse reported above is actually a false positive because the provided code does not involve any malicious redirect. The URL provided is hardcoded in the main method, so the code will always print the URL "https://www.google.com", regardless of the input. This is not vulnerable to an Open Redirect attack.
