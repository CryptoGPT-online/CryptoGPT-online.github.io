### False Positive Misuse ###
There is one false positive in the misuse list related to "Weak Key Length":

1. **Weak Key Length**
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `int keyLength = 16;`
   - **Explanation**: The key length specified is actually 16 bytes, not bits. PBEKeySpec uses values given in bytes/kilobytes for its key length parameter, which translates to 128 bits (16 bytes * 8 = 128 bits). Thus, this key length is appropriate for cryptographic use and is not a misuse.
