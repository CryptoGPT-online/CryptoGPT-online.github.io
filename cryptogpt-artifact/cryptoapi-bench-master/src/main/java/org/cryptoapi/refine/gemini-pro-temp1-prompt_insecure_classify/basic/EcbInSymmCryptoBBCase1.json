### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which is a block cipher mode that does not provide confidentiality. An attacker can easily break the encryption by analyzing the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter) mode instead of ECB."
