The first two misuse reports are false positives as the 'count' variable is not set directly by user input and there is an upper boundary check on 'choice' in the if statement. 

The last report, however, is a true positive and should be included in the optimized list. The iteration count is set to a high value (1050), which is not suitable for secure use, and can potentially lead to performance issues. This misuse should be corrected by reducing the iteration count to a more suitable value.

    {
        "misuse": "Insecure PBE Parameter",
        "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to a high value (1050). This may cause performance issues and potentially make it vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Reduce the iteration count to a more appropriate value. If you're using this code for cryptographic purposes, consider using a different algorithm like Argon2 that supports parameter tuning."
