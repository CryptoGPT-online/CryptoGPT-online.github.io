### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Vulnerable Code:** `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");`
**Description:** The AES key is generated without specifying the key size. By default, it will use a 128-bit key, which is considered weak and insecure.
**Recommendation:** Specify the key size explicitly when generating the key, and use a stronger key size such as 256 bits.

**Explanation:** This misuse is a false positive because the code does not generate the key yet. It only gets an instance of the key generator. The actual key generation happens in the next line, where a strong key size can be specified.

2. **Misuse:** Weak Padding Algorithm
**Vulnerable Code:** `cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);`
**Description:** Using ECB mode with PKCS5Padding is susceptible to padding oracle attacks. An attacker can potentially recover the plaintext by exploiting the predictability of the padding.
**Recommendation:** Consider using a more secure padding scheme, such as OAEP padding.

**Explanation:** This misuse is a false positive because the code does not specify the padding scheme. The default padding scheme used by the cipher is PKCS5Padding, which is secure when used with a block cipher mode that provides confidentiality, such as CBC or GCM. ECB mode, however, is not a secure block cipher mode and should not be used.
