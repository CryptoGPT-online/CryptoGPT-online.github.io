### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Hardcoded Crypto Algorithm" is not a false positive, but it is a design choice that may affect flexibility and security in the future. However, it is not a misuse in the context of the provided code snippet, as the algorithm is passed as a parameter to the `go` method.

2. "Missing IV for CBC mode" is a false positive because the code does not specify that CBC mode is being used. Without explicit mode specification, it defaults to ECB mode for which an IV is not required. However, ECB mode is not recommended for use.

3. "Weak Crypto Algorithm" is not a false positive per se, as Blowfish is indeed considered less secure than AES, but it is not inherently weak or broken. It is more about the relative strength compared to newer algorithms.

4. "Key Generation without Secure Random" is a false positive because the `KeyGenerator` class is designed to use a secure random number generator by default.
