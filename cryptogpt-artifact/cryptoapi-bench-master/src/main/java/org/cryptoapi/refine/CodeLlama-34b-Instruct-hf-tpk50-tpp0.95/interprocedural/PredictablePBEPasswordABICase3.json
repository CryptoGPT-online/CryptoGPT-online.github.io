 ## False Positive Misuses

* Misuse 1: Broken Crypto Algorithm (method2)
	+ Description: The PBEKeySpec and PBEParameterSpec classes are considered broken and should not be used.
	+ Recommendation: Replace PBEKeySpec and PBEParameterSpec with a more secure crypto algorithm, such as AES or RSA.

"description": "The use of PBEKeySpec with a low iteration count (11010) and a small key length (16) is considered broken and can be vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure crypto algorithm with a higher iteration count and a larger key length, such as PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512."
