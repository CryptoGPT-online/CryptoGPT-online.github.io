### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse related to "ECB Mode Usage" is a false positive. RSA is not a block cipher and does not use modes of operation like ECB, CBC, etc. The misuse list incorrectly states that Java defaults to RSA in ECB mode with PKCS1Padding, which is not applicable to RSA.

2. The misuse related to "String Encoding" is a false positive. The code is not using the `String(byte[])` constructor; it is using `new String("Secret Message")`, which does not involve byte arrays or character encoding issues.

3. The misuse related to "Use of ECB Mode" is a false positive for the same reason as the first point. RSA does not use ECB mode, and the default padding for RSA in Java is PKCS1Padding, not no padding.

4. The misuse related to "Direct Use of SealedObject" is a false positive. While it is true that SealedObject should be used with a secure Cipher instance, the provided code does not show any insecure use of SealedObject. The Cipher instances are initialized with RSA and the default padding, which is PKCS1Padding, not no padding.

5. The misuse related to "Direct Use of RSA for Bulk Data Encryption" is a false positive. The code is using `SealedObject` to encrypt a string message, which is a valid use case for RSA. The concern about RSA being used for bulk data encryption is valid, but the provided code does not show an example of encrypting bulk data with RSA.
