### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse related to the weak hash algorithm "MD4" is a false positive in this context. The code does initialize a `MessageDigest` instance with "MD4", but it is conditionally replaced with "SHA-256" if `choice > 1`, which is true in the given code. Therefore, the actual hashing algorithm used is "SHA-256", which is secure.
