    "description": "SHA-256 is a widely used cryptographic hash function, but it is not recommended for new applications due to security concerns. SHA-256 has been shown to be susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be used to compromise the security of applications that rely on SHA-256 for authentication or data integrity purposes.",
