    "description": "The key size for RSA encryption is set to either 1024 or 2048 bits, depending on the value of the `choice` variable. However, using a key size of 1024 bits is considered insecure for modern cryptographic applications, as it can be broken using readily available computing resources.",
    "recommendation": "Always use a key size of at least 2048 bits for RSA encryption, regardless of the value of the `choice` variable."
