 Here is the optimized misuse JSON with the false positive misuses removed:
```
{
    "misuses": [
        {
            "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
            "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
            "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is a broken crypto algorithm. It is not recommended to use this algorithm for any purpose as it is no longer considered secure.",
            "recommendation": "Use a secure crypto algorithm, such as SHA-256 or stronger, to ensure the security of the hashed data."
        }
    ]
}
```
The optimized misuse JSON includes only the misuse that was not a false positive, which is the use of the broken crypto algorithm in `MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)`.
