[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
        "description": "The code uses random.ints() to generate a password, which does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes. The generated password may be easily predictable or guessable.",
        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., java.security.SecureRandom) to generate a strong and unpredictable password."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), new String(keyBytes).toCharArray());",
        "description": "The code uses a weak password as the key to load the keystore. The strength of the encryption depends on the strength of the password. Using a weak password reduces the encryption strength and makes the system more vulnerable to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure password with sufficient length, complexity, and entropy to enhance the encryption strength of the keystore. Consider using a key derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2) with a high iteration count to strengthen the password-based key derivation process."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), new String(keyBytes).toCharArray());",
        "description": "The code is not properly validating the certificate of the remote server before loading it into the KeyStore.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation mechanism, such as X509TrustManager, to validate the certificate before loading it into the KeyStore."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
        "description": "The code is using the default algorithm 'JKS' for KeyStore which is considered outdated and less secure. It is recommended to use a more modern and secure algorithm such as 'PKCS12'.",
        "recommendation": "Use KeyStore.getInstance(\"PKCS12\"); instead of KeyStore.getInstance(type);"
