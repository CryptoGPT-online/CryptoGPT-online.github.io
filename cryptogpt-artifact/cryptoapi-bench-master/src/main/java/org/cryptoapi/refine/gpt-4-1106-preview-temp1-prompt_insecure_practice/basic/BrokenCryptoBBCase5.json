### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Missing Secure Random Number Generator" - This is a false positive because the Java `KeyGenerator` class is designed to use a secure random number generator by default if none is provided. Therefore, explicitly specifying a `SecureRandom` instance is not strictly necessary unless there is a specific requirement for a non-default source of randomness.

2. "Insufficient Key Size" - This is a false positive because IDEA has a fixed key size of 128 bits, which is generally considered secure for most applications. While it is true that some high-security applications may require larger key sizes, the IDEA algorithm does not support key sizes other than 128 bits, so this misuse is not applicable to the IDEA algorithm.
