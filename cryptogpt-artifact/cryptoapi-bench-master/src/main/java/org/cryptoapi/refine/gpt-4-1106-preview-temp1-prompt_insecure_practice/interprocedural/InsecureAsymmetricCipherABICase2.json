### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "ECB Mode in Cipher Instance" and "ECB Mode in RSA" are false positives. RSA is not a block cipher and does not use modes of operation like ECB or CBC. The "RSA" transformation string in `Cipher.getInstance("RSA")` does not imply ECB mode as it would with block ciphers. RSA operates on the entire block and does not have modes of operation in the same sense as block ciphers.

2. "Unused Variable" is a false positive. The variable `KEY_SIZE` is used in the methods `go2()` and `go3()`, which in turn affect the `keysize` variable that is used to initialize the `KeyPairGenerator`.
