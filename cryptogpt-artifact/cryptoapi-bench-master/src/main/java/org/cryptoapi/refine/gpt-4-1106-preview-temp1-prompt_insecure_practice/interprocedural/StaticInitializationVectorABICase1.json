### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Hardcoded Encryption Key" is a false positive because the key is not hardcoded; it is generated at runtime using `KeyGenerator.generateKey()`.
2. "Insufficient Error Handling" is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse. While proper error handling is important, it is not directly related to the cryptographic operations themselves.
3. "Use of a Hardcoded Cryptographic Key" is a false positive because the key is not hardcoded; it is dynamically generated.
4. "Hardcoded Key" is a false positive because the key is generated at runtime, not hardcoded.
