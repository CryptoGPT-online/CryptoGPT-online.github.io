### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - This misuse is a false positive as the code is using SecureRandom to generate random bytes for the salt value, and the length of the salt is dynamically generated using the line `byte [] salt = new byte[16];`. This provides sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - This misuse is a duplicate of the first report and can be removed.

3. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength - This misuse is a false positive as the iteration count value of 11010 is not necessarily low, and the report does not provide a clear context to determine the adequacy of the value.
