```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "`SecureRandom.setSeed(seed)`",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "Using a fixed seed for `SecureRandom` will result in a predictable sequence of random numbers, which can be exploited in cryptographic attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and provide it with a sufficient amount of entropy (e.g., from a hardware random number generator or a combination of multiple sources of randomness)."
