    "description": "The KeyGenerator class provides a mechanism for generating symmetric key material. When an instance of the KeyGenerator class is created, the algorithm random number generators are seeded. The problem here is that not only keyGenerator.generateKey() but also any other instances or static methods which generate random numbers are being seeded. This is not a cryptographic misuse per se but a potential vulnerability if the seeding algorithm is predictable or not secure.",
