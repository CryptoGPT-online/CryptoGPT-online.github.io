```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Weak Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "Using DES for encryption is not recommended as it is considered a weak encryption algorithm with known vulnerabilities. ECB mode is also not recommended due to its susceptibility to patterns in the input data. Using PKCS5Padding is also not a good practice as it is an outdated padding scheme.",
    "recommendation": "Use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of DES for better security. Use AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding or AES/GCM/NoPadding for more secure and recommended block cipher modes and padding schemes."
