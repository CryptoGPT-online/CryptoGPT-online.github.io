 ### False Positive Misuse JSON ###

[
    {
        "misuse": "Insufficient Randomness",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The random salt is generated using the Java SecureRandom class, which is not suitable for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. The size of the salt is also too small, which can make it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force the encryption key.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper cryptographic random number generator, such as the Java `SecureRandom` class, to generate the salt. Increase the size of the salt to at least 128 bits to make it more resistant to brute-force attacks."

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

        "description": "The use of PBEParameterSpec with a low iteration count can lead to vulnerabilities in the encryption algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 10000 or higher, to increase the computational complexity of the encryption algorithm and make it more resistant to brute force attacks."
