### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse**: Use of Weak Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-256)
   - **Vulnerable Code**: Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("Blowfish");
   - **Reason**: Blowfish is a legacy cipher that is no longer considered secure. However, in this case, it is used to encrypt data with a user-defined choice. If the user chooses a different, more secure cipher, this misuse is not applicable.
