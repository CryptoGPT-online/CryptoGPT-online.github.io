 Here is the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses in JSON format:

### False Positive Misuse ###

The following misuses are false positives:

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
	* Vulnerable code: `salt.toString()`
	* Description: The salt value is being used directly as a string, which may lead to predictable encryption and insecure keys.
	* Recommendation: Use a secure random number generator to generate the salt value, and ensure that it is properly stored and retrieved.

        "description": "The use of the PBEParameterSpec class with a static and weak salt value (12345) and a predictable iteration count (1020) is a security misuse.",
        "recommendation": "Use a strong and unique salt value for each user and a secure and unpredictable iteration count (at least 10,000) for better security."
