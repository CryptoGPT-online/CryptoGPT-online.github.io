Based on the provided code and misuse lists, below are the false positive misuses and the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses:

## False Positive Misuses

The misuse "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" with the description "The iteration count for the PBEParameterSpec is set to a static value of 20. This could be a low value or could be set as per user input and thus could be insecure." is false positive, because the iteration count is hardcoded and not directly dependent on user input or dynamic behavior. 

The misuse with description "The salt array used in the PBEParameterSpec is initialized with random bytes using SecureRandom. However, the number of bytes used for the salt is fixed at 32. While it is generally recommended to use a random salt of a certain length, using a fixed number of bytes could potentially make the salt weak or insecure." is also false positive, because the code is using a cryptographically secure random number generator (SecureRandom) to generate the salt.

[
    {
        "misuse category": "Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_method": "go(int count)",
        "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) iteration count is set using an input that can be manipulated by the user. As the iteration count increases, so does the time and resources needed to compute the derived key. Excessively low iteration counts may expose the system to brute-force attacks. It is recommended to use a minimum iteration count of 1000.",
        "recommendation": "Always set the iteration count to a value no less than 1000. You may also consider using an iteration count that scales with the computational resources of the system so that it remains secure regardless of hardware upgrades."
