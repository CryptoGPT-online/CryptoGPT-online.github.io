 The misuses JSON is as follows:

[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The crypto algorithm used is SHA1, which is a broken and risky algorithm. It is recommended to use a secure crypto algorithm such as SHA-256 or higher.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure crypto algorithm such as SHA-256 or higher."
  }
]

The other misuse reports are not relevant to the current context and are therefore removed.
