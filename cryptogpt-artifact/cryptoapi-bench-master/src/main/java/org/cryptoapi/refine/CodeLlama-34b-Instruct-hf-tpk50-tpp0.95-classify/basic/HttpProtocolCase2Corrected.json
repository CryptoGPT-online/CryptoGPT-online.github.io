 As an expert Java software security auditor, I analyzed the provided code and the misuse list associated with it. I identified two false positive misuses in the list and provided an optimized misuse list that contains only the remaining misuse that is not a false positive. The false positive misuses are:

1. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
The misuse is reported for the following line of code: `String url = "https://www.google.com";`
However, this is not a vulnerability as the hardcoded URL is not used for authentication or authorization, and it is not sensitive information.
2. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
The misuse is reported for the following line of code: `go(url)`
However, the `go` method uses the `new URL` method to create a URL object, which is a secure way to create a URL object. The `new URL` method is a secure method for creating a URL object, and it is not vulnerable to attacks that exploit a vulnerability in the algorithm used for URL parsing.

The remaining misuse in the optimized list is not a false positive, and it is still applicable to the provided code. The misuse is:

* CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
The misuse is reported for the following line of code: `go(url)`
The `go` method uses the `new URL(url)` constructor to create a URL object, which can potentially use an insecure algorithm for URL parsing. This can be a problem if the input URL contains malicious input that exploits a vulnerability in the algorithm.

The recommendation for this misuse is to use a secure URL parser library, such as the Java URL class, to ensure that the URL is parsed correctly and safely.
