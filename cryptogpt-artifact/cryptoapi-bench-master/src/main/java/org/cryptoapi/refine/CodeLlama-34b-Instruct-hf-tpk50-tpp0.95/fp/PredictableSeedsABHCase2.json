### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

{
"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);\nint v = sr.nextInt();",
"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate cryptographically strong random numbers, but in this code, it is being used with a predictable seed. This can make it easier for an attacker to guess the random numbers generated by the `SecureRandom` instance.",

Note: The optimized misuse JSON only includes the misuse that is not a false positive, which is the use of `SecureRandom` with a predictable seed. This misuse can be fixed by replacing `SecureRandom` with a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`.
