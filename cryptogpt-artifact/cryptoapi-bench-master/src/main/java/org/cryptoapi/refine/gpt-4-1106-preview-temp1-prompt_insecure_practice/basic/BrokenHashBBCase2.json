### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Insecure Hash Function Without Proper Encoding" and "Insecure Printing of Sensitive Data" are not necessarily security issues but rather usability issues. The code does not handle the binary data correctly for display purposes, but this does not constitute a cryptographic API misuse in terms of security. However, it is still a good practice to encode the output for readability.

2. "Insecure Hash Without Salt" is a false positive in this context because salting is typically used for storing passwords or other secrets to prevent precomputed dictionary attacks. In the provided code, there is no indication that the hash is being used for password storage or any other purpose that would require a salt.

3. "Ambiguous String to Byte Conversion" is a valid concern for consistency across different platforms, but it is not a security issue per se. It is more about ensuring that the hash is computed consistently regardless of the platform's default charset.
