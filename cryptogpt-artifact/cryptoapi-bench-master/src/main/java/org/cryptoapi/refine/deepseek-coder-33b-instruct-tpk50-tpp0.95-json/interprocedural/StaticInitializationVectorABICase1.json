        "description": "The code uses a key generator to generate a key for AES encryption. This is considered insecure because the KeyGenerator.getInstance() method uses the default random number generator, which is not secure and might be predictable. A better way is to use a secure random number generator or a key derivation function that generates random keys.",
        "recommendation": "You should replace the line 'KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");' with 'KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", \"BC\");' to use the Bouncy Castle provider, which has a secure random number generator. Or you can use KeyGenerator.init(int keysize, SecureRandom random) method to provide your own SecureRandom instance."

Preferably, the IV should be created and transmitted by secure means with the encrypted data. If reusing the IV needs to be done, you should ensure that the key is also not reused."

        "description": "Using a static, hard-coded IV in AES/CBC is considered a severe misuse because it allows attackers to perform a chosen-plaintext attack. In such an attack, an attacker can encrypt a chosen plaintext and observe the resulting ciphertext. If the same plaintext is encrypted again, the ciphertexts will be identical, revealing the IV.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a new, random IV for each encryption operation. You can do this by calling the SecureRandom class to generate a secure random IV each time."
