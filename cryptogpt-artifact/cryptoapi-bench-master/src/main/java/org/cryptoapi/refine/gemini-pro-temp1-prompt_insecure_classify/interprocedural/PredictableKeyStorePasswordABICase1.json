### False Positive Misuse ###
Following misuse is false positive:
{
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "`String key = \"changeit\";`",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded string as a key, which is not sufficiently random and can be easily guessed.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random key using a secure random number generator."
}
This misuse is false positive because the vulnerable code uses a hardcoded string as a key to access the keystore, not to generate a random value.
