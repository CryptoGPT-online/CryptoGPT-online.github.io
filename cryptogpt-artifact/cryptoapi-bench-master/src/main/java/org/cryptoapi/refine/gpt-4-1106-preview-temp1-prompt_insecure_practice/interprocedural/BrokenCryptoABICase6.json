### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Hardcoded Cryptographic Key" is a false positive. The variable `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` is not a cryptographic key but rather the name of the cryptographic algorithm. The name of the variable could be clearer, but it does not represent a misuse of a hardcoded key.

2. "Improper Initialization" is a false positive. The methods `go2()` and `go3()` are called in the correct order in the `main` method to initialize the `crypto` variable before it is used in `go()`. There is no incorrect order of initialization that would lead to a `NullPointerException`.

3. "Unencrypted Sensitive Data at Rest" is a false positive. The `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` variable stores the name of the algorithm, not sensitive data such as keys or secrets. While it's good practice to store sensitive configuration outside of the codebase, the name of the algorithm itself is not considered sensitive.
