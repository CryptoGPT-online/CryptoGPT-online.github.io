### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `String type = "JKS";`
   - **Reason:** The use of the JKS keystore type itself is not inherently insecure unless the context specifies the need for stronger protection against certain vulnerabilities. The suggestion to use PKCS12 is indeed better for password protection, but labeling JKS as a misuse without further context is not entirely accurate. In some environments, JKS might be acceptable depending on the use case and security requirements.
