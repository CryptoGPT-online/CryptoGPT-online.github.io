### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The first complaint about the `sr.nextBytes(bytes);` use potentially being improperly seeded. `SecureRandom` instance seeding is actually designed to be secure without manual seeding, as it pulls from sources provided by the underlying operating system. Unless there is evidence that the `SecureRandom` instance is not seeded securely by the implementation, it is not a misuse.
