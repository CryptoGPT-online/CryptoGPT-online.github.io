[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_method": "I1.go(String, int)",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostname,soc);",
    "description": "The SSLSocket is used without validating the SSL certificate. This can expose the system to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can present a fake certificate and the system would accept it.",
    "recommendation": "Always validate the SSL certificate. You could use the SSLSocket's startHandshake() method followed by getSession().getPeerCertificates() to retrieve the certificate. Then, you can validate it using a TrustManager."
