### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
   **Vulnerable Code:** `String key = hm.get("aaa");`
   **Description:** The code uses a hardcoded string ("aaa") to retrieve a key from a HashMap. This is a security risk because the key is now exposed in the code and could be easily compromised.
   **Recommendation:** Instead of hardcoding the key, it should be dynamically generated or retrieved from a secure source.
   
   **Reasoning:** This misuse is a false positive because the key is used to access a HashMap, not to load a keystore. This means that the key does not need to be secret, and it is not a security risk to hardcode it.
