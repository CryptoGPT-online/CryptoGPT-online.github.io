 ### False Positive Misuses

* Misuse: "Broken Crypto Algorithm"
	+ Vulnerable Code: "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\")"
	+ Description: "The `KeyGenerator` class is using the `RC2` algorithm, which is a broken encryption algorithm. It is no longer considered secure and should not be used for any purpose."
	+ Recommendation: "Replace `RC2` with a secure encryption algorithm, such as `AES` or `RSA`."

* Misuse: "Broken Crypto Algorithm"
	+ Vulnerable Code: "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\");"
	+ Description: "The code uses the RC2 encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for secure communication. RC2 is a weak block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to cryptanalysis."
	+ Recommendation: "Replace RC2 with a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES or Blowfish."

* Misuse: "Broken Crypto Algorithm"
	+ Vulnerable Code: "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\")"
	+ Description: "The use of RC2 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for encryption. It has been shown to be vulnerable to various attacks, including differential and linear cryptanalysis."
	+ Recommendation: "Replace RC2 with a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES."

### Optimized Misuse JSON

* Misuse: "Insecure IV Usage"
	+ Vulnerable Code: "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)"
	+ Description: "The initialization vector (IV) used for encryption is not properly generated and may not be random. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as ciphertext reuse and IV fixed attacks."
	+ Recommendation: "Use a properly generated and randomized IV for encryption, and ensure that it is unique for each encryption operation."

* Misuse: "Weak Key Generation"
	+ Vulnerable Code: "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();"
	+ Description: "The use of generateKey() method of KeyGenerator class is not secure as it creates a weak key. It is recommended to use a SecureRandom object to generate a secure key."
	+ Recommendation: "Use a SecureRandom object to generate a secure key."

* Misuse: "Insecure Cipher Mode"
	+ Vulnerable Code: "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\");"
	+ Description: "The use of RC2 encryption algorithm in cipher mode is insecure as it has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure cipher mode such as CBC or GCM."
	+ Recommendation: "Use a more secure cipher mode such as CBC or GCM."

* Misuse: "Broken Crypto Algorithm"
	+ Vulnerable Code: "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\");"
	+ Description: "The use of the RC2 algorithm is insecure and should not be used. It is a 64-bit block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks."
	+ Recommendation: "Switch to a more secure cipher such as AES, and use a higher block size such as 128 or 256 bits."
