  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The setSeed() method of SecureRandom class is used to set the seed of the random number generator. However, in this code, the seed is set using a static byte array, which provides insufficient randomness and can lead to predictable random number generation.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a static byte array, it is recommended to use a stronger source of randomness, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed() or SecureRandom.nextBytes(), to generate the seed for the random number generator."
