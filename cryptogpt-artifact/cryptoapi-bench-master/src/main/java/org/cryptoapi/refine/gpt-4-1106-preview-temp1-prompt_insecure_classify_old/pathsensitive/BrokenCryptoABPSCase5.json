### False Positive Misuse ###

- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values with `keyGen.generateKey()` is a false positive. Java's `KeyGenerator` class uses the platform's default secure random number generator to create keys. Unless there's a specific weakness known in a default RNG for a platform, assuming insufficient randomness is not justified in this code without additional context.

- CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation with `if (choice > 1) cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");` is a false positive. This code does not represent a negotiation; instead, it's a conditional algorithm selection based on program logic. Such a pattern, while not ideal, doesn't directly imply a vulnerability.
