### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.**
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));`
   - **Reason:** This report is a false positive because it highlights the use of ECB mode in the provided string `crypto`, not specifically the negotiation of algorithms. The primary security concern here is adequately covered by highlighting the weakness of the DES encryption in ECB mode, which constitutes a repetitive misuse already reported under CWE-327.

2. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.**
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto_algo)); SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();`
   - **Reason:** The report emphasizes likely issues with randomness in DES key generation. However, the problem is inherently due to the use of the DES algorithm itself, which is adequately captured by the CWE-327 classification. Hence, it overlaps with the existing misuse regarding the DES algorithm's insecurities and does not provide additional distinct issues.
