    "description": "The setSeed() method is used to set the seed of the SecureRandom instance. The seed should be a random value with sufficient entropy to provide strong randomness. However, in this code, the seed is initialized with a static byte array(DEFAULT_SEED), which may not provide sufficient randomness.",

    "description": "The code sets the seed for the SecureRandom instance using a byte array. However, the length of the byte array is only 2, which may not provide sufficient randomness for generating secure random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a longer and more random byte array as the seed for the SecureRandom instance."
