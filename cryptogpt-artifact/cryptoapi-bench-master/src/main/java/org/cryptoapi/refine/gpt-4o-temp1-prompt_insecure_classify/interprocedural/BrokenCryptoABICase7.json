### False Positive Misuse ###

None of the reported issues are false positives. The code demonstrably uses the RC4 algorithm, which is indeed considered broken and risky. Therefore, all the listed misuses are valid.

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"RC4\";",
        "description": "The code uses RC4, which is considered a broken and insecure cryptographic algorithm due to its vulnerabilities to various cryptographic attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Replace RC4 with a more secure algorithm, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which provides stronger encryption and is widely recommended for secure applications."
