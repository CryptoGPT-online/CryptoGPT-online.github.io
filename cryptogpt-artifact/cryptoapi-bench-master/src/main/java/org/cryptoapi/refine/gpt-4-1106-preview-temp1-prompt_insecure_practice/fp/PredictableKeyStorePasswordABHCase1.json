### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Insecure Randomness**: The code uses `SecureRandom` which is a cryptographically strong random number generator. The misuse report suggests that the randomness is predictable, which is incorrect because `SecureRandom` is designed to produce non-predictable output. However, the way the random numbers are converted to a string may not be ideal for password generation, but this is not due to the randomness being predictable.

2. **Hardcoded KeyStore Type**: The use of "JKS" as the KeyStore type is not inherently insecure. While "PKCS12" is a more modern format with some advantages, "JKS" is still widely used and supported. The recommendation to switch to "PKCS12" is valid, but the current use of "JKS" is not a misuse per se.

3. **Inadequate Exception Handling**: The misuse list mentions inadequate exception handling, but the provided code does not show any exception handling at all. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the exception handling is inadequate from the given code snippet.
