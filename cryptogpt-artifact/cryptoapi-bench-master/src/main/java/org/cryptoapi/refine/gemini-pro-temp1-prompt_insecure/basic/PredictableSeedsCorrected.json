### False Positive Misuse ### 

1. **"CWE-326: Inadequate Seeding of Random Number Generator" with vulnerable code "sr.setSeed(l);":** 
> This misuse is a false positive because the seed value `l` is generated using `sr.nextLong()`, which is a cryptographically secure way to generate a random number.
