### False Positive Misuse ###

- "Inadequate Key Length" is a false positive because the code provided does not involve any key generation or encryption process where key length would be relevant. The misuse is related to encryption keys, but the code is only using a hashing algorithm (MD5), which does not use keys in the same way encryption does.

- "Potential Insecure Hash Without Updating Salt" is a false positive in the context of this code because salting is a technique used primarily with password hashing to prevent precomputed dictionary attacks (rainbow tables). While it is a best practice to use salts with hashes for storing passwords, the code provided does not indicate that it is being used for password storage or any similar context where salting would be necessary.
