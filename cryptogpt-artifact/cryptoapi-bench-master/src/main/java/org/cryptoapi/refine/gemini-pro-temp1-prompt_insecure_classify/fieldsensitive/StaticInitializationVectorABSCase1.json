### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the misuses provided are false positives. All of them are potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed. The descriptions clearly explain the security concerns, and the recommendations are sensible and effective ways to mitigate the risks.

    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses `AES` algorithm with no key length specified, which defaults to 128 bits. This key length is considered insecure by modern standards.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key length, such as `AES/256` or `AES/192`."

    "description": "The code uses a constant value (`\"abcde\"`) to initialize the IV. This makes the IV predictable and allows for potential attacks.",
