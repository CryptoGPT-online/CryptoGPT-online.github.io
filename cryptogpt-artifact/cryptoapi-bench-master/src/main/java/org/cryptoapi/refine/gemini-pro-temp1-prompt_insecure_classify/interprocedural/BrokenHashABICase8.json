  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses the MD2 algorithm for message digesting, which is a weak and insecure algorithm. MD2 is known to be vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD2 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD2."
