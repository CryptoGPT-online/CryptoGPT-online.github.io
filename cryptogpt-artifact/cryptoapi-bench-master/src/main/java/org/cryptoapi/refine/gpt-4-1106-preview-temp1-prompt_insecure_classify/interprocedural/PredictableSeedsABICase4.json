### False Positive Misuse ###

Analyzing the misuse reports, we can identify false positives based on the analysis of the code provided and its secure coding practices. Specifically:

1. The `SecureRandom` instance is created with a seed derived from a hardcoded string (`"100"`), which is a legitimate security concern. This makes the generation of random values predictable, raising valid misuse under CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
   
2. The hardcoded seed (`"100"`) is a valid concern under CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials since hardcoded values, especially for cryptographic operations, can create predictable outcomes and security risks. Even if not used as traditional credentials (like passwords), hardcoding any part of a cryptographic operation can lead to vulnerabilities.

3. Regarding CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength, it says that the seed for `SecureRandom` is inadequate as it is derived from a fixed string and is not of sufficient length or complexity. Since `SecureRandom` is seeded with a predictable, non-random byte array converted from a string, it compromises the strength of the cryptography -- should SecureRandom be used for encryption or generation of secure keys.

Based on the false positive assessment above, it seems that all reported misuses are accurately identified and therefore, there are no false positives to remove.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

Given that there are no false positives identified, the list of misuses does not need to be optimized or modified. The provided misuse reports already raise concerns based on actual potential cryptographic API misuses. However, it is worth noting that the misuse descriptions are quite similar and overlap in the context of the randomness of the `SecureRandom` seed. For the sake of eliminating duplicated concerns and streamlining the report, we can consolidate related CWE entries into a single misuse report if desired.

Here is the consolidated JSON:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
        "description": "The SecureRandom instance is seeded with a static, non-random, and predictable byte derived from the hardcoded string '100', which compromises the entropy of the random values, making cryptographic operations predictable and weak.",
        "recommendation": "Allow SecureRandom to self-seed or provide a truly random seed value. Avoid using hardcoded and predictable data for seeding cryptographic operations to maintain adequate encryption strength and randomness."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_SEED = \"100\";",
        "description": "The seed for SecureRandom is hardcoded and may be construed as hardcoded credentials if the seed were used as a key or password, thus creating a security vulnerability by introducing predictability into the system.",
        "recommendation": "Do not hardcode seed values. Use dynamically generated values that are securely stored or retrieved to ensure cryptographic security."
