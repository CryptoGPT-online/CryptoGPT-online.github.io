### False Positive Misuse ###

- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values related to `Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");`, in the provided code `keyGen.generateKey();` is used to generate a key, and `Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");` is simply selecting the cipher algorithm and mode. This misuse item wrongly identifies the retrieval of Cipher instance as the point of insecurity with regards to randomness, which is actually dependent on key generation, not cipher instantiation. Thus, the misuse concerning the CBC mode and random values in this specific context is a false positive.
