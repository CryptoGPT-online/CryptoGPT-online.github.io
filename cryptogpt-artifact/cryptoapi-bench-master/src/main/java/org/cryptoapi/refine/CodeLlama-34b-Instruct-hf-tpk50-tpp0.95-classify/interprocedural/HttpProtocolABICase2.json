 As an expert Java software security auditor, I have carefully reviewed the provided code and identified potential misuses. After analyzing the context and code, I have determined that the following misuses are false positives and should be removed from the Misuse JSON:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
2. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials

These misuses are not applicable in the provided code as they do not involve cryptographic algorithms or hardcoded credentials.

The optimized Misuse JSON, without the false positive misuses, is as follows:
```json
{
    "misuses": [
        {
            "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
            "vulnerable_code": "url = URL;",
            "description": "The code selects a less-secure algorithm (char[]) for the URL without properly validating the input.",
            "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm (such as a secure hash function) to encode the URL before passing it to the `URL` constructor."
        },
        {
            "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
            "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url.toString())",
            "description": "The `URL` class in Java does not perform any validation of the certificate, which can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can intercept the traffic and modify the URL to redirect the user to a malicious website. It is recommended to use a library such as `javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection` to validate the certificate before connecting to the URL.",
            "recommendation": "Replace the `new URL(url.toString())` statement with a call to `HttpsURLConnection.connect(URL)` and check the certificate before connecting to the URL."
        }
    ]
}
```
Note that the misuse of CWE-757 is not related to the hardcoded URL, but rather to the lack of proper validation of the input when selecting the less-secure algorithm for the URL. The misuse of CWE-295 is not related to the hardcoded URL, but rather to the lack of certificate validation when connecting to the URL.

I hope this helps to identify and remove false positive misuses from the Misuse JSON.
