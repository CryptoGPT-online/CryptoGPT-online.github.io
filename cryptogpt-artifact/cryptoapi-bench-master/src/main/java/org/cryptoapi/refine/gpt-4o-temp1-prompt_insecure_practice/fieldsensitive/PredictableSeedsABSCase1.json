### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Predictable Seed**: 
    - **Vulnerable Code**: "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};"
    - **Reason**: Statement alone does not imply misuse unless the seed is explicitly used in the SecureRandom setSeed call, which is already covered by other entries clearly linked with setSeed usage.

2. **Predictable Seed for SecureRandom**: 
    - **Vulnerable Code**: "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200}; sr.setSeed(passedSeed);"
    - **Reason**: This misuse is redundant because it cannot exist without the context of explicitly passing a predictable seed to SecureRandom, which is addressed by other entries.

3. **Use of Predictable Seed in SecureRandom**: 
    - **Vulnerable Code**: "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200}; sr.setSeed(passedSeed);"
    - **Reason**: This entry duplicates the issue identified and explained in "Predictable Randomness (CWE-330)", which captures the broader context and implications.
