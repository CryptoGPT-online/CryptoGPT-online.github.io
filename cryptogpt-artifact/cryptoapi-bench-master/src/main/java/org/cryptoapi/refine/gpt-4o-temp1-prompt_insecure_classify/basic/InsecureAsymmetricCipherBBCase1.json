        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "int keysize = 1024;",
        "description": "The RSA key size is set to 1024 bits, which is considered cryptographically weak and can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a larger RSA key size, such as 2048 bits or more, to ensure adequate encryption strength."

        "description": "Using RSA directly for encryption is not recommended due to its vulnerabilities to certain attacks, such as padding oracle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a hybrid encryption scheme, such as RSA for encrypting symmetric keys and AES for the actual data encryption."
