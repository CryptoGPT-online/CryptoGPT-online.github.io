### False Positive Misuse ###

It appears that there is a false positive misuse in the code:
- In the condition where `choice > 1`, the salt does get randomized properly using `sr2.nextBytes(salt);`. However, since the salt is initially declared as one byte, the misconception is that it remains of this length even after being passed to `nextBytes`. This is not an issue as the salt is properly randomized within the condition. The actual problem should be the length of the salt rather than the randomness which is adequately addressed in the other misuse items.
