### False Positive Misuse ###

In this context, the multiple reports describing the same issue "Insecure Cipher Mode" due to using "AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding" can be seen as duplications of the same underlying problem. There are no distinct false positives, but the multiple entries can be consolidated for clarity.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Cipher Mode",
        "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
        "description": "Using ECB mode with AES is insecure because it encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks, which can reveal patterns in the plaintext.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption mode, such as AES/GCM/NoPadding or AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding, and ensure to use a random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation."
    }
