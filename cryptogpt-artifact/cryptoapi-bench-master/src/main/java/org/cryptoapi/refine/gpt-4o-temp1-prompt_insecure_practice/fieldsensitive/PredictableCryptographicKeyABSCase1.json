### False Positive Misuses ###

1. **Insecure Default Key Fallback**: The code falls back on using a default key if an empty key is provided. However, the design indicates that the `defaultKey` is only used if the key is not available, which effectively already falls under the misuse of "Hardcoded Cryptographic Key". 

2. **Encoding Not Specified for Text Bytes**: Although specifying encoding is a good practice to ensure consistent behavior, the platform-dependent behavior in this context is unlikely to lead to security vulnerabilities, because the actual encryption relies on a UTF-8 encoded key, which was specified correctly.
