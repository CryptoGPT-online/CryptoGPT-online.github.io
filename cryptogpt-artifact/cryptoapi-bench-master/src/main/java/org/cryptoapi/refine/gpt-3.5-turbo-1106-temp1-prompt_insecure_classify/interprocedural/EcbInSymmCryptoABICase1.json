### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
    "description": "The code uses ECB mode of operation which is generally considered insecure because it does not provide confidentiality for repeating patterns in the plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code allows for the selection of a cryptographic algorithm based on user input, which can lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the 'crypto' parameter is validated before passing it to the Cipher.getInstance() method. Restrict the allowed algorithms to those that are considered secure, and do not allow user-controlled input to specify an algorithm."
