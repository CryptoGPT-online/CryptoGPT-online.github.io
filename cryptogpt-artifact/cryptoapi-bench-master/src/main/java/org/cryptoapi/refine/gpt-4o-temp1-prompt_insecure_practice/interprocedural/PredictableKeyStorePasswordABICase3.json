### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Insecure SSL/TLS URL**:
     - *Reason*: The URL `https://www.google.com` is secure by default since it uses HTTPS, which inherently encrypts the connection. However, the main concern here should be validating the certificate to prevent MITM attacks, not necessarily the URL being insecure itself. The misuse related to 'Insecure SSL/TLS URL' overly simplifies what could truly manifest as a security risk associated with improper certificate validation or misconfigured setup.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Hardcoded Password",
        "vulnerable_code": "\"changeit\"",
        "description": "The use of a hardcoded password in the code poses a security risk as it can be easily extracted and used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access.",
        "recommendation": "Store and manage sensitive credentials securely outside the source code, such as in environment variables or a secure vault."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)",
        "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\"); ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
        "description": "The code loads a keystore from a URL without validating the certificate of the server. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Validate the server's certificate using a trusted CA or by implementing hostname verification to ensure the integrity of the server you are connecting to."
    }
]
```
Here, the concern regarding "Improper Certificate Validation" is retained because although the URL is secure, the key aspect is the absence of server certificate validation, which could still pose a significant security threat.
