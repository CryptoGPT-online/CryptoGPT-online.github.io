### False Positive Misuse 

CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

Misuse Code:
```java
String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());
```
Description: The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random numbers for cryptographic operations, but here it is used to generate a sequence of random integers, which is not secure.
Recommendation: You can generate a random string and convert it to a byte array to use as a secret key, but the `SecureRandom` class is better suited for this purpose.

### False Positive Misuse 

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
Misuse Code:
```java
SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
```
Description: The "AES" is a standard cryptographic algorithm but here it is used with a less secure key size.
Recommendation: AES should only be used with a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits, and a more secure key should be used.
