### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Small Salt Size" - The misuse report states that the salt size is 32 bits, which is incorrect. The code actually uses `byte[] salt = new byte[32];`, which means the salt is 32 bytes (256 bits), not 32 bits. This is an adequate size for a salt.

2. "PBEParameterSpec without Algorithm Parameters" - This misuse report is not accurate because PBEParameterSpec does not require an encryption algorithm to be specified. It is used to specify the salt and iteration count for PBE key derivation, not the encryption algorithm itself.

3. "Using a Static Salt" - This report is incorrect because the code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a new random salt each time, which is not static. The salt is not reused for different encryption operations within the scope of the provided code.
