### False Positive Misuse ###

- **Misuse:** Insufficient Key Length
  - **Vulnerable Code:** `pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey, salt, 10000, 16);`
  - **Reason:** The specified key length in the constructor `PBEKeySpec` is indeed 16, but the unit is in bits, which equates to 128 bytes (not 16 bits). This is a common misunderstanding, so this specific misuse can be considered a false positive.
