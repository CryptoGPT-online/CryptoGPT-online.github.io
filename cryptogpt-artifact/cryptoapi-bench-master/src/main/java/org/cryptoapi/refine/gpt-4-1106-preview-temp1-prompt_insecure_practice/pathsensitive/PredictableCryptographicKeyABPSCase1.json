### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Improper Initialization Vector (IV) Usage" - This is a false positive because the provided code snippet does not show any encryption or decryption operation, such as Cipher initialization, where an IV would be required. The misuse is related to the absence of an IV in encryption, but since encryption is not performed, this cannot be confirmed as a misuse.

2. "No Encryption/Decryption Procedure" - This is a false positive because the code snippet is only concerned with key generation and does not include any encryption or decryption logic. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether proper procedures are followed for encryption or decryption.

The optimized list consolidates similar issues and removes false positives related to IV usage and the absence of encryption/decryption procedures, which are not applicable to the provided code snippet.
