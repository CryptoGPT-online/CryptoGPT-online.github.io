        "description": "The KeyGenerator instance is created without specifying a provider, which may lead to the use of a weak or insecure implementation. Additionally, it is not explicitly initializing the key size, which could result in a default and potentially weak key length being used.",
        "recommendation": "Specify a provider for KeyGenerator.getInstance(), and explicitly initialize the key size to ensure a strong key is generated. Additionally, consider using a more secure encryption algorithm like AES instead of RC2."

        "description": "The code incorrectly specifies the \"RC2\" algorithm for creating the Cipher instance, but then overrides it with \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" based on the choice value. This can lead to confusion and potential insecure usage of the chosen algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the correct cipher algorithm is chosen based on the provided choice value and remove the initial incorrect specification of the algorithm."
