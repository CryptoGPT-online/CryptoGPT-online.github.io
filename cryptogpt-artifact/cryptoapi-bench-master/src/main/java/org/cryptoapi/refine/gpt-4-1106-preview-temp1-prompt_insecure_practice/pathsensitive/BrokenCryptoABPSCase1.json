### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse related to "Insecure Cipher Mode and Padding" and "Insecure Mode of Operation" for the DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding cipher is a false positive because the code actually uses AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding when `choice > 1`. However, the use of ECB mode is still a valid concern if `choice <= 1`.

2. The misuse related to "Weak Encryption Algorithm" is a false positive because the code is designed to use AES when `choice > 1`. The DES cipher is only used conditionally, and the primary concern should be the mismatch between the key and cipher algorithms, not the strength of DES itself in this context.

3. The misuse related to "Broken Crypto Algorithm" is a false positive because the code is designed to use AES when `choice > 1`. The DES cipher is only used conditionally, and the primary concern should be the mismatch between the key and cipher algorithms, not the brokenness of DES itself in this context.
