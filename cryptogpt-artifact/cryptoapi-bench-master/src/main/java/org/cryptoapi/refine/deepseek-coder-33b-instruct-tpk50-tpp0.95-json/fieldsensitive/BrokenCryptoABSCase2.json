## False Positive Misuses

1. "Inadequate Key Size": The key size is checked by an external linter, and not within the code.
2. "Weak Random Number Generation": The key generation is done through a secure method KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo) which follows secure randomness.
3. "Static Initialization Vector": The Cipher instance in Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo) is not static, so the IV might be dynamically generated for each encryption.

        "description": "KeyGenerator.getInstance() method is used to generate cryptographic keys. It is an insecure source of randomness as it uses the current time as a source of randomness. This may allow an attacker to predict future keys if they are able to guess when the KeyGenerator instance is created.",
