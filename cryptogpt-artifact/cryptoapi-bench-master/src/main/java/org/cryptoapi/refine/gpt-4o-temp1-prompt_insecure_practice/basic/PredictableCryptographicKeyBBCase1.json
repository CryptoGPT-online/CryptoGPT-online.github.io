### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Weak Key Size for AES / Insecure Key Size / Insufficient Key Length for AES**: 
   - While the 128-bit key size for AES is mentioned as weak, 128-bit keys are generally considered secure for AES encryption, given that they meet the standard specifications for AES-128. The primary concern should be the randomness and secrecy of the key, rather than the length in this context. Thus, the focus should shift to ensuring secure key management and generation rather than only key size.
