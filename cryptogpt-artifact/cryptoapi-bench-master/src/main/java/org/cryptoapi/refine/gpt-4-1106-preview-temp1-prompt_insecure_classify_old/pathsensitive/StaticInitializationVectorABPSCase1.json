### False Positive Misuse ###

- The misuse related to "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" reported for `sr.nextBytes(bytes);` where `SecureRandom` is used without proper seeding is a false positive. The `SecureRandom` class is designed to self-seed, and calling `nextBytes()` will produce a sufficiently random value even if no seed is manually set. This is considered a cryptographically strong random value suitable for generating an IV for CBC mode encryption.

- The code correctly branches on the value of `choice`, generating a random IV if `choice` is greater than 1. When `choice` is not greater than 1, the IV generation from `"abcde"`.getBytes()` is indeed insecure, and this misuse was reported correctly in several places. Only one instance of this report will be kept, as the others are duplicates.

- The misuse regarding the key size for AES (CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength): The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) defaults to a key size of 128 bits when no key size is specified, which may be adequate for many applications. However, for stronger encryption, a larger key size (such as 256 bits) is recommended. The misuse reporting the unspecified key size is legitimate but also contains duplicates.
