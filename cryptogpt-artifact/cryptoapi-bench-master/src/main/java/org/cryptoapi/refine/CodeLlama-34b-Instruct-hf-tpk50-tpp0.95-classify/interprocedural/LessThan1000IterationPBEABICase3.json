 Here is the optimized misuse list in JSON format:

[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The generated salt is not cryptographically secure because it is based on the output of a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) instead of a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).",
        "recommendation": "Use a CSPRNG like SecureRandom instead of a PRNG like Random to generate the salt."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);\npbe = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The use of a fixed length of 32 bytes for the salt value is not sufficient for secure encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the salt size to a larger random value, such as 128 bytes."
    }
]

The misuses "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" and "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" have been removed from the optimized misuse list as they are false positives.
