  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"MD2\";",
    "description": "The code uses MD2 as the default cryptographic algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Change the default cryptographic algorithm to a more secure one, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "md.update(str.getBytes());",
    "description": "The code uses a single iteration of the default cryptographic algorithm to hash the input string, which may not provide sufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to enhance the encryption strength."
