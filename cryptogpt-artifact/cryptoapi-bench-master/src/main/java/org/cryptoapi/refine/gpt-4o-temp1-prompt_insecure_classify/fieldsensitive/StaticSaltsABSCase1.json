### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. Both issues highlighted are genuine concerns as they pertain to cryptographic practices that do not provide sufficient security measures:
- The use of a very short hardcoded salt (1 byte) does indeed lead to vulnerabilities as it makes it easier for attackers to predict and reverse the encrypted data.
- The iteration count of 1020 for PBE is very low and would not provide significant computational security against brute force attacks.
