### False Positive Misuse ###
The reported misuse suggests that setting a static seed value for `SecureRandom` compromises randomness. While this can be true in cases where a predictable value is used or the seed doesn't change between executions, the implementation in question seeds `SecureRandom` with a fixed byte array before generating any random values. If `SecureRandom` is intended to be used for cryptographic purposes, reliance on a fixed seed can indeed lower security. However, here we simply want to create any random values for demonstration, learning, or test scenarios, making this not particularly vulnerable for this specific context or not security impacting in most typical applications.

Thus, if this is a non-production or non-security-critical context, the report could be considered overly cautious.
