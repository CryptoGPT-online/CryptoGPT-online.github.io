### False Positive Misuse ###

In this case, none of the reported misuses can be considered false positives. The use of the MD4 algorithm is indeed a broken cryptographic practice due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. Therefore, all the misuse reports correctly identify the vulnerability in the code.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
        "description": "MD4 is a broken cryptographic hash function and is considered insecure for hashing purposes as it is vulnerable to collision attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead of MD4."
    }
]
```

The optimized list condenses all reports that point out the use of MD4 as a broken algorithm. This highlights the single cryptographic misuse for clarity and efficiency.
