### False Positive Misuses ###

- **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
  - Vulnerable Code: `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();`
  - Explanation: The misuse is not applicable since the code generates a new key using `keyGen`. While it's true that `AES` by itself is not sufficient for strong encryption, it is important to consider the context. In this case, the code itself generates a new key and does not hard-code any key material.

- **CWE-256: Plaintext Data Exposure**
  - Vulnerable Code: `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");`
  - Explanation: This misuse is not applicable because the vulnerable code uses `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding`, which is a secure encryption mode that protects data from plaintext exposure.
