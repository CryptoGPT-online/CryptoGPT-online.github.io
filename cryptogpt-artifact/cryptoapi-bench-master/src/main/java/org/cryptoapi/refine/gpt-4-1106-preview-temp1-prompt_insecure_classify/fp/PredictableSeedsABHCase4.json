### False Positive Misuse ###

The reported misuse regarding "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" based on the values 300 and 400 being stored in a `Byte`, which leads to integer overflow, is a false positive. The actual integer overflow that occurs when casting an integer larger than the maximum value of a byte in Java (127) to a byte does not relate to the cryptographic strength or encryption directly, but rather it is a programming error. The code listings mention the storage of these values but do not directly link them to cryptographic operations. They are simply placed into a map and one value is used for seeding a `SecureRandom` instance. The integer overflow is an issue, but it is not a cryptographic misuse in the context of the provided code.
