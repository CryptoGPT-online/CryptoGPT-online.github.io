### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. The issue identified with using a static seed in the `SecureRandom` constructor is valid in all the provided misuse reports. As described, this practice makes the random numbers predictable, which can compromise security.

        "recommendation": "Avoid seeding SecureRandom with static values. Use the default constructor of SecureRandom which provides a more unpredictable source of randomness."
