### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Hardcoded Crypto Algorithm**: 

   - This misuse suggests that the hardcoded algorithm leads to inflexibility and security risks. However, in the provided context, hardcoding isn't directly a security flaw but rather a design choice. The recommendation is to use configuration files or secure external sources, which is more about design flexibility rather than a misuse in encryption security.
