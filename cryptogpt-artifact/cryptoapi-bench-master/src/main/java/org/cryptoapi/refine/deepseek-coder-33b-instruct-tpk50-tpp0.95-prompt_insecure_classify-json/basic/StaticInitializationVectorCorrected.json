        "description": "The IV (initialization vector) used for CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode should be a random, unpredictable number. Using a deterministic random number generator (like 'SecureRandom') to generate a byte array isn't sufficient. It could be predicted by an attacker and result in weaker encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using SecureRandom's nextBytes() method to generate the IV, a method that produces a high-quality random number, such as a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) should be used."
