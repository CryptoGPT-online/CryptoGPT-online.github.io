### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: Weak Cipher Mode**
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");`
   - **Reason**: The report states a weakness due to lack of additional security measures such as HMAC for integrity. However, the code snippet already replaces the Blowfish algorithm with AES in CBC mode when `choice > 1`, and Blowfish is the actual primary issue. The critique on using AES is a bit misleading since it's an improvement over Blowfish, which is an actual weak algorithm. Additionally, without seeing the full production code dealing with IVs and not just the snippet, it's not clear if the IV management is indeed improper.

2. **Misuse: Static Key Usage**
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();`
   - **Reason**: The code snippet is only shown generating a key for immediate use and not being reused or handled across sessions, which might not constitute "static key usage" as described. Without additional context showing repeated re-use or poor key lifecycle management, this report is speculative.
