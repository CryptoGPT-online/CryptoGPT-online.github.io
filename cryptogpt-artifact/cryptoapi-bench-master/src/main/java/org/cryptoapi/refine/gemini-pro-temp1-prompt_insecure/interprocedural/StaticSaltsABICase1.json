### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse:** CWE-326: Inadequate Password Strength
**Reason:** The provided code creates a PBEParameterSpec object, which is used to generate encryption keys. The number of iterations specified in the PBEParameterSpec is 1020, which is greater than the minimum recommended value of 1000. Therefore, this misuse is a false positive.

2. **Misuse:** Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)
**Reason:** The provided code uses the PBEParameterSpec class, which is not deprecated. The PBEParameterSpec class is used to generate encryption keys, and it is not a cryptographic algorithm itself. Therefore, this misuse is a false positive.
