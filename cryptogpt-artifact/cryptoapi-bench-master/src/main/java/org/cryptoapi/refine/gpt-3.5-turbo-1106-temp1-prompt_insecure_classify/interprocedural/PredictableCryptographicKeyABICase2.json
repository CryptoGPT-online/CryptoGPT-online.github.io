  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16); SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using a fixed-size key of 16 bytes for AES encryption, which is a weak key size. AES encryption is recommended to use a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits depending on the security requirements.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a secure random key with a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits for AES encryption."

    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = encryptKey.toString().getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The encryption key, derived from the encryptKey variable, has a fixed length of 16 bytes. This may not provide sufficient encryption strength depending on the specific use case.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key generation algorithm to generate a random encryption key with a recommended length for the chosen encryption algorithm."

    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = \"defaultkey\";",
    "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded in the code, making it easily discoverable for attackers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to store and retrieve the encryption key, such as using a key management system or storing the key in a protected configuration file."
