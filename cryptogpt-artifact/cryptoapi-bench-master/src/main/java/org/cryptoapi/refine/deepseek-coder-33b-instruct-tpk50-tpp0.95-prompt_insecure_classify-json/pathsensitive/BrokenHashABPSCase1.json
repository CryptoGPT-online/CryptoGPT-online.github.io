False Positive Misuse:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
        "vulnerable_code": "if(choice>1) \n\t\t md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
        "description": "This code might lead to insecure use of SHA-256 algorithm due to a 'choice' variable. This could lead to a 'time-of-check to time-of-use' (TOCTTOU) race condition.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the choice of algorithm should be static and does not change during execution. Use hardcoded values and not user controlled ones."
    }
]
```
Explanation: In this case, the algorithm choice is not based on any user input or a dynamic condition, but just on the value of the 'choice' variable. This 'choice' variable is statically defined and the condition for its value is not depended on any user input or a dynamic variable, therefore it would not be a "time-of-check to time-of-use" (TOCTTOU) race condition.

Optimized Misuse JSON:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
        "description": "The SHA1 hash algorithm is considered no longer secure and is easily breakable. Use of this algorithm could lead to data integrity issues.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using stronger algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
```
Explanation: Here, 'SHA1' is used for message digest. Even though it is not secure and should be avoided, it is not vulnerable to 'time-of-check to time-of-use' (TOCTTOU) race condition because the condition for its choice is neither dynamic nor based on user input. Therefore, it is a false positive.
