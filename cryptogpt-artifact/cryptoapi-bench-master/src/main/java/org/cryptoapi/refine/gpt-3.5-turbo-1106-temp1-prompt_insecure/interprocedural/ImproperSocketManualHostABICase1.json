### False Positive Misuse ###
None

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
{
  "misuse": "Hardcoded Credentials",
  "vulnerable_code": "String hostname = \"my.host.name\";",
  "description": "The hostname is hardcoded in the code, which could lead to exposure of sensitive information if the code is shared or exposed.",
  "recommendation": "Use configuration files or environment variables to store sensitive information like hostnames and credentials."
},
{
  "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
  "description": "Using the getDefault() method may result in using insecure or outdated SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites, as it may not always provide the strongest encryption available.",
  "recommendation": "Explicitly specify the SSLContext and its configuration to ensure the use of the most secure SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites."
},
{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
  "description": "The code uses the getDefault() method of SSLSocketFactory, which may not always return a secure implementation. It could potentially return a weaker or vulnerable SSL/TLS implementation.",
  "recommendation": "Use a specific SSL context with appropriate secure protocols and algorithms instead of relying on the default implementation."
