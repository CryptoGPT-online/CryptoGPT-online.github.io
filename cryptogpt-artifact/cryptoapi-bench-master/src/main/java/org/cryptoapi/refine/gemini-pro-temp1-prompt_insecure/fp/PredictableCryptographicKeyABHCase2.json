### False Positive Misuse ###


- **Insufficient Padding of Ciphertext**

  This misuse is a false positive. While it is generally good practice to use a secure padding scheme, using `Arrays.copyOf()` to pad the key is sufficient in this case because the key is being used to encrypt a small, fixed-size value.


- **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**

  This misuse is a false positive. The key size used in this case (128 bits) is sufficient for most practical purposes. Using a larger key size would not provide any significant benefit in terms of security.


- **CWE-327: Use of a Weak or Insecure Cipher**

  This misuse is a false positive. AES is a strong and secure cipher. There is no need to use a different cipher in this case.
