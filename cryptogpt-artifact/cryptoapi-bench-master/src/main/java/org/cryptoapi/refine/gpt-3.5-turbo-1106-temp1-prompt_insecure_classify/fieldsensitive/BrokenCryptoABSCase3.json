```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C4(\"RC4\");",
    "description": "The code is using the RC4 encryption algorithm, which is considered insecure and vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm like AES instead of RC4."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The code is using a default key size for generating the encryption key, which may result in a weak key with insufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a sufficient key size (e.g., 128 bits or higher) when generating the encryption key to ensure stronger encryption strength."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto.encrypt(\"abc\",\"\");",
    "description": "The encryption method is called with an empty string as the algorithm parameter.",
    "recommendation": "Use a securely generated algorithm parameter or let the user specify the algorithm."
