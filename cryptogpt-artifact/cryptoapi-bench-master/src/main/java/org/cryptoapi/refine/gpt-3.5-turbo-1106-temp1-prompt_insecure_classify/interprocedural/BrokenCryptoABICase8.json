    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))\nCipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "description": "The code uses a static char[] crypto to determine the cryptographic algorithm name, which can lead to the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm if the value of crypto is not properly controlled. The value of 'crypto' is not properly initialized and may lead to the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a constant string variable initialized with a specific and secure cryptographic algorithm name such as AES."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"RC2\";",
    "description": "The code defines a constant 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO' which is used as the default cryptographic algorithm. However, using a hardcoded value for the cryptographic algorithm is considered a misuse as it limits flexibility and makes it harder to update and change the algorithm in the future.",
    "recommendation": "Use a configuration mechanism to specify the default cryptographic algorithm, allowing flexibility and ease of future updates."
