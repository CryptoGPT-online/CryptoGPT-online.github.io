### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Lack of Secure Randomness" - The misuse related to not specifying a secure random number generator for key generation is a false positive. The `KeyGenerator` class in Java defaults to using a secure random source for key generation. Unless there is a specific requirement or known issue with the default `SecureRandom` implementation, this is not a misuse.

2. "Insufficient Key Size" - The misuse related to not specifying a key size for AES is a false positive. While it is true that specifying a key size is a good practice, the default key size for AES in Java is 128 bits, which is considered secure. Therefore, this is not a misuse unless there is a specific requirement for a larger key size.

3. "Static crypto algorithm specification" - The misuse related to hardcoding the cipher algorithms is a false positive in the context of this code snippet. While it is generally a good practice to avoid hardcoding and allow for configurability, the code does not indicate that the algorithm is influenced by an attacker or external control. The hardcoded value is used in a controlled manner within the `main` method.

4. "Potential hardcoded sensitive information" - This is a false positive because the string "AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding" represents the algorithm, mode, and padding, and not sensitive information. However, the use of ECB mode is a valid concern and is correctly identified as a misuse.

5. "Lack of secure random IV for CBC mode" - This is a false positive because the code is not using CBC mode; it is using ECB mode. The recommendation is valid for CBC mode, but since CBC mode is not used, this specific misuse does not apply.
