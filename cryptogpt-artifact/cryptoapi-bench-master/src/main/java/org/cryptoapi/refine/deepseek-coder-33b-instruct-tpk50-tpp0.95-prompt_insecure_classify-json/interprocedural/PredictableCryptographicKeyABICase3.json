The false positive misuses are:
1. "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values": The use of a hardcoded key is not a false positive.
2. "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials": Using a hard-coded string as a cryptographic key is not a false positive.
3. "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm": It's not a false positive, but a good practice to use a secure key derivation function, like PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to derive a key from a password or other secret information.

Here is the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
        "description": "The default key used in the program is not secure as it is hardcoded and can lead to potential vulnerabilities. AES requires 16, 24 or 32 byte keys and the provided key does not meet this criteria.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the hardcoded key with a securely generated random key. Use SecureRandom class for random key generation or use a key management system if this is for a product."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
        "description": "Using a hard-coded string as a cryptographic key can lead to security issues. If the key is leaked, it can be used to decrypt the data. It can also cause confusion and miscommunication.",
        "recommendation": "It's highly recommended to store sensitive data such as keys in secure storage, not in the code or version control system. Alternatively, use an external secure configuration file."
    }
]
