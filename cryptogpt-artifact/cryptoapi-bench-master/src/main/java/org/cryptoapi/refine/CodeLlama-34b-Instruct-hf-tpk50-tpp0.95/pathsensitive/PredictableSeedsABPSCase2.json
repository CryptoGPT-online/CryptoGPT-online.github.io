"misuse": "Insecure Use of SecureRandom",
"vulnerable_code": "if(choice>1) sr2.nextBytes(seed);",
"description": "The code uses SecureRandom without properly seeding it, which makes it insecure. The SecureRandom class uses a seed to generate pseudorandom numbers, but if the seed is not properly generated, it can be predicted and the numbers can be forged. In this case, the seed is set to a constant value, which makes it easy to predict.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the code should use a secure seed, such as one generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator, and should not use a constant seed. Additionally, the code should be careful to use the SecureRandom class correctly, such as by using the `nextInt` method instead of `nextBytes`."

"description": "The SecureRandom class is not suitable for generating random numbers, and it is recommended to use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator instead.",
