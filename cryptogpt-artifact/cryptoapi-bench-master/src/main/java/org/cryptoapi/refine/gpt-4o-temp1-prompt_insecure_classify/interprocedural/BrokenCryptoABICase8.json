### False Positive Misuse ###
None. All the reported misuses relate to the use of RC2, which is indeed a weak algorithm and accurately reported as insecure.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"RC2\";",
        "description": "The code uses RC2 for cryptographic operations, which is considered a weak algorithm due to its vulnerability to modern cryptographic attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the RC2 algorithm with a more secure alternative like AES (e.g., \"AES\")."
