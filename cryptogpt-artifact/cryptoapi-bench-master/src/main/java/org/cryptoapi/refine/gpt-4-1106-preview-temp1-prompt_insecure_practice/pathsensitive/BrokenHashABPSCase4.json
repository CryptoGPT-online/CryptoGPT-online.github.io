### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse related to the weak hashing algorithm "MD2" is a false positive in this context because the code does switch to "SHA-256" if the `choice` variable is greater than 1. Since the `choice` variable is hardcoded to 2, the "MD2" algorithm is never actually used. However, if the `choice` variable were to be controlled externally, then this would be a valid concern.

The misuse related to "Potential Insecure Algorithm Selection" is also a false positive under the assumption that the `choice` variable is not externally controlled. In the provided code snippet, the `choice` variable is hardcoded and will always result in the selection of "SHA-256".

The misuse related to "Platform Default Encoding" for `name.getBytes()` is not a false positive. It is a valid concern that should be addressed to ensure consistent behavior across different platforms.
