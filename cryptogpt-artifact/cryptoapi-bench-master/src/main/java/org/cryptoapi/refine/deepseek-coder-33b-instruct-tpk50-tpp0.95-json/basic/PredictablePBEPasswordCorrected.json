### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Weak PBE key",
        "vulnerable_code": "new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength)",
        "description": "The provided iterationCount and keyLength values make the key derivation process slower, which can reduce the overall security of the key. This is a weak PBE key and weakens the system's security.",
        "recommendation": "Consider increasing the iterationCount and using a larger keyLength value. It's recommended to use 10000 as a base value and increase or decrease based on the computational resources available for the application."

        "misuse": "Buffer overflow",
        "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
        "description": "Incorrect handling of password generation that may lead to buffer overflow.",
        "recommendation": "Use secure ways to generate random passwords, limit their size or use SecureRandom class."
