[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C5(\"RC2\");",
        "description": "RC2 is considered insecure and should not be used for encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm like AES."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Key Generation",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo); SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
        "description": "The KeyGenerator should not be used to generate a key for the RC2 algorithm as it is considered insecure. Moreover, the KeyGenerator is initialized with the default algorithm, which may not be secure. Also, the key is generated without specifying any key size or strength.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure key generation method such as key derivation functions (KDFs) or key management systems (KMS) to generate keys for encryption. Alternatively, use a secure and specific key generation algorithm like AES with an appropriate key size."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo); SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
        "description": "The KeyGenerator.getInstance() is used without specifying a secure random number generator (RNG), which may result in using a weak or predictable key. Additionally, it's unclear whether the key length is specified, which may result in a default and potentially insecure key length.",
        "recommendation": "Use a specific instance of SecureRandom when generating the key. For example, use SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to obtain a secure random number generator (RNG) algorithm."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Encryption",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
        "description": "The encryption is being performed without specifying any padding mechanism. Depending on the algorithm and mode, this can lead to padding oracle attacks and other vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Always specify a secure padding mechanism when initializing the Cipher instance to ensure secure encryption, for example, using AES/GCM/NoPadding mode for authenticated encryption."
