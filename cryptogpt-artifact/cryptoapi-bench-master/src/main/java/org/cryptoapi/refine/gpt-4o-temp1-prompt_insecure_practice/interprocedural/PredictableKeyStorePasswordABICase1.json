### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Trusting Known Certificate** / **Trusting All Certificates** / **Insecure Communication Channel** / **Use of Primitive URL Scheme** / **Insecure URL Usage**:
   - **Reason**: While the potential misuse reports highlight the risks associated with loading a keystore from an external URL, the actual issue hinges on the lack of certificate validation. There is no explicit mention in the original code or misuse lists that advises against loading keystores over HTTPS. The misuse revolves around not performing additional certificate validation, potentially leading to MITM attacks. However, the misuse might have been incorrectly articulated across multiple similar categories. Therefore, as long as HTTPS and proper certificate validation procedures are well implemented, this issue may not strictly pertain to the code directly provided.
