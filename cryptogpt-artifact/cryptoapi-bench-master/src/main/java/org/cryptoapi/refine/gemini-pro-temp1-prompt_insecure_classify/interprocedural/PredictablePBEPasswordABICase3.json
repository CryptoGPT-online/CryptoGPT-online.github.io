[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "P3.method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length of 16 bytes (128 bits) is considered to be insufficient for secure encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 256 bits (32 bytes)."

    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "P3.method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not properly seeded, which may result in insufficient randomness in the generated salt. This can weaken the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate the salt. Additionally, consider using a larger salt size (e.g., 32 bytes) to further enhance the security."
