### False Positive Misuse ###

None of the reported misuses are considered false positives. The code clearly shows misuse of the `SecureRandom` API by seeding it with a predictable, fixed value. This compromises the security as it undermines the randomness expected from `SecureRandom`, which should ideally be seeded with a source of high entropy.
