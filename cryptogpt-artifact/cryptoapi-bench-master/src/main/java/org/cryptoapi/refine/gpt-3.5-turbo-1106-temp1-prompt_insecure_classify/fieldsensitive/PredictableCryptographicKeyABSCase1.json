    "description": "The key size is hardcoded to 16 bytes, which is considered to be insufficient for the AES algorithm. It is recommended to use a key size of at least 128 bits (16 bytes) for AES.",
    "recommendation": "Use a key size of 128 bits or higher, and ensure that the key size is configurable or derived from a secure source of randomness."

    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new Co(\"defaultkey\");",
    "description": "The code is using a hardcoded key (\"defaultkey\") to initialize the encryption algorithm. Hardcoded keys make it easier for attackers to guess the key and undermine the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random key at runtime or use a secure key management system to retrieve keys."
