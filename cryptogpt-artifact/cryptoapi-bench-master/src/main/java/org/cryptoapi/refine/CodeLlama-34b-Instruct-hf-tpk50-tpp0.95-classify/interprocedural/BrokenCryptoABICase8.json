 I have analyzed the provided code and found that the following misuses are not applicable and can be removed from the JSON response:

* CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation (reported in the second and fourth lists): The algorithm used for negotiation is `RC2`, which is already considered insecure.

Here is the optimized JSON response:
