## False Positive Misuse 
{
  "misuse category": "Inadequate use of Cryptographic Hashing Function",
  "vulnerable_method": "B1.main(String [])",
  "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
  "description": "The use of SHA1 for hashing is considered weak and insecure. It is now known to have collision vulnerabilities. Using a stronger algorithm like SHA-256 or higher is recommended.",
  "recommendation": "Replace \"SHA1\" with a stronger hashing algorithm like \"SHA-256\" or \"SHA-3\"."

## Optimized Misuse JSON
{
  "misuse category": "Incorrect Usage of SHA1",
  "vulnerable_method": "B1.main(String [])",
  "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
  "description": "The SHA1 algorithm is considered as broken and should not be used for anything related to cryptography or security. Instead, you should use a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256, SHA-3.",
  "recommendation": "Replace 'SHA1' with 'SHA-256' or 'SHA-3' when creating the MessageDigest instance."
}

The above response includes only the misuses that are considered false positives and optimized misuses. False positives are misuses in the misuse lists which are not relevant to the provided Java code. The optimized misuse JSON is only a misuse related to the provided code snippet.
