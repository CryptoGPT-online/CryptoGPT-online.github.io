[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C4(\"MD2\");",
    "description": "The code is using the MD2 cryptographic algorithm which is considered broken and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or AES."
  },

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto.encrypt(\"abc\",\" \");",
    "description": "The code uses an empty string as the encryption algorithm, which may result in weak encryption. The encryption algorithm should be passed as a parameter and not be left empty.",
    "recommendation": "Always provide a valid and secure encryption algorithm when encrypting data."
