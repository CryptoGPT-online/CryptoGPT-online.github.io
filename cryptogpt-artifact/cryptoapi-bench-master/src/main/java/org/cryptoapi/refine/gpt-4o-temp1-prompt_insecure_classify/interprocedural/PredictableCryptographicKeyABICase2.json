### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Misuse: "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength." (First Occurrence)
   - Vulnerable Code: `public static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = "defaultkey";`
   - Analysis: This report is a false positive because it overlaps with the hardcoded credential misuse (CWE-798). The issue here is the hardcoded nature of the key and not its direct inadequacy of encryption strength. 
   
2. Misuse: "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials." (Duplicated Occurrences)
   - Vulnerable Code: `public static final String DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = "defaultkey";`
   - Analysis: The hardcoded credential issue repeats multiple times, bringing duplicate entries. Multiple reports do not bring more clarity or actionable information, hence considered a false repetition.
