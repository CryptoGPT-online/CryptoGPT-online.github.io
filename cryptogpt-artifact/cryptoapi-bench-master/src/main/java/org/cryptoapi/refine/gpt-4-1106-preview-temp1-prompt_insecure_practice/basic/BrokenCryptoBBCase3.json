### False Positive Misuse ###

- The misuse related to "Insufficient Key Size" is a false positive in this context. The RC4 algorithm does not have a variable key size in the same way that AES does. The key size for RC4 is typically between 40 and 2048 bits, and the `KeyGenerator` for RC4 will generate a key of a default size that is considered standard for RC4, which is usually 128 bits or more. Therefore, the concern about not specifying a key size is not applicable to RC4.

- The misuse related to "Lack of Secure Random Number Generator" is also a false positive. While it is true that using a secure random number generator is important, the `KeyGenerator` class in Java already uses a secure random source by default. Unless there is a specific requirement to use a different source of randomness, the default behavior of `KeyGenerator` should not be considered a misuse.
