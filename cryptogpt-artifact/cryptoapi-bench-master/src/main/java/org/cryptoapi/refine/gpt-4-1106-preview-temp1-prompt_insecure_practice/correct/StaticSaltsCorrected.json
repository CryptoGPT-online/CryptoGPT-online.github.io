### False Positive Misuse ###

Upon reviewing the misuse reports related to cryptographic API usage, there is misinformation regarding the salt size that should be addressed:

1. The first misuse report mentions, "Inadequate Salt Size," stating 64 bits (8 bytes) as generally recommended but advising 128 bits (16 bytes) for better security. This is a false positive, as the code correctly uses a 32-byte (256 bits) salt, which exceeds the recommended size. This statement conflicts with the second misuse report within the same list that acknowledges the use of a 32-byte size but still inaccurately labels it "Weak Salt Generation."

2. The same "Weak Salt Generation" statement appears again in the second misuse list, which is still incorrect given that the salt is, indeed, the recommended 32 bytes and generated using `SecureRandom`, which is considered cryptographically strong.

3. "Insecure Salt Generation" from the third misuse list is also a false positive. It criticizes salt persistence, which is not part of the code's responsibility in the reviewed scope. The code snippet does not indicate whether the salt is stored or not; it merely generates it.

4. The last list is empty, automatically suggesting no misuses, which doesn't need modification.

The remaining misuse reports correctly identify an insufficient iteration count of "1020" for the PBEParameterSpec, which should be increased to at least "10000" iterations to conform to current security standards.
