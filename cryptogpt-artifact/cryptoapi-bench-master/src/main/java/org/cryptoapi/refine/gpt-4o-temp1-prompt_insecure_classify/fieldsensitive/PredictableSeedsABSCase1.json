### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Misuse: "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength"  
   - Description: The report highlights that the hardcoded seed is short and impacts randomness, indicating inadequate encryption strength. However, setting the seed in SecureRandom does not directly relate to encryption strength but concerns the strength of randomness.
   - Reason: This issue deals with randomness predictability rather than encryption strength in the context of this code, which does not employ encryption algorithms directly. Thus, the identified CWE-326 doesn't apply correctly here.
