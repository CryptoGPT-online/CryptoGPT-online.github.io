```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "E1.<init>",
    "vulnerable_code": "`KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");`",
    "description": "Using default key size for AES is not secure. According to NIST recommendations, a minimum of 128-bit key should be used.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly during key generation. For example, `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", 256);`. Using stronger key size like 256-bit is recommended."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_method": "E1.<init>",
    "vulnerable_code": "`String cryptoAlgo = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";`",
    "description": "Using ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode for block encryption is insecure as it does not provide data confidentiality.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure block cipher mode like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter) mode. For example, `String cryptoAlgo = \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\";`."
