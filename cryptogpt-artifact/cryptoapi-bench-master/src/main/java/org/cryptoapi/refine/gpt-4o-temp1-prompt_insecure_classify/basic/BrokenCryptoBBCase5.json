### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. The use of the IDEA algorithm in the provided code is consistently identified as a risk due to its obsolescence and potential vulnerabilities compared to newer algorithms like AES. All reports correctly identify the same underlying issue of using a risky cryptographic algorithm.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"IDEA\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\");",
        "description": "The IDEA encryption algorithm is considered to be obsolete and not recommended for secure applications. It's less secure compared to more modern algorithms.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Modify the code to use AES instead of IDEA."
