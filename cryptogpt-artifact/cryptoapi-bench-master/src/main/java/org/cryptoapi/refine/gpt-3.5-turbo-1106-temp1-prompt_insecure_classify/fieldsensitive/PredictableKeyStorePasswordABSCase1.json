  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "defKey = key;",
    "description": "The default key in C1 class is set to a hardcoded value 'changeit'",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure and dynamic way to obtain the key. Consider using a configuration file or an external source to store the key securely."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), passedKey.toCharArray());",
    "description": "The `load` method of `KeyStore` is used to load the keystore from the specified input stream. In this code, the keystore is loaded using a password passed as a `char` array. This is a potential misuse because using a `char` array to represent a password can lead to security vulnerabilities. `char` arrays can be explicitly zeroed out from memory after use, while `String` objects cannot. Therefore, using a `String` object to represent a password is more secure.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of passing the password as a `char` array, use a `String` object to represent the password. Use a strong encryption algorithm and a secure key generation process to load the KeyStore. Consider using asymmetrical encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "description": "The code is loading a certificate from the hardcoded URL 'https://www.google.com'. This can result in improper certificate validation as the trustworthiness of the certificate is not guaranteed.",
    "recommendation": "Use a trusted and validated source for obtaining certificates. Implement certificate pinning to ensure secure and proper certificate validation."
