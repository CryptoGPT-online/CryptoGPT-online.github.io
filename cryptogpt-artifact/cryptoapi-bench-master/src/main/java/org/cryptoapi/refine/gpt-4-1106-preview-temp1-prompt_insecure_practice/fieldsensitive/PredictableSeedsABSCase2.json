### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts" - The code provided does not show any authentication mechanism, so this misuse is not applicable.
2. "Insufficient Exception Handling" - Throwing exceptions from a constructor is not inherently insecure. It is a common practice to signal the failure of object creation due to invalid parameters or environmental issues.
3. "Static Initialization Vector (IV)" - The code does not show any use of an IV, so this misuse is not applicable.
4. "Use of a Non-standard Algorithm" - The misuse is not applicable as SecureRandom does not necessarily use a non-standard algorithm when seeded; it uses the seed to produce a predictable sequence of numbers, which is a different issue.
5. "Unused Parameter" - The parameter 'passedSeed' is indeed used, although it is immediately overwritten, which is a code quality issue rather than a security issue.
6. "Weak Cryptographic Algorithm Configuration" - The code snippet does not show any cryptographic algorithm configuration, so this misuse is not applicable.
