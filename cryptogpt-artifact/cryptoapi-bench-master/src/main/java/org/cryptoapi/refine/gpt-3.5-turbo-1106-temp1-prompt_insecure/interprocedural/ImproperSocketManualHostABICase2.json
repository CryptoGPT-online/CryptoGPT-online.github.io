{
  "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(hostName.toString(),soc);",
  "description": "The code uses the defaultSocketFactory, which can lead to insecure SSL/TLS configurations. Additionally, the use of hostName.toString() to obtain the host name from a char array may not provide the intended hostname string.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure custom SSLSocketFactory that enforces secure protocols and cipher suites, and use a dedicated method to convert the char array to a String to ensure the correct hostname is used."
