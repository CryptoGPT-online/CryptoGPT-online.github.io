## False Positive Misuse
"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" is a false positive in this context. The IV (Initialization Vector) value, which is a component of CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) encryption, isn't directly derived from user input. Instead, the IV is typically randomly generated using a cryptographic strong random number generator.

In this case, the IV is created from a user-provided byte array (bytes), but this byte array isn't randomly generated and therefore isn't an instance of a "use of insufficiently random values" issue. Rather, the IV is derived from a deterministic input, which is a common practice in encryption scenarios.
