### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.
   **Vulnerable Code:** `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");`
   **Description:** The misuse report claims that the code uses a default key size of 128 bits for AES, which is considered inadequate.
   **Explanation:** However, the code does not explicitly set the key size, and the default key size for AES will vary depending on the Java implementation. In modern Java versions, the default key size for AES is 256 bits, which is considered adequate for most purposes.
