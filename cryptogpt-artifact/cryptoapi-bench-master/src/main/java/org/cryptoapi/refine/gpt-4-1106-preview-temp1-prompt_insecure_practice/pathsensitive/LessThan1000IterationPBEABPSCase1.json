### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Insecure Initialization Vector**: This is a false positive because the code is not using an initialization vector (IV) for encryption. Instead, it is generating a salt for password-based encryption (PBE), which is a different concept. The salt is being generated securely using `SecureRandom`.

2. **Insecure Randomness**: This is a false positive because `SecureRandom` is a secure random number generator that is suitable for cryptographic operations. It does not require explicit seeding as it automatically provides sufficient entropy on most platforms.

3. **Static Salt**: This is a false positive because the code shows that a new salt is generated each time the program is run. The salt is not static; it is generated using `SecureRandom`.

4. **Use of a Predictable Salt**: This is a false positive because `SecureRandom` is designed to produce a non-predictable output suitable for cryptographic use, even without specifying an RNG algorithm. The default implementation of `SecureRandom` is considered secure for generating a salt.
