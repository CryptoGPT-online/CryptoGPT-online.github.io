### False Positive Misuse
```json
[{
    "misuse_category": "Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "B9.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The provided code is using the SHA1 hash algorithm, which has been proven to be insecure. The SHA1 algorithm is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes and it's not recommended to use it for data integrity or security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic hash function instead of SHA1. Some secure alternatives include SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512. If the application requires SHA1 for backward compatibility, you should consider including this limitation and how it may affect your application's overall security."
