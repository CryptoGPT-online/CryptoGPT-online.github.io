### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse related to the "Improper Conversion of Salt to Byte Array" and similar entries in other lists are not entirely false positives, but they are incorrectly described. The actual issue is that `salt.toString()` will not return the content of the `char[]` array but rather its object reference, which is not the intended salt value. The conversion to a byte array is not even properly attempted, so the misuse is not just improper conversion but a fundamental misunderstanding of how to handle character arrays in Java.

2. The misuse related to "Static Initialization of Salt" is a false positive in the sense that static initialization itself is not inherently insecure. However, the reuse of a hardcoded salt is insecure, so the misuse should focus on the hardcoded and predictable nature of the salt rather than the static initialization.
