### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Unspecified Cipher Mode and Padding" - This is a false positive because the code does specify the cipher mode and padding when `choice` is greater than 1. However, it is true that when `choice` is not greater than 1, the default mode and padding are used, which is insecure.

2. "Hardcoded Encryption Key" - This is a false positive because the key is generated at runtime using `KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")`, and there is no evidence in the provided code that the key is hardcoded.

3. "Inadequate Exception Handling" - This is a false positive because the method `go` is declared to throw the relevant exceptions, and it is the responsibility of the calling method to handle them. The provided code does not show how exceptions are handled in the `main` method or elsewhere.

4. "Insecure Randomness" - This is a false positive because `KeyGenerator` uses a secure random source by default for key generation, and there is no evidence in the provided code that an insecure source is used.

5. "Error Propagation" - This is a false positive because the method `go` is designed to propagate exceptions to the caller, which is a common practice. The caller should handle the exceptions appropriately.
