### False Positive Misuse
- The misuse category "Insecure Random Seed" in the first reported misuse list might be a false positive because the provided seed is a string and converting this string to a byte array may not necessarily lead to insecure randomness.
- The misuse category "Unbounded Loop in go2 method" and "Unbounded Loop in go3 method" in the second reported misuse list are also false positives because they are not true security issues. The seed is converted to a byte array which does not exceed the maximum length of the seed used by the SecureRandom class, so there is no need to check it.
- The misuse category "Insecure Random Number Generation" in the third reported misuse list might be a false positive as the use of a single byte as a seed in the SecureRandom constructor is not necessarily insecure, but it's better to avoid such a seed for security reasons.
- The misuse category "CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials" in the fourth reported misuse list might also be a false positive as the provided seed is hardcoded and not changed over time.
