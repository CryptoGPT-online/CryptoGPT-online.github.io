 Here is the JSON response for the optimized misuse list:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\")",
    "description": "The method 'go' is using the 'IDEA' algorithm, which is a broken and risky algorithm. It should be replaced with a more secure algorithm like 'AES'.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\")' with 'Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")'."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "keyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "description": "The method 'go' is using the 'AES' algorithm with a key length of 128 bits, which may not be sufficient for all use cases. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits for most applications.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to 256 bits or higher to ensure adequate encryption strength."
