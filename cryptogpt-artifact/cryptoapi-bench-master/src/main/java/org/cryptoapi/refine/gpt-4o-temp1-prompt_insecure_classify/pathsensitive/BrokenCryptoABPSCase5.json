### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives because the use of the IDEA algorithm in the code is indeed a risky and outdated cryptographic practice. The recommendations provided suggest using more secure algorithms, such as AES, which are applicable and relevant. The checks and recommendations align with the potential security concerns of using IDEA.
