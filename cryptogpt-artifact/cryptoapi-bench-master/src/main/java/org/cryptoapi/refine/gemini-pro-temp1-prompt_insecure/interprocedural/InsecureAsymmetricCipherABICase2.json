### False Positive Misuse ###
There is one false positive misuse in the given lists:
- "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm": The code uses the RSA algorithm, which is not inherently broken or risky. While it is true that RSA can be vulnerable to certain attacks, such as the Bleichenbacher attack, when used for specific purposes (such as encrypting session cookies), it is still considered a secure algorithm for general encryption purposes.
