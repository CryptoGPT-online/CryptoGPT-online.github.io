False Positive Misuses:

* CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
	+ The iteration count used in the PBE parameter specification is low, which can lead to weak encryption and vulnerability to brute force attacks.
	+ Recommendation: Use a higher iteration count, such as 10000 or more, to ensure adequate encryption strength.
	+ False positive: The iteration count is set to 1020, which is a relatively low value but still sufficient for most use cases.
* CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
	+ The salt used in the PBE parameter specification is not randomly generated, which can lead to vulnerabilities in the encryption process.
	+ Recommendation: Use a securely generated salt, such as the `SecureRandom` class in Java, to ensure that the salt is unpredictable.
	+ False positive: The salt is randomly generated using the `SecureRandom` class, which ensures that the salt is unpredictable.
