### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Potential Insecure Random Number Generator" - The code does not show the use of a random number generator for key generation, and the default behavior of `KeyGenerator` is to use a secure random source. Without evidence of misuse, this is a false positive.

2. "Using a Weak Random Number Generator for Key Generation" - Similar to the above, the default behavior of `KeyGenerator` is to use a secure random source, and the code does not show any custom RNG being used. This is a false positive.

3. "Static Decision for Encryption Mode" - The decision to use a particular encryption mode based on the `choice` variable is not inherently insecure. The security concern would be if the `choice` variable could be influenced by an attacker, but there is no indication of this in the provided code. This is a false positive.
