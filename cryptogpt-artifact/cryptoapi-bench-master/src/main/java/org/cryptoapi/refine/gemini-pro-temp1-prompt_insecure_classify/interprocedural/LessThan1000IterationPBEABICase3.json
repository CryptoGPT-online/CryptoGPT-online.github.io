### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "L3.method1()",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code generates a salt of a fixed size (32 bytes) using `SecureRandom.nextBytes()`. Generating salts of a fixed size is not considered secure, as it makes it easier for an attacker to guess the salt.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate salts of a variable size, typically between 16 and 32 bytes. Consider using a salt derivation function, such as PBKDF2, to strengthen the salt."
