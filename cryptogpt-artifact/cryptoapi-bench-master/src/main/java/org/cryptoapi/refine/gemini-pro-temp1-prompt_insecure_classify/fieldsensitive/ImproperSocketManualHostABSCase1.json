### False Positive Misuse ###

None in this case.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();\nSSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(passedHostname,passedSoc);",
    "description": "The code is using the default SSLSocketFactory to create an SSLSocket. This may result in using weak encryption algorithms that are vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure SSLSocketFactory that uses strong encryption algorithms, such as TLSv1.2 or later and AES-256."
