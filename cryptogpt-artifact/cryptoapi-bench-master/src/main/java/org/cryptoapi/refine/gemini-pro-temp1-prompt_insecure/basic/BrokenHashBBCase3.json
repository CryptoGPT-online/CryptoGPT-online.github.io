    "description": "The MD4 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
