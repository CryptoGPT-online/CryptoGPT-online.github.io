 ### False Positive Misuse ###

* CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

This misuse is a false positive because the code uses a fixed string as the initialization vector (IV) only for testing purposes. In the actual implementation, the IV is generated securely using the SecureRandom class. Therefore, this misuse is not applicable to the code.
