### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Predictable SecureRandom Output (CWE-338)**: The misuse regarding "Predictable SecureRandom Output" which claims issues with converting SecureRandom integers directly to strings, overlaps with observations noted under the other misuses about insecure random password generation. The root issue has already been captured there as SecureRandom could be more predictably used if not processed correctly. Therefore, we can consider this specific nomenclature a false positive because the issue is essentially a subset of insecure password generation.
