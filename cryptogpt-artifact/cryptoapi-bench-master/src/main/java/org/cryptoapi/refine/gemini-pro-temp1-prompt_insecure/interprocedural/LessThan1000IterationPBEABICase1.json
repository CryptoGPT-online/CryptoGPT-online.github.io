### False Positive Misuse ###
- **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Password** from the 3rd list is a false positive.
The salt is generated using a pseudo-random number generator, not a hard-coded value.

- **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage in a File or Database** from the 3rd list is a false positive.
The password is not stored in plaintext in the PBEParameterSpec object. It is used to derive the encryption key.
