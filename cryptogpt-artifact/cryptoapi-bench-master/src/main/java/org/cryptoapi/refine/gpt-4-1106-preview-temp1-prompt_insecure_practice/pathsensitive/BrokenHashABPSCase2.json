### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse related to "Broken Crypto Algorithm" for `MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")` is a false positive in this context because the code is conditionally using MD5 or SHA-256 based on the value of `choice`. If `choice` is greater than 1, which it is in the provided code, the program uses SHA-256, which is a secure hash function. Therefore, the actual execution of the code does not use MD5 for hashing.
