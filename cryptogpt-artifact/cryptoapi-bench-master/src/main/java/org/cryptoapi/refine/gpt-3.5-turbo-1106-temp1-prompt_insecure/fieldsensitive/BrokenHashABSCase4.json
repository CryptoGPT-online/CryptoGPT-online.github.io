        "description": "The way the cryptographic algorithm is retrieved from the class field 'crypto' may lead to insecure use of cryptographic API.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to carefully validate the algorithm name and reject any unknown or deprecated algorithms. Also, the algorithm should be passed as a parameter and not retrieved from a class field."
