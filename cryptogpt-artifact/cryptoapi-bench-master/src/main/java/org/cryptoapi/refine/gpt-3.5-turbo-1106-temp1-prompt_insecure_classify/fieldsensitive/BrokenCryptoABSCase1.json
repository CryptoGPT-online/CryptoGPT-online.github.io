    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C2(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The DES algorithm used in ECB mode with PKCS5Padding is considered to be a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.",

    "description": "Generating a key without specifying the key length or using a weak algorithm can result in inadequate encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a key length and use a strong cryptographic algorithm like AES or RSA."

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses a default initialization mode (ECB) for encryption, which is not secure and can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure initialization mode like CBC or GCM."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C2(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses DES as the default algorithm for encryption. DES is considered a broken and risky algorithm because of its small key size and vulnerability to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace DES with a more secure algorithm like AES."
