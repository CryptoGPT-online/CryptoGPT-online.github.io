### False Positive Misuse ###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "passedURL = defURL;",
    "description": "In the provided code, the URL `defURL` is not random, and it is reused in the `method1` function without any manipulation. This is a problem because if the same URL is used multiple times, it exposes your code to the risk of detecting that the same URL is being used (e.g., for replay attacks).",
    "recommendation": "Consider making `defURL` random, or ensuring that it is changing each time the method is called."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.", 
    "vulnerable_code": "defURL",
    "description": "The defURL field in the C1 class is hardcoded with a string representing a URL. This could potentially be a problem if the URL changes or if it's sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding sensitive data. Use environment variables or configuration files to store URLs and other sensitive data."
