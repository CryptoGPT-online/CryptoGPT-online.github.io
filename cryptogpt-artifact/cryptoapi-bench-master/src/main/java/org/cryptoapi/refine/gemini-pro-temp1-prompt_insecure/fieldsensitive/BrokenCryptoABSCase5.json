### False Positive Misuse ###

**Misuse 1**
```json
{
  "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
  "description": "The key generation algorithm is not specified and defaults to the default algorithm for the given provider. This could result in insufficient entropy in the generated key, making it easier for an attacker to guess or brute-force the key.",
  "recommendation": "Specify a secure key generation algorithm, such as 'AES' or 'RSA', and ensure that it is initialized with a cryptographically secure random number generator."
}
```
**Explanation:**
This misuse is a false positive because the code generates a key using `KeyGenerator`, which is a secure way to generate keys. The key size is not specified in the code, but it is assumed to be sufficient for the intended purpose.

**Misuse 2**
```json
{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Key-Generation Algorithm with Insufficient Entropy",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
  "description": "The key generation algorithm is not specified and defaults to the default algorithm for the given provider. This could result in insufficient entropy in the generated key, making it easier for an attacker to guess or brute-force the key.",
  "recommendation": "Specify a secure key generation algorithm, such as 'AES' or 'RSA', and ensure that it is initialized with a cryptographically secure random number generator."
}
```
**Explanation:**
This misuse is also a false positive because the code generates a key using `KeyGenerator`, which is a secure way to generate keys. The key size is not specified in the code, but it is assumed to be sufficient for the intended purpose.
