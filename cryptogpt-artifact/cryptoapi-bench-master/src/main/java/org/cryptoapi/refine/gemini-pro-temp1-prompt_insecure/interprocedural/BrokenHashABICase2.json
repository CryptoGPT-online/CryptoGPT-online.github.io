```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code is using MD5, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This makes it unsuitable for use in applications where data integrity is important.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
