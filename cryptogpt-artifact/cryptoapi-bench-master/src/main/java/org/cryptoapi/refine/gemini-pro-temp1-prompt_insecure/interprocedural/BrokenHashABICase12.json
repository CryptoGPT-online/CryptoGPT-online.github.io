    "description": "The code uses the MD2 algorithm for hashing, which is a known weak algorithm and is no longer considered secure. MD2 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of MD2."
