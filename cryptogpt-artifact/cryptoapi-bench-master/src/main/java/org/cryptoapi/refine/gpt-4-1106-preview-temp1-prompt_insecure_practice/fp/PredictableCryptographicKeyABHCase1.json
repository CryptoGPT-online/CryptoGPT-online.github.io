### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)" - This misuse is a false positive because the `Arrays.copyOf` method is being used correctly to ensure that the key is of the correct size. There is no evidence of buffer overflow or underflow in the provided code snippet.

2. "Static Initialization Vector (IV)" - This misuse is a false positive because the code snippet provided does not show the use of an Initialization Vector (IV) at all. The misuse is speculative and not based on the actual code.
