[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C3(\"Blowfish\");",
        "description": "The Blowfish algorithm is considered outdated and not recommended for use in secure applications. It can be vulnerable to security breaches due to its small block size of 64 bits, which leads to issues like birthday attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which is currently recommended for secure data encryption."

        "misuse": "Predictable Key Generation",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo); SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
        "description": "Using algorithms with KeyGenerator might result in predictable keys if not properly initialized with secure random numbers. This can lead to insecure encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the KeyGenerator is initialized with a secure random number generator. For example, use KeyGenerator#init(int keysize, SecureRandom random) with an adequately secure random instance."
