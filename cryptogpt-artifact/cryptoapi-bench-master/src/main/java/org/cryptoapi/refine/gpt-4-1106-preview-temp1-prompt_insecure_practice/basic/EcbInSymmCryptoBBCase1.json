### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The "Static Key" misuse is a false positive. The code is using `KeyGenerator` to generate a new AES key each time the `go()` method is called, which means the key is not static. The key is dynamically generated and not hardcoded, which is a good practice.

2. The "Missing SecureRandom Initialization" misuse is a false positive. While it is true that explicitly providing a `SecureRandom` instance can increase the entropy, the `KeyGenerator` by default uses a secure random source for key generation. Therefore, unless there is a specific requirement for a custom source of randomness, this is not a misuse.

3. The "Missing IV for CBC mode" misuse is a false positive because the code is not using CBC mode; it is using ECB mode. While ECB mode is insecure, the misuse is incorrectly identifying the lack of an IV for CBC mode, which is not applicable here.

4. The "Lack of Secure Random IV" misuse is a false positive for the same reason as above; the code is not using a mode that requires an IV, so this misuse is not relevant to the provided code.
