        "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
        "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm, which is a widely used and standardized encryption algorithm, but it is not specified whether it is the AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 variant, which can be a problem because the security of the encryption depends on the key length. The code also does not specify the mode of operation, which can also affect the security of the encryption.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to specify the key length and the mode of operation when using the AES algorithm to ensure the security of the encryption. It is also recommended to use a securely generated key, rather than a hardcoded key, to protect the confidentiality of the data."
