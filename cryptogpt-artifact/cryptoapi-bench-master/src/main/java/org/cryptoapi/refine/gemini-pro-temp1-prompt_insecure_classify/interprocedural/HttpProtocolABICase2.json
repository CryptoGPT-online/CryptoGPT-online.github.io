### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "H2.DEFAULT_URL",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_URL = \"http://www.google.com\"",
    "description": "The code contains a hardcoded URL, which is a security risk. Hardcoded credentials, such as passwords, API keys, or in this case, a URL, are stored directly in the code. If an attacker gains access to the code, they can easily extract the hardcoded credentials and use them to compromise the system.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding credentials in the code. Instead, store them securely in a configuration file or environment variable. This makes it more difficult for attackers to access and misuse them."
