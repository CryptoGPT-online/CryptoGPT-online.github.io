    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not properly initialized with a seed. As a result, the random values generated may not be cryptographically strong, which can lead to weakened security for cryptographic operations such as key generation or encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Initialize the SecureRandom instance using a strong source of entropy, such as by using SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() or by providing a seed from a secure random source."

    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is being used to generate random bytes for the salt, but the length of the salt is set to 32 bytes, which may not be sufficiently random for the specific cryptographic operation.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator and consider using a longer salt for increased security."

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);\nint count = 20;",
    "description": "The code uses a constant iteration count of 20, which is considered insufficient for modern security requirements. Additionally, the salt generation process using SecureRandom may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure and dynamic iteration count for key derivation, and consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator like SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() for salt generation."
