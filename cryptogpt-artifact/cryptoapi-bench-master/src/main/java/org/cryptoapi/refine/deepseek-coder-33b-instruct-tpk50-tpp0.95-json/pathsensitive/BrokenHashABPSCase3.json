    "description": "The choice of cryptographic algorithm is dependent on a user-provided value, which can potentially lead to the selection of a weak or broken algorithm.",

    "vulnerable_code": "md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
    "description": "The code uses the SHA-256 algorithm which is considered to be quite secure, but SHA-256 has been broken in 2016, meaning that attacks against it are now possible. This does not mean that the algorithm is immediately insecure, but it should be avoided for any new applications.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using stronger algorithms like SHA-3 or BLAKE2 for cryptographic operations. These algorithms are more resistant to attacks and are widely recognized for their security."

    "description": "MD4 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. MD4 is considered a weak hash function and there are potential collision attacks. Therefore, the MD4 algorithm is not recommended for any real-world security use.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use stronger cryptographic algorithms. Instead of using MD4, you can use SHA-256 or any other modern hash functions."
