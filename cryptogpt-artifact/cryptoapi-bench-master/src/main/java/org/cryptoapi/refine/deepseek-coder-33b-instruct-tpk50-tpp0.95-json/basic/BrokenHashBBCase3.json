False Positive Misuse:

"Using Broken Crypto Algorithm (MD4)"

The reported misuse is incorrect. In the code provided, the cryptographic hash algorithm used is MD4. However, the recommendation to use SHA-256, SHA-3 or BLAKE2 is incorrect because the algorithm used here is MD4. The correct recommendation would be to use another algorithm as MD4 is not a secure algorithm anymore.

False Positive Misuse:

"Using Broken Cryptographic Algorithms (MD4)"

The report again incorrectly points to use of MD4 and recommends SHA-256 instead of MD4. However, the code actually uses MD4, hence this misuse report is incorrect.
