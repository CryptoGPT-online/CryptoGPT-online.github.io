        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count and key length to improve the security of the encryption. It's also recommended to use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256, instead of the current hash function."

        "description": "The code uses the outdated and insecure password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm to derive a key from a password. The PBE algorithm was designed to be used with a slow hashing function, but in this case, it is not being used with a slow hashing function. This makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
