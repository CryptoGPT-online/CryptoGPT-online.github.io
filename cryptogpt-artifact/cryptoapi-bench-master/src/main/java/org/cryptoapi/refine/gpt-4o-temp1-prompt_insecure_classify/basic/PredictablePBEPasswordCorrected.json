### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**
   - **Reason**: The code uses `SecureRandom`, which is a cryptographically strong random number generator. Although it converts random integers directly into a string, which could be improved, the primary concern here is not the randomness but rather the method of conversion. This does not closely align with the typical concerns associated with CWE-330, as the underlying random source is secure. Therefore, the real issue lies more in the representation or handling post-generation, and could be considered a false positive for CWE-330 based on the context here.

        "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
        "description": "The key length of 16 bits is too low for adequate encryption strength, which makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a longer key length, such as 128, 192, or 256 bits, to ensure stronger encryption strength."
