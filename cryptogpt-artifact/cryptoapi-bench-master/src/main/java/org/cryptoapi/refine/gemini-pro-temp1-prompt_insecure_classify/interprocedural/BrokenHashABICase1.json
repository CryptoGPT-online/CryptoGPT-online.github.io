[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String)",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "SHA-1 is a deprecated algorithm and is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be used to create digital signatures that are difficult to verify.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
