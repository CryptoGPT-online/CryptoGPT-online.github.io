### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Missing SecureRandom for Key Generation" and "Insecure Randomness" are false positives because the `KeyGenerator` class is designed to use a secure random source by default. While it is good practice to explicitly specify a `SecureRandom` instance, the absence of it does not necessarily indicate a misuse.

2. "Insufficient Key Size" and "Key Length Not Specified" are false positives in the context that the default key size (128 bits) for AES is considered secure for most applications. However, specifying a larger key size (e.g., 256 bits) is a good practice for higher security requirements.

3. "Inadequate Exception Handling" and "No Exception Handling" are false positives in this context because the main method is a simple test harness, and the exceptions are propagated to the top level for simplicity. In a production environment, proper exception handling would be necessary.

4. "Insufficient Key Management" is a false positive in this context because the code snippet is a simple example and does not reflect a complete application where key management would be a concern.
