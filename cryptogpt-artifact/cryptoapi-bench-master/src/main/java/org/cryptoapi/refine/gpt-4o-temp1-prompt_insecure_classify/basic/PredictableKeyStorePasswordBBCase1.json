        "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\"); ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());",
        "description": "The code loads a keystore from a remote URL without proper validation. There's a risk of man-in-the-middle attacks or loading a malicious or tampered keystore.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that any keystore loaded from a remote source is verified for authenticity. Consider using a local keystore file and ensuring its integrity, or apply verification mechanisms like certificate pinning."

        "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
        "description": "The code uses a hardcoded password ('changeit') for the keystore. This makes the application vulnerable to unauthorized access if the password becomes known.",
