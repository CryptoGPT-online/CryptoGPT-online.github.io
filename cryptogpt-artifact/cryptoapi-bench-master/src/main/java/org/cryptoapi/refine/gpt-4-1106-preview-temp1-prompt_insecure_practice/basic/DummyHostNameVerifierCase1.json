### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. All the reported misuses correctly identify the security issue with the custom `HostnameVerifier` implementation that always returns `true`.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Hostname Verification (CWE-297)",
        "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) { return true; }",
        "description": "The custom HostnameVerifier implementation bypasses all hostname verification checks by always returning true, which can lead to Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks by accepting any SSL/TLS certificate without validating the hostname.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname validation according to the HTTPS specification, or use the default HostnameVerifier provided by the library."
