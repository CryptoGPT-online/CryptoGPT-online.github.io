### False Positives ###
There is no false positive misuse. The misuse lists are accurate and present a risk for potential misuse.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse category": "Weak or Broken Cryptographic Algorithm Used",
        "vulnerable_method": "B6.go(String)",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The code is using a cryptographic algorithm that is considered weak (MD5) or broken. An attacker can generate MD5 hash collisions, and can find pre-images for MD5.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256. Also, it is important to make sure that the value of crypto is not controlled by user or an external source."
