### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Potential Weakness in Default Encryption**

   **Explanation**: The code misuse report regarding the `System.out.println(md.digest())` as a weakness in printing the digest directly can be mitigated since, in the context provided, we are only dealing with a hardcoded string (`"abcdef"`) and an example usage of `SHA-256` when `choice > 1`. Although not generally secure for production code, this particular use in the sample code does not have direct risk associated since `name` is not sensitive data for this illustration.
