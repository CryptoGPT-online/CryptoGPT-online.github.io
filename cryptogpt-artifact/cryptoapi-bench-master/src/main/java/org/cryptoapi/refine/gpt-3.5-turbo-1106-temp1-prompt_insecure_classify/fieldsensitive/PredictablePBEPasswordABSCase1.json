    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(passedPassword.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code is using PBKDF1 algorithm for key derivation, which is considered to be weak and insecure. PBKDF2 or bcrypt should be used instead.",
    "recommendation": "Replace PBKDF1 with PBKDF2 or bcrypt."

    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length used for deriving the key is too short, which reduces the encryption strength. A key length of at least 128 bits is recommended for modern cryptographic algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 128 bits."

    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = new byte[16];",
    "description": "The code uses a constant byte array as a salt for the cryptographic operation, which is not sufficiently random.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a random salt for each cryptographic operation."

    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is used to generate a salt value for cryptographic operations. However, the SecureRandom instance is not properly seeded with random values, which may result in a predictable or weak salt value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator like java.security.SecureRandom for generating salts. Additionally, ensure that the SecureRandom instance is properly seeded with unpredictable values for better randomness."
