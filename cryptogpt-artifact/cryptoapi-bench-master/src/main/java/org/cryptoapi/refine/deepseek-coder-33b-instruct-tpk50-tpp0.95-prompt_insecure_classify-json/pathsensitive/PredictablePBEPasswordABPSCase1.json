### False Positive Misuse:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The salt value is generated using a non-cryptographic pseudo-random number generator (java.util.Random). This can lead to predictable salts, making the password hash more susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of java.util.Random, SecureRandom should be used. This provides a cryptographically strong random number generator."
