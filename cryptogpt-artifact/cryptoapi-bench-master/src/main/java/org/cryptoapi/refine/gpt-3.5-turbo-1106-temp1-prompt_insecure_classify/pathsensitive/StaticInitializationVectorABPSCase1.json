    "description": "The SecureRandom object is used to generate random bytes for the initialization vector (IV). However, in the if statement, when choice > 1, it generates a new byte array but does not re-initialize the SecureRandom object. This may result in using a less random IV. Re-initialize the SecureRandom object before generating a new random byte array for the IV.",
