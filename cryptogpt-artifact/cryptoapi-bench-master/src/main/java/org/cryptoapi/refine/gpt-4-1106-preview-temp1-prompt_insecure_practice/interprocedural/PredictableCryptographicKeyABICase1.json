### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Inadequate Key Size" and "Insufficient Key Size" are reported as misuses due to the key being fixed to 16 bytes (128 bits). However, AES-128 is a valid and secure choice for many applications. Unless the specific security requirements dictate a larger key size, using a 128-bit key is not a misuse. Therefore, these can be considered false positives if AES-128 meets the security requirements.

2. "Improper Key Zeroing" is mentioned as a misuse because the original byte array is not zeroed out. However, this is not a direct misuse of a cryptographic API but rather a best practice for handling sensitive data. It is a security recommendation but not necessarily a cryptographic API misuse.

3. "Use of ECB Mode" is listed as a misuse, but the provided code does not specify any mode of operation. Since the mode of operation is not set in the code snippet, we cannot confirm the use of ECB mode. This is a false positive unless additional code confirms the use of ECB.
