"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
"description": "The use of a static password salt in a PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm is vulnerable to attack as it allows an attacker to easily guess the password by simply iterating through the possible passwords and re-encrypting them with the known salt.",
"recommendation": "Use a randomly generated salt each time a password is encrypted, and store it securely."
}

Note: The misuse CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength is not applicable in this case as the actual iteration count is 1024, which is a higher value and sufficient to ensure encryption strength.

Note: The misuse CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values is not applicable in this case as the salt is generated using a secure random number generator, which is secure and random enough.
