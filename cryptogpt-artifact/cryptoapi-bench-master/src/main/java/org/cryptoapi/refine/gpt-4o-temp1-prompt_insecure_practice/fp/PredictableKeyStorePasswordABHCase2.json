### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: Use of Constant URL without Certificate Verification**
   - **Reason:** The URL "https://www.google.com" is unlikely being used for a real KeyStore in production code. It's often a placeholder or example URL. The misuse should focus on the fact that a real, trusted URL is not being used rather than emphasizing the certificate verification given that in production code, HTTPS would typically be used with an appropriately configured trust mechanism.

2. **Misuse: Loading Remote Keystore over HTTP**
   - **Reason:** This raises an issue about loading over HTTP; however, the code uses HTTPS, which inherently provides a secure transport mechanism. The crux of the problem is more about using a non-trusted source or the actual utility of "https://www.google.com" as a KeyStore source.
