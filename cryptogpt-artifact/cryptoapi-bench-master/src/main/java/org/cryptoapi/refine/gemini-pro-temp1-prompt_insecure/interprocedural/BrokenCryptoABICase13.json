### False Positive Misuse

The only potential false positive in the provided lists is:

**CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
**Vulnerable Code:** ```java
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
```
**Description:** The misuse report claims that the code uses an insecure key size for encryption. However, the provided code does not specify a key size, so this misuse is not applicable (false positive).
