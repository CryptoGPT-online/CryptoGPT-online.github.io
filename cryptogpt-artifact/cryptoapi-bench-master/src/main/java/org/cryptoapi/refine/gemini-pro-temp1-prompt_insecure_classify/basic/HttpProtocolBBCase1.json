I understand that the code you provided does not seem to use any cryptographic APIs. However, it is important to note that the presence of cryptographic APIs in code does not necessarily mean that there are misuses. Misuses can occur when cryptographic APIs are used incorrectly, even if the APIs themselves are secure.

In this case, the code you provided does not use any cryptographic APIs, so there are no misuses to report. However, if you have any other code that you would like me to review, I would be happy to do so.

Here are some general tips for avoiding cryptographic API misuses:

* Use strong and secure cryptographic algorithms.
* Use key lengths that are appropriate for the level of security required.
* Generate random values securely.
* Store cryptographic keys and other sensitive information securely.
* Validate certificates properly.
* Keep up to date with the latest security advisories and patches.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your applications from cryptographic API misuses.
