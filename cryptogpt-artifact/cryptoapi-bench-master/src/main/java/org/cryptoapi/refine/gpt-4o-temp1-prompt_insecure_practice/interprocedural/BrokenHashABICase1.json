### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. The cryptographic API misuse identified refers to the use of SHA-1, which is widely acknowledged as insecure due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. Therefore, all entries correctly point out a legitimate security concern.
