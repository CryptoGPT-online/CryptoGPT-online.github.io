 ### False Positive Misuse JSON

{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The use of a fixed and predictable seed value for the SecureRandom algorithm makes it easier for an attacker to predict the output.",
"recommendation": "Use a truly random seed value, such as from /dev/random or a hardware random number generator."

### Optimized Misuse JSON

{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
"description": "The use of `SecureRandom` with a known and predictable seed value is a security vulnerability. The seed value is not random and can be easily predicted, which can lead to a predictable random number generation. This can be exploited by an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator and potentially compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of `SecureRandom` with a cryptographically secure random number generation algorithm, such as `Random` or `CryptoRandom`. Use a cryptographically secure seed value, such as a value generated by a cryptographically secure random number generation algorithm or a value derived from a secure randomness source."

{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The use of a fixed array of bytes as a seed for a SecureRandom instance is not secure. It allows an attacker to predict the random values generated by the SecureRandom instance.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), to generate a random seed. Also, consider using a sufficient seed length, at least 128 bits, to make it harder for an attacker to predict the random values."
