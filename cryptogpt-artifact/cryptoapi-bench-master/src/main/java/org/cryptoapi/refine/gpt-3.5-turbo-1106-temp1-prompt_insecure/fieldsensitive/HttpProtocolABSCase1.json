```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C1(url);",
    "description": "The code is creating a C1 instance for cryptographic operations without specifying any cryptographic algorithm or mechanism. This may lead to the use of insecure or broken cryptographic algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a well-established and secure cryptographic algorithm when creating the C1 instance."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-320: Key Management Errors",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C1(url);",
    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded URL 'http://gmail.com' to create an instance of C1, which could lead to insecure default settings in cryptographic algorithms or key management.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hard-coding sensitive information such as URLs, and use a secure key management strategy for cryptographic operations."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "if(passedURL.isEmpty()){ passedURL = defURL; }",
    "description": "The code only checks if the passedURL is empty, which can still be exploited with other invalid or malicious input.",
    "recommendation": "Perform more comprehensive input validation, such as whitelisting, to ensure that the URL is well-formed and not pointing to potentially malicious sites."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(passedURL));",
    "description": "The code is creating a new URL object without proper certificate validation, potentially leaving the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure implementation of URL validation and consider using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks."
