  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-297: Improper Generation of Cryptographic Keys or Parameters",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and no longer secure. Attackers can find collisions and preimages for MD4, making it unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."

    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "The MD4 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collisions, which means that different inputs can produce the same output.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."

    "misuse category": "Weak Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\");",
    "description": "MD4 is a weak cryptographic algorithm and is not recommended for use. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and should not be used for any security-sensitive applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
