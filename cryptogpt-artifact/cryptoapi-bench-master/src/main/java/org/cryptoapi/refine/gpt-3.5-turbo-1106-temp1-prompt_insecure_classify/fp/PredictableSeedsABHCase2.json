    "description": "The seed for the SecureRandom object is generated from two bytes, which is not sufficient for generating strong random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger source of entropy for generating the seed, such as using SecureRandom.generateSeed() or reading from /dev/urandom."
