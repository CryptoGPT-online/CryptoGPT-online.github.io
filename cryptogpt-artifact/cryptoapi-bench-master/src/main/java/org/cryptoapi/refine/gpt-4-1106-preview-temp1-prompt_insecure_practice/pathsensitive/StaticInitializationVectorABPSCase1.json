### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Weak Key Generation" is reported as a misuse due to the default key size not being specified. However, this is not necessarily a security issue because the default key size for AES in Java is 128 bits, which is considered secure for most applications. Therefore, unless the security requirements specify a larger key size, this is not a misuse.

2. "Insecure Randomness" and "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)" are reported as misuses due to concerns about the seeding of `SecureRandom`. However, `SecureRandom` is designed to be secure and self-seeding from a high-entropy source. Explicit seeding is generally not required unless there is a specific reason to distrust the platform's entropy sources.

3. "ECB Mode Usage" is reported as a misuse, but the code is actually using "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding", which is not ECB mode. This is a false positive.

4. "CWE-326: Insecure Cipher Mode" is reported due to the use of CBC mode, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. However, this is context-dependent, and CBC mode can be secure if implemented correctly with a random IV and proper error handling. Therefore, this is not necessarily a misuse without additional context.

5. "No Secure Random Seed" is reported as a misuse, but as mentioned earlier, `SecureRandom` does not typically require manual seeding.
