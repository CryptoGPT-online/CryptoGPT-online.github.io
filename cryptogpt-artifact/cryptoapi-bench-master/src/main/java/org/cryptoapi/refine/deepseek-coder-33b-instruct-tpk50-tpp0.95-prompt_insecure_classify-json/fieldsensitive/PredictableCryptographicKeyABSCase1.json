### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse category "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm." is false positive. The provided code uses AES with CBC mode, but it's within Java's default cipher suite, which is considered secure. Also, the encryption key is not generated using a insecure random number generator. So, this is a false positive.
