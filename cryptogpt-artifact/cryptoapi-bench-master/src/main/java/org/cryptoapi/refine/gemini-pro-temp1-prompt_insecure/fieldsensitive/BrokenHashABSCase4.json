### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
 - Vulnerable code: `crypto = new C4("MD2")`
 - Explanation: The reported misuse is not applicable in this context. While MD2 is a weak hashing algorithm, the vulnerable code does not use MD2 for encryption but rather for hashing. MD2 is still considered acceptable for use in certain non-cryptographic applications, such as generating checksums.
