### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength** reported for not specifying the key size is a false positive. The IDEA algorithm uses a fixed key size of 128 bits, which cannot be changed. Specifying a key size for algorithms with fixed key sizes is not necessary.
2. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** reported for the `KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);` with concerns about RNG is a false positive because the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) ensures that a cryptographically strong random number generator is used during key generation unless specified otherwise. There is no misuse in this instance because the `KeyGenerator` class creates a secure random number generator by default.
3. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials** is a false positive because the code does not hardcode cryptographic settings; it uses an empty string as a parameter to allow selection of the default algorithm. This does not constitute hardcoded credentials or settings.
