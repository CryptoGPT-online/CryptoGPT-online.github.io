### False Positive Misuse ###

In this specific code snippet, there is a condition that switches from "SHA-1" to "SHA-256" when the `choice` variable is greater than 1. While this condition indicates a code path leading to "SHA-256", the presence of SHA-1 is still a valid concern because of its initial usage before the condition. Hence, despite the conditional switch to "SHA-256", this cannot be considered a false positive because the code indeed initially sets up a "SHA-1" instance. Every entry in the misuse list correctly identifies the use of SHA-1 as a problem, and none can be considered a false positive in this context.
