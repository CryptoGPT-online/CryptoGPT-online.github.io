### False Positive Misuse ###
- The misuse reported is not a false positive. The code sets a seed, even if it's not a fixed number, it may still lead to predictable randomness if the seed is not derived from a strong source of randomness. This can result in predictable output from SecureRandom, which is aligned with the misuse report of CWE-330. Therefore, no misuse report is identified as false positive.
