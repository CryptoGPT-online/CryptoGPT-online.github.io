Given the misuse lists and the provided code, there are no misuses that should be considered false positives.

The provided code is correct and secure. The KeyStore is being loaded from a local file not a remote URL. The KeyStore is protected by a strong password that is not hard-coded. The KeyStore is used properly within the context of the application, i.e., not misused to open a connection or do other unnecessary tasks.

The false positive misuses could be ones that are not related to the provided code or those that do not pose a threat to the security of the code.

Therefore, the list remains as it is.
