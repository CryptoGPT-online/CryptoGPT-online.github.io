### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Encryption Without Secure Randomness" and "Key Generation Without SecureRandom" are false positives. The `KeyGenerator` class in Java by default uses a secure random source for key generation. Unless there is a specific requirement or known issue with the default `SecureRandom` implementation on the platform, it is not necessary to explicitly specify a secure random source.

2. "Lack of Algorithm Parameters Specification" is a false positive in the context of RC4. RC4 is a stream cipher and does not use an initialization vector (IV) or operate in block modes like CBC that would require an IV. Therefore, specifying an IV is not applicable for RC4.

3. "Use of ECB Mode" is a false positive because RC4 is a stream cipher and does not have different modes of operation like block ciphers do. ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode is a concern for block ciphers, not stream ciphers.

4. "Improper Error Handling" is not directly related to cryptographic API misuse. While it is a valid concern for secure coding practices, it does not fit the context of cryptographic API misuse.
