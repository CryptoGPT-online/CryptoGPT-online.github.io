### False Positive Misuse ###

- **Predictable Salt**
  - The report claiming that the salt is predictable is a false positive in this context. While the salt is derived from a hardcoded map, this does not necessarily make it predictable if the map is modified to use random or varied byte values. The main issue is that the size and method of construction do not ensure randomness or long-term security, but predictability can be mitigated by using random values even from a map.
