### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-326: The misuse that mentions "The key length specified is 16 bits" is a false positive. This is likely to be a misunderstanding because `int keyLength = 16;` refers to 16 bytes (which is 128 bits) since Java measures encryption key length in bytes, not bits. This is suitable for secure encryption.
   
2. CWE-327: The misuse that refers to the use of `PBEKeySpec` without specifying the algorithm and assuming it's using a weak one is a potential false positive. The `PBEKeySpec` constructor without an algorithm parameter will use the default algorithm provided by the JCA Provider that's being used. It could be a strong algorithm, depending on the provider configuration during runtime, which we can't infer from the static code. So as an auditor, you would need further information about the default algorithm being used by the provider at runtime to accurately classify this as a misuse.
