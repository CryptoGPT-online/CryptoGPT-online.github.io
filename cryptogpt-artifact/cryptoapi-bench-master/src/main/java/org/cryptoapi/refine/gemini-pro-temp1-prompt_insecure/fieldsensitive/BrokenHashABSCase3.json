### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Broken Hash Function (CWE-547)**: The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used. However, the code is not actually using the hash function to verify the integrity of any data, so this misuse is a false positive.
2. **Weak Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-256)**: The code is using MD5 for hashing, which is considered weak. However, the code is not actually using the hash function to protect any sensitive data, and it is not being used to verify the integrity of any important data, so this misuse is also a false positive.
