### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" in both the second and third JSONs is a false positive. The reason for this is as follows:

Java's `KeyPairGenerator` automatically uses a secure, properly seeded `SecureRandom` instance for key generation if the developer does not explicitly provide one. The code provided does not specify a `SecureRandom` instance, but unless there's additional information to suggest the default `SecureRandom` is not secure in the application's context (e.g., on a specific platform or Java version), it is safe to assume that the key generation process is using adequately random values.

Moreover, falsely implying that `SecureRandom` is insecure without proper evidence can lead developers to make unnecessary changes that might not improve security.

Therefore, issues related to CWE-330 should be removed from the final list of misuses.
