### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Hardcoded Crypto Keys" - This is a false positive because the code does not show any encryption key usage, and the empty string in `crypto.encrypt("abc","")` is not used as a key but as an algorithm identifier, which defaults to the `crypto` instance variable.

2. "Missing Encryption" - This is a false positive because the code is not intended for encryption but for hashing. The `System.out.println(md.digest())` is not exposing encrypted data but a hash digest.

3. "Improper Clearing of Heap Memory Before Release ('Heap Inspection') (CWE-244)" - This is a false positive because the code is not dealing with sensitive data that would remain in heap memory after use. The misuse is related to printing the hash to the console, which is a separate concern.

4. "Inappropriate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)" - This is a false positive because the code is not performing encryption, so the strength of encryption is not applicable. The concern about specifying a Charset is valid, but it is not related to encryption strength.
