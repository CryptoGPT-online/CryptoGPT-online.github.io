### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Predictable Key Generation**:  
   - **Explanation**: The report assumes that not specifying the key size may lead to using a weak key size like 128 bits. However, for AES, 128 bits is a standard, secure key size specified by NIST. While 256 bits may provide additional security, 128 bits is not considered insecure. Thus, this is a false positive.
