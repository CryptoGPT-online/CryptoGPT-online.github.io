### False Positive Misuse ###

After reviewing the provided Java code and the corresponding misuse reports, it is concluded that there are no cryptographic API misuses present. The code snippet simply attempts to create an instance of `MessageDigest` using the "SHA-256" algorithm, which is a secure and widely accepted hashing algorithm for generating cryptographic hashes. There are no misuse lists provided that have items for review, leaving us with empty misuse reports. Therefore, there are no false positives to identify as the misuse lists themselves are already empty.
