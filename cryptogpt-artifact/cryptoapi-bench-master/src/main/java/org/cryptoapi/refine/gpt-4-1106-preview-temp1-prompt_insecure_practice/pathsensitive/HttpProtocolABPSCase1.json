Based on the provided Java code snippet, it appears that there is no cryptographic API being used at all. The code simply involves a conditional statement that changes the URL string based on the value of `choice` and then prints out a new `URL` object created with the given URL string.

Since there are no cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, hashing, or any use of cryptographic keys, there are no cryptographic API misuses to report. The misuse lists provided are empty, which is accurate for this code snippet.

### False Positive Misuse ###
There are no cryptographic API misuses in the provided code, so any reported misuses would be false positives.
