### False Positives:
1. The hardcoded "changeit" default key in this context is not a false positive. In many applications, "changeit" is the default password for the keystore and this hardcoded key can't be changed without modifying the source code. This is a widely used, well-known password and its usage is safe within a controlled environment where the source code is not widely distributed.

2. The use of insecure SecureRandom generation is not a false positive either. However, while generating a random number, this code is not storing the result, making it useless in a practical context.
