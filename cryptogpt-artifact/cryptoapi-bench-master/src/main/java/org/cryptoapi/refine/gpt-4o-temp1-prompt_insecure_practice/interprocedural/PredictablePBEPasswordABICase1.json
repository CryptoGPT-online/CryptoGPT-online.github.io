### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Insufficient Key Length**  
   It appears multiple times in different wordings across several lists, indicating a true misuse rather than a false positive. However, "Insecure Key Length", "Weak Key Length", and redundancies in descriptions are consolidated.
   
2. **Insufficient Key Size**
   It is essentially the same as other "Insufficient Key Length" findings, hence not considered a separate false positive.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Hardcoded Password",
        "vulnerable_code": "String password = \"sagar\";",
        "description": "The code uses a hardcoded password which is insecure as it can be easily retrieved from the compiled code or source repository.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure method for obtaining the password, such as prompting the user to enter it at runtime."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Insufficient Key Length",
        "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
        "description": "The specified key length of 16 bits is insecure and does not provide sufficient security. Key lengths less than 128 bits are considered insecure for encryption purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Use a key length of at least 128 bits, such as setting keyLength to 128."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Weak Iteration Count",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "An iteration count of 11010 may not be sufficient to protect against brute-force attacks with modern computing power.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count significantly to make password-based key generation more secure, typically 100,000 iterations or more depending on the application's requirements."
    }
]
``` 

This optimized list consolidates the key length issues and removes redundancies while retaining all distinct misuse reports.
