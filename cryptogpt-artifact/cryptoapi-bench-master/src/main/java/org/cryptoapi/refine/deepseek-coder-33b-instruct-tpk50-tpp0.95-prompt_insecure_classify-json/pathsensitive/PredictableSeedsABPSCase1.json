### False Positive Misuse ###
{
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "P1.main(String [])",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "The seed used for the SecureRandom object is not random and can be easily guessed or manipulated.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using `setSeed` with an insecure seed. Use the default constructor for `SecureRandom`. If a seed is required, ensure it is generated using a secure random number generator."

        "description": "Hard-coding the seed for a cryptographic operation can lead to predictable results, which can compromise the security of the application.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator or a key derivation function (KDF) that generates a random seed each time it's called, instead of a hardcoded seed."
