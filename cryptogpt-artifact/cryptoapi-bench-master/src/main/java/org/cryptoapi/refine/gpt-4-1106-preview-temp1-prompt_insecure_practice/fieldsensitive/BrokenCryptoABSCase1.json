### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Insecure Randomness" - The KeyGenerator does not need to be explicitly initialized with a secure randomness source for key generation as it uses a platform-default secure random source.
2. "Hardcoded Crypto Algorithm" - While it is true that the algorithm is hardcoded, this is not inherently a misuse but rather a design choice that affects flexibility. It becomes a misuse if the hardcoded algorithm is insecure or deprecated, which is the case here with DES.
3. "No Key Management" - This is a design consideration rather than a direct misuse of the cryptographic API. However, it is a valid security concern that should be addressed in a complete system.
4. "Use of getInstance() with Default Algorithm" - This is not a misuse per se, as the algorithm is intended for key generation. The misuse is in the choice of the algorithm itself (DES), not the use of `getInstance()` method.
5. "Improper Initialization Vector" - This is not applicable since ECB mode does not use an IV. However, the use of ECB mode is itself a misuse.
