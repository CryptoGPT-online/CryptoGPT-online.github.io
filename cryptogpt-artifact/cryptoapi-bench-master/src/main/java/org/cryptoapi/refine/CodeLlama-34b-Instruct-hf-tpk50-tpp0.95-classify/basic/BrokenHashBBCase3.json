 ### Optimized Misuse JSON

[
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
"description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is a broken cryptographic hash function that is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions and should not be used in new code.",
"recommendation": "Replace the MD4 algorithm with a stronger, more secure cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. These algorithms are widely used and have been extensively tested and reviewed for security vulnerabilities."
