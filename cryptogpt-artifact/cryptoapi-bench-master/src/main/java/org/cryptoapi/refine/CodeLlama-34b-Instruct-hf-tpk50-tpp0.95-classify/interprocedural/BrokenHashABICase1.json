 Here is the optimized misuse JSON:

            "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
            "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
            "description": "The method `getMessageDigestInstance(String algorithm)` takes the name of a cryptographic algorithm as an argument. The implementation of this method in the SunJCE provider is vulnerable to a misuse attack, where an attacker can supply a malicious algorithm that computes a collision with SHA-1. This can be used to compromise the security of the application. The recommended solution is to use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
            "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, and avoid using any algorithms that are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks."

            "description": "The code uses the SHA1 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as SHA256 or SHA512.",
