    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The method random.nextBytes(salt) is used to generate a salt value. However, the salt value is not long enough (only 32 bytes) to ensure sufficient randomness and uniqueness.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a longer random salt value, such as 128 bits (16 bytes), using a cryptographically secure random number generator."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt,passedCount);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec requires a strong and random salt, but in this code, a weak and inadequate salt is generated using a SecureRandom instance. Also, the count value used for the iterations in the password-based encryption is hardcoded to the value of passedCount, which may not be a secure and sufficient value.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong and random salt using a cryptographically secure random number generator. Use an iteration count that is appropriate for the chosen encryption algorithm. Increase the iteration count to ensure stronger encryption."

  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "new PBEParameterSpec(salt,passedCount);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is being used with a single integer value as the iteration count. This usage does not provide sufficient control over the key derivation process and may use a weak or insecure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2, that allows for specification of the iteration count and other parameters."
