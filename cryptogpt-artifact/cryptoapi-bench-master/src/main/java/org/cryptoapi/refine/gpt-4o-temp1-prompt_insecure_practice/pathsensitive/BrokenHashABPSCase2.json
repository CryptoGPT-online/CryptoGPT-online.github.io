### False Positive Misuse ###

Upon reviewing the provided code, it is clear that although `MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")` is initially called, it is conditionally overridden by `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")` when `choice > 1`. Given the variable `choice` is initialized with a value of 2, the condition is always true, and as a result, the actual hashing algorithm used is SHA-256, which is a secure hash function. Consequently, the misuse reports related to the usage of MD5 are not applicable in this particular context and can be considered false positives.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

Given the analysis above and the context in which the code operates, there are no applicable cryptographic API misuses detected in the provided code. Therefore, the optimized misuse list is empty:
