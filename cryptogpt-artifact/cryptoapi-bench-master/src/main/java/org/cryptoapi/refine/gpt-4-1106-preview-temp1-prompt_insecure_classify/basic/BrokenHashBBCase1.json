### False Positive Misuse ###
The provided code snippet indeed uses SHA-1, which is a deprecated and a weak hash function as per the current cryptographic standards due to known vulnerabilities that allow for collision attacks. Therefore, there are no false positives in the misuse reports. All the reported issues accurately highlight the use of SHA-1 as a potential security risk.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
The misuse reports given are all essentially describing the same issue with different wording. Since they are repetitive and provide no additional unique information, it is sufficient to report this misuse once in an optimized way. Here is an optimized and concise report of the cryptographic API misuse:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
        "description": "SHA-1 is susceptible to collision attacks and is considered insecure for cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Replace SHA-1 with a more secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
