### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com");`
   - **Reasoning:** This misuse is a false positive because the URL is used to load the cacerts keystore, not to encrypt data. The cacerts keystore is a trusted certificate store used by the JVM to verify SSL certificates. Using a URL to load the cacerts keystore is not considered a security risk.

"vulnerable_method": "P3.method2",
"vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
"description": "Loading the keystore from a URL (\"https://www.google.com\") is not secure, as it may be intercepted or modified by an attacker. Additionally, using the same password (\"changeit\") for both the keystore and the key to decrypt it weakens the security of the keystore.",
"recommendation": "Load the keystore from a secure location, such as a local file or a hardware security module (HSM). Use different passwords for the keystore and the key to decrypt it to enhance security."
