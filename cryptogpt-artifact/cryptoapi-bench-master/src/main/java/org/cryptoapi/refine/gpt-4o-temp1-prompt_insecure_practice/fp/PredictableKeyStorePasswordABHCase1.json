### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Insecure URL Connection (CWE-295):**
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `cacerts = new URL("https://www.google.com"); ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), new String(keyBytes).toCharArray());`
   - **Reason:** While it's advisable to verify SSL certificates and ensure the integrity of data, the provided code snippet uses HTTPS, and the misuse does not directly relate to cryptographic API misuses. The focus here should be on the keystore operation rather than the network layer which is out of scope for the snippet provided.
