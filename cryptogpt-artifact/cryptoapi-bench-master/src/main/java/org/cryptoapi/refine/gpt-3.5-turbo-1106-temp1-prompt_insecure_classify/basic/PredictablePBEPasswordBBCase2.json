```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey,salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec for password-based encryption, but it uses a single-character key 's' which is too weak for encryption purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and randomly generated passphrase for password-based encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a salt for password-based encryption, but the length of the salt is fixed at 16 bytes, which may not provide sufficient randomness for the cryptographic operation.",
    "recommendation": "Use a larger salt length, at least 128 bits (16 bytes), to improve the randomness of the salt and the security of the password-based encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010; int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The iteration count and key length used for password-based encryption are not following best practices for encryption strength. The iteration count and key length should be chosen to provide an appropriate level of security against brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a higher iteration count and a longer key length to increase the encryption strength."
