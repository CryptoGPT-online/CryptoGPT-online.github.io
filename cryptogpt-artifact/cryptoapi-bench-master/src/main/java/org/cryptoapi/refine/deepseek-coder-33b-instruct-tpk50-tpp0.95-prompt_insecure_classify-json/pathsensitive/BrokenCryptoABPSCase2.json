Based on the code and misuse lists provided, the false positive misuse is:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");",
        "description": "This code uses the Blowfish algorithm instead of AES. Blowfish is a strong algorithm but has a 64-bit block size, which is vulnerable to birthday attack and does not meet the key length requirement of AES.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using AES encryption algorithm for symmetric encryption. In Java, you can use `Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\")` to get AES encryption algorithm. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely used and considered secure."
    }
]
```
This misuse is false positive as the code actually uses AES algorithm. The key generation for AES encryption is done without specifying the key size, which may lead to insecure encryption if the key is leaked. However, this vulnerability is not considered dangerous due to the reason that the programmer cannot control the key material. 

The optimized JSON array of cryptographic API misuses:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_method": "B2::go(int)",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
        "description": "The key generation for AES encryption is done without specifying the key size, which may lead to insecure encryption if the key is leaked.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the key size when generating the key. For example, for AES use KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", \"BC\") or KeyGenerator.getInstance(256)."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_method": "B2::go(int)",
        "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "In this code, the developer chose 'AES' as the encryption algorithm and 'CBC' as the mode of operation. 'CBC' should not be used as it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "For block ciphers, the mode of operation 'ECB' is secure. It is recommended to replace 'CBC' with 'ECB' in the cipher creation line."
    }
]
```
This provides an optimized list of cryptographic API misuses without the false positive misuse.
