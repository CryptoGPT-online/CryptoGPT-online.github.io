### False Positive Misuse ###

None of the misuses in the provided lists were false positives.

**Explanation:**

* The misuse "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" is a valid misuse. The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is considered insecure and vulnerable to collision attacks.
* The misuse "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation" is not applicable to the provided code. The code does not perform any certificate validation.
* The misuse "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" is not applicable to the provided code. The code does not generate any random values.
* The misuse "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" is not applicable to the provided code. The code does not perform any encryption.
* The misuse "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" is not applicable to the provided code. The code does not use any hardcoded credentials.
* The misuse "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation" is not applicable to the provided code. The code does not perform any algorithm negotiation.
