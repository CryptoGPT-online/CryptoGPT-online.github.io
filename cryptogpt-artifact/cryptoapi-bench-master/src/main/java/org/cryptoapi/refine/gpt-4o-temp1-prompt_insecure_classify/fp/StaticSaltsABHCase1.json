### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse categorized as "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" with the description "The salt value is derived from a hardcoded value in a map, which acts like a hardcoded credential" is a false positive. The value being derived from a hardcoded map does not directly constitute the misuse of hardcoded credentials because, in this context, the value is used as a component of a salt, not as a direct credential or key.
