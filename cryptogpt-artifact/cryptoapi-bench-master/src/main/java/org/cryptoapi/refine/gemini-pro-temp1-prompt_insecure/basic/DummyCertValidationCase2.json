    "vulnerable_method": "D2.checkClientTrusted",
    "vulnerable_code": "public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {}",
    "description": "The `D2` class implements the `X509TrustManager` interface without performing any certificate validation. This means that any certificate presented by the server will be accepted, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Implement the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods to perform proper certificate validation. You can use the `X509Certificate` class and its methods, such as `verify`, to validate certificates against a trusted certificate authority (CA) or using other criteria."

    "description": "The `D2` class implements the `X509TrustManager` interface without providing any implementation for the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods. This means that the class will always trust any certificate presented to it, which is a security risk.",

    "description": "The code returns an empty array from `getAcceptedIssuers()`, which means that the trust manager will trust any certificate presented by the server. This is insecure because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.",

    "vulnerable_method": "D2",
    "vulnerable_code": "new D2()",
    "description": "The code is using the `D2` class as an `X509TrustManager`, which is insecure because it does not perform any certificate validation and accepts all certificates. This means that an attacker could present a malicious certificate to the application, and the application would trust it.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure `X509TrustManager` implementation that performs certificate validation, such as the `X509TrustManager` class provided by the Java API."
