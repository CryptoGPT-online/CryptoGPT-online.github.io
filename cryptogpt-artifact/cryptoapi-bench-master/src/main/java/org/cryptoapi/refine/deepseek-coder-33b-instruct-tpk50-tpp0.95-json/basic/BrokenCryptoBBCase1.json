False Positive Misuses:
- [ ] Weak Crypto Algorithm: The misuse code does not contain a vulnerable part. The DES algorithm is considered weak and should not be used for new applications.
- [ ] Broken Cryptography: The DES algorithm is not considered secure for modern applications and has been broken multiple times.
- [ ] Inadequate Entropy: The length of the key is not considered inadequate. The key length of DES is 56 bits, which is enough for a good number of use cases.
- [ ] Broken Padding: The code does not contain a vulnerable padding part. PKCS5Padding is not a vulnerable padding scheme in itself.
- [x] Weak Encryption Algorithm: The misuse code does not contain a vulnerable part. The DES encryption algorithm is considered weak and should not be used for new applications.

        "recommendation": "Use AES for encryption instead of DES. Replace the \"DES\" string in the KeyGenerator.getInstance() method with \"AES\". Also, change \"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\" to \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" or \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\". For mode of operation, you can consider using CBC or GCM modes."
