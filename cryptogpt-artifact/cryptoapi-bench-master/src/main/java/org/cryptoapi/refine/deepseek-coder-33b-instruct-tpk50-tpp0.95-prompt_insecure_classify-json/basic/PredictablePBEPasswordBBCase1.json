### False Positive Misuse:###
[

        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
        "description": "Low iteration count and key length make the encryption vulnerable to attacks",
        "recommendation": "To increase the security, increase the iteration count and the key length."

### Optimized Misuse JSON:###
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
        "description": "The code is using PBE (Password-Based Encryption) which is generally considered weak cryptographic algorithm due to its vulnerability against brute force attacks. Also, it uses a low number of iteration count (11010) and key length (16).",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which provides higher security. Additionally, increase the iteration count to at least 100,000 to slow down brute force attacks, and consider using a key length of at least 256 bits for high security."
