### False Positive Misuse ###

- The misuse related to "Insecure Output Encoding" or "Improper Output Encoding" or "Insufficient Output Encoding" is a false positive in the context of security. While it is true that printing a binary digest directly to the console is not the best way to represent the hash, it does not pose a security risk. It is more of a usability or data representation issue rather than a security vulnerability.
