### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Lack of Secure Randomness in Key Generation" and "Key Generation without SecureRandom" are false positives. The `KeyGenerator` class by default uses a secure random source for key generation. Unless there is a specific requirement or known issue with the default randomness source, it is not necessary to explicitly specify a `SecureRandom` instance.

2. "Insecure Initialization Vector (IV)" is a false positive because the DES algorithm in ECB mode does not use an IV. While ECB is insecure for other reasons, the lack of an IV is not applicable here.

3. "Static Crypto Variables" is a false positive. While the use of static variables for cryptographic purposes can lead to thread-safety issues, there is no direct evidence in the provided code that this leads to a security vulnerability. The variables are private and only used within the class, and their values are derived from constants that represent the cryptographic algorithm and mode.

4. "Insecure padding scheme" and "Inadequate Padding Scheme" are false positives. PKCS5Padding is not inherently insecure; the vulnerability arises when it is used with CBC mode without proper error handling. Since the code uses ECB mode, which is not secure for other reasons, the padding scheme is not the primary concern.
