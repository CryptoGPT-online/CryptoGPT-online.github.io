### False Positive Misuse ###
None. All reported misuses correctly identify an actual security vulnerability in the code.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) { return true; }",
    "description": "The code always returns true for hostname verification, which means it does not actually verify the hostname against the certificate. This can allow man-in-the-middle attacks as any certificate, even ones not matching the hostname, will be accepted.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by returning 'true' only if the hostname matches the one in the server's certificate. Use existing utility methods like HTTPSURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier to correctly handle hostname verification."
