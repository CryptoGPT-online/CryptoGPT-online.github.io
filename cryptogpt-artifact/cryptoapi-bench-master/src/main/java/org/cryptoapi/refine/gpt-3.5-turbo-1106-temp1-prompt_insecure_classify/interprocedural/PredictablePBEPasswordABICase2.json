```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static String KEY = \"sagar\";",
    "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded in the code, which makes it vulnerable to credential disclosure.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random encryption key at runtime or retrieve it from a secure storage."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey,salt,10000,16);",
    "description": "The code is using the outdated and weak PBEKeySpec algorithm for password-based encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Replace PBEKeySpec with a stronger password-based encryption algorithm such as Argon2 or bcrypt."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The code is using the default SecureRandom constructor which does not specify a specific algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a SecureRandom constructor that specifies a strong random number generation algorithm such as SHA1PRNG or NativePRNG."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey,salt,10000,16);",
    "description": "The encryption strength is inadequate because the iteration number is set to a low value (10000) and the key length is set to a small value (16).",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration number and use a longer key length to improve encryption strength."
  }
