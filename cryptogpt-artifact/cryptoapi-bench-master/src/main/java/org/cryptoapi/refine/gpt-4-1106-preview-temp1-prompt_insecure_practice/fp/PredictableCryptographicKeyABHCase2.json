### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Use of Platform Default Charset" is a false positive because the code does not show the use of the default charset. The `getBytes()` method is used without specifying a charset, which indeed uses the platform's default charset, but this is not a misuse in itself. It becomes a misuse if the bytes are interpreted on a different platform with a different default charset.

2. "Use of ECB Mode" is a false positive because the code provided does not show the use of any cipher mode. The `SecretKeySpec` is just a key specification and does not imply the use of ECB mode. The misuse would be valid if the code showed the instantiation of a `Cipher` object using ECB mode.
