### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. The code demonstrates the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is known to have vulnerabilities and is considered cryptographically broken. All the misuse reports consistently point out the same issue, indicating that these are not false positives.
