False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse list contains false positives. "N/A" is the default response when no misuse or insecure usage of cryptography APIs are detected, but it should be removed in the case of this code. The misuse category "N/A" does not provide any additional information.

Please verify and consider optimizing the code to make it more secure. The hostname should not be hardcoded and instead should be dynamic or at least verified against a whitelist of known valid values. Furthermore, SSL certificate pinning or a hostname verifier library should be used to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
