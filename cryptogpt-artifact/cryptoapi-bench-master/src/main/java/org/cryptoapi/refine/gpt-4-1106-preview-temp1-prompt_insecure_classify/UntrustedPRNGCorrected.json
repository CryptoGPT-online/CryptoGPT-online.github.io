Based on the provided code snippet and the misuse lists, it seems that there are no specific cryptographic API misuses reported. The Java code given merely initializes a `SecureRandom` instance and uses it to generate a random integer, which is then printed out. Since there are no cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, hashing, or key generation involved in the code snippet provided, there would be no context for identifying cryptographic API misuses.

`SecureRandom` is a widely recommended random number generator for cryptographic purposes, and its use here does not exhibit signs of misuse. Simply generating a random number does not constitute a misuse of cryptographic APIs, as there is no context provided that might suggest insecure handling of sensitive information.

### False Positive Misuse ###
No cryptographic API misuse is reported in the provided lists, and the usage of `SecureRandom` in the given code snippet does not show any signs of misuse based on the information provided.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
Since there was no misuse reported, the optimized list would remain empty as well:

```json
