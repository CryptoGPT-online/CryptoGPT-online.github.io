 ### False Positive Misuse JSON ###

The following misuses are considered false positives:

1. Insecure Random Number Generation: The misuse reports that the `KeyGenerator` class uses a random number generator that may be insecure. However, the `KeyGenerator` class is only used to generate a secret key, which is stored securely and not exposed to attackers.
2. Hardcoded Secret Key: The misuse reports that the secret key is hardcoded, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as key reuse and key exposure. However, the secret key is only used internally and is not exposed to attackers.
3. Incorrect Crypto Algorithm: The misuse reports that the `Cipher` class uses an incorrect crypto algorithm. However, the misuse does not specify which algorithm is incorrect and what the correct algorithm should be. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the misuse is a false positive or not.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

Here is the optimized JSON response, with the false positive misuses removed:
