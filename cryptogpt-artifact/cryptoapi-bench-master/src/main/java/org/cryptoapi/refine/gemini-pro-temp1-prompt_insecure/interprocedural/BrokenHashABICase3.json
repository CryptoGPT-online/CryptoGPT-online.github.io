    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String)",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD4 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
