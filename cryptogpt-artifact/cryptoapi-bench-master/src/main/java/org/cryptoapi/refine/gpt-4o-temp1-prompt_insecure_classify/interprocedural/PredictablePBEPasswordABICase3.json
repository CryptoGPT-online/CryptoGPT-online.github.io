### False Positive Misuse ###
No false positives were identified in the provided misuse list. Both reported issues reflect genuine concerns:

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength** - The key length of 16 bits is indeed inadequate for secure encryption purposes.
   
2. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials** - Hardcoding the password in the source code is a legitimate vulnerability and should be avoided.
