### False Positive Misuse JSON

{
"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)));",
"description": "The use of a weak iteration count for key generation using PBE can lead to a vulnerability in the encryption scheme.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger iteration count, such as 65536 or more, and consider using a more secure key derivation function such as Argon2 or bcrypt."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
"description": "The use of a weak random number generator can lead to a predictable salt value, which can be used to compromise the encryption scheme.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the salt value."
}
]
}

### Optimized Misuse JSON

{
"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_COUNT = \"20\";",
"description": "The use of a hardcoded encryption key, which can be easily obtained and used by an attacker to compromise the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random key generator and make sure the key is stored securely and not hardcoded."
},

{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "private static char[] count;",
"description": "The use of hardcoded credentials, such as a password or encryption key, can make the system vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Do not hardcode credentials and make sure to store them securely."
},

{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
"description": "The use of a random number generator that may not be secure enough to produce a truly random number, which can make the encryption vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom`, and make sure to properly seed it with a secure random source."
