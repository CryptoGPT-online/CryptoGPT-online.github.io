 ### False Positive Misuse ###

* Misuse: Broken Crypto Algorithm
	+ Vulnerable Code: sr.setSeed(seed);
	+ Description: Using a predictable seed with SecureRandom can lead to insecure random number generation. In this case, the seed is set to a fixed byte array, which can be easily predicted by an attacker.
	+ Recommendation: Use a secure and unpredictable seed, such as a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
