### False Positive Misuse ###
{
    "misuse category": "Insecure Crypto Algorithm Usage",
    "vulnerable_method": "B6.go",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code is using a statically defined crypto algorithm, which is a major misuse. The algorithm is a field of the class B6, which may be manipulated at runtime. This allows an attacker to modify the crypto algorithm at runtime, potentially allowing them to use a less secure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a static field for the crypto algorithm, consider using a parameter or a method to allow it to be determined at runtime."

Here, the first misuse list actually shows a false positive. The misuse "Insecure Crypto Algorithm Usage" is identified as the misuse category, while the code doesn't use a user-provided crypto algorithm, it uses the field value `crypto` which can be changed at runtime by the `go2()` and `go3()` methods, but those methods are never called. Thus, the field `crypto` is not used as a user-input. Thus, this misuse has been removed from the final optimized list. The other misuses have been kept in the optimized list, as they are all valid misuses in the given code snippet.
