 Here is the JSON response:

### False Positive Misuses

* "Broken Crypto Algorithm" misuse report on line 33: This is a false positive as the `KeyGenerator` class is used to generate a secure cryptographic key, which is then used for encryption.
* "Insecure Random Number Generation" misuse report on line 38: This is a false positive as the `IvParameterSpec` class is used to generate a secure initialization vector for the cipher, which is then used for encryption.

"description": "The use of AES in CBC mode with PKCS5Padding is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, as the attacker can determine whether the padding is valid or not by the response of the server. This can be exploited to decrypt the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use AES in GCM mode or ChaCha20-Poly1305 instead, as they are resistant to padding oracle attacks."
