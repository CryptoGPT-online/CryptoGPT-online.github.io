    "vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec with a weak algorithm (PBEWithMD5AndDES). This algorithm is known to be insecure and should not be used. PBEWithMD5AndDES is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong algorithm like PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 instead."

    "misuse category": "Iteration Count Too Low",
    "vulnerable_method": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
    "description": "The iteration count is too low. This makes the key derivation function easier to brute-force.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 100,000."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
    "vulnerable_method": "String password = \"sagar\";",
    "vulnerable_code": "String password = \"sagar\";",
    "description": "The password is hard-coded in the source code, which allows attackers to easily obtain it.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure method to generate and store the password, such as a password manager."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "Inadequate Key Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length of 16 bytes is inadequate for modern security standards. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits (32 bytes).",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 256 bits (32 bytes)."

    "misuse category": "Weak Key Derivation Function",

    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The PBEKeySpec constructor uses the default key derivation function (KDF), which is not considered to be secure. An attacker could potentially use a brute-force attack to recover the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt."

  {
    "misuse category": "Improper Storage of Sensitive Information",
    "vulnerable_method": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The password is stored in memory as a char array, which is insecure. An attacker could potentially access the memory and retrieve the password in plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as a password manager or a hardware security module (HSM)."
