### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. All five misuse reports correctly point out the use of MD4, a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm, which should indeed be replaced by a more secure alternative such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. Therefore, all misuse reports are correctly identifying a vulnerability in the code.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
        "description": "MD4 is a cryptographic hash function that is known to be broken and vulnerable to collisions. It is no longer considered secure for use in cryptographic protocols.",
        "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
```

By providing a single report, we remove the redundancy while maintaining the necessary information to address the cryptographic API misuse.
