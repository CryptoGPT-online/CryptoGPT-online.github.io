### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
   - The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) specifies that the `KeyGenerator` class is designed to use a system-provided source of randomness unless otherwise instructed. By default, if a `SecureRandom` instance is not provided, the KeyGenerator is expected to use a secure system-provided source of randomness that is suitable for cryptographic use, and thus `KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")` is not inherently insecure. This report has been identified as a false positive.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.
   - This case is similar to CWE-330 above. The default key size for AES is 128 bits, which is not considered weak or inadequate by current standards. The use of 256-bit keys is stronger but not strictly necessary for most applications. Unless there are specific requirements for key lengths beyond 128 bits, this is not a misuse of the API. This report has also been identified as a false positive.

These misuses are therefore going to be removed from the resulting optimized list as false positives.
