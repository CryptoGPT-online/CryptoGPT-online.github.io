    "description": "The code uses AES in CBC mode with PKCS5Padding, which are not broken or risky algorithms. However, it is important to note that the security of AES-CBC depends on the proper use of initialization vectors (IVs) and the prevention of padding oracle attacks. This code uses a hardcoded IV instead of generating a random IV for each encryption operation, which can weaken the security. ",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for each encryption operation using a secure random number generator and update the code to use the dynamically generated random IV. For example, generate a random IV using SecureRandom: byte[] iv = new byte[16]; SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().nextBytes(iv); and use iv as the IV parameter in cipher.init()."
