[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C2(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "The code is using the MD5 cryptographic algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto.encrypt(\"abc\",\"\");",
    "description": "The encryption function is using a blank or empty string as the algorithm. This may result in weak encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a strong and secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or RSA, instead of using an empty string as the algorithm."
