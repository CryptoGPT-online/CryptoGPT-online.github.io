### False Positive Misuse ###
There are some false positive misuses in the provided list, including duplicate misuses related to insecure randomness and weak cryptographic hash. Both misuses pertain to the same code snippet and should be consolidated into a single entry. 

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "count = 1050;",
    "description": "The count value is directly set to 1050 based on a simple condition, without considering the recommended iteration count for the chosen algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a sufficiently high and pre-determined iteration count for the chosen PBE algorithm, rather than hard-coding it based on a simple condition."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance 'random' is used to generate bytes for the salt, but it's unclear if the random number generator has been seeded or configured properly for cryptographic security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more specific and secure random number generator like SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()"
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-329: Not Using Secure Randomness",
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance 'random' should be explicitly initialized with a strong algorithm and provider to ensure the generated salt is cryptographically secure.",
    "recommendation": "Initialize the SecureRandom instance with a strong algorithm and provider, e.g., 'SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()'."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Weak Cryptographic Hash", 
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code is using SecureRandom to generate bytes for salt, but it's not using a secure algorithm for hashing.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256 for generating the salt."
