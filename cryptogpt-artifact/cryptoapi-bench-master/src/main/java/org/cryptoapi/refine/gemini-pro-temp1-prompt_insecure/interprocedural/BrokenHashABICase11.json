```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "Weak Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)",
    "vulnerable_method": "method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses MD4 as the cryptographic hash algorithm, which is considered weak and insecure due to known collision attacks. Attackers can easily find two different messages that produce the same MD4 hash, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a strong and secure cryptographic hash algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
