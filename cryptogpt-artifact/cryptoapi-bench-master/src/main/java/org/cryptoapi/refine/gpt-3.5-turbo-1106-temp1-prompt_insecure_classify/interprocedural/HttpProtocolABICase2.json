```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_URL = \"http://www.google.com\";",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded URL as the default value for the URL variable. Hardcoded credentials are insecure because they can be easily discovered and exploited.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded credentials. Instead, use a secure configuration file or external source to store sensitive information."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(url.toString()));",
    "description": "The code is converting the URL to a string and printing it out without any encryption or secure hashing.",
    "recommendation": "If necessary, use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256) to hash the URL before printing it out."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(url.toString()));",
    "description": "The code is not properly validating the SSL/TLS certificates of the URL being accessed. This can expose the application to man-in-the-middle attacks and certificate spoofing.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper SSL/TLS certificate validation mechanism to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the remote server."
