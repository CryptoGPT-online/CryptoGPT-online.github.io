{
"misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_method": "P2.key()",
"vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
"description": "The key length of 16 bytes (128 bits) is considered weak and insecure for modern cryptographic algorithms.",
"recommendation": "Increase the key length to a more secure value, such as 256 bits or higher."
},
{
"misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Weak Key Derivation Function (KDF)",
"vulnerable_method": "P2.key()",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey,salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
"description": "The use of PBEKeySpec with a weak KDF, such as PBKDF2 with a low iteration count, can make it easier for attackers to brute-force the password or passphrase.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure KDF, such as bcrypt or Argon2, and increase the iteration count to make it more difficult for attackers to crack the password."
},
{
"misuse category": "Password-Based Encryption (PBE) with Weak Iteration Count",
"vulnerable_method": "P2.key()",
"vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
"description": "The iteration count for PBKDF2 is set to a low value, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. A higher iteration count, e.g., 100,000, should be used to increase the computational cost of password guessing.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 100,000 or more, to make brute-force attacks more difficult."
},
{
"misuse category": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Password",
"vulnerable_method": "P2.key()",
"vulnerable_code": "char [] defaultKey = {'s'};",
"description": "Using a hard-coded password for key derivation is insecure, as it can be easily compromised by attackers.",
"recommendation": "Generate a random password or passphrase using a secure random number generator and store it in a secure location."
