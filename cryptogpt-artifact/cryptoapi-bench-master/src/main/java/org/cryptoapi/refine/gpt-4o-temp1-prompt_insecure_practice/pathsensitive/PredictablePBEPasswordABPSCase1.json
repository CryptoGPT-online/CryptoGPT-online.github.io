### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse**: Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `String defaultKey = "saagar";`
   - **Reason**: Upon assessment, the defaultKey is only used in a test scenario when `choice <= 1`. In the given execution, the key is replaced with a securely generated random key when `choice > 1`, which mitigates the risk as intended usage should follow best practices. However, to avoid confusion in the code documentation, ensuring default scenarios are well-explained is beneficial.
