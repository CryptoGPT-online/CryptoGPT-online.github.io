### False Positive Misuse ###

**1.** **Misuse:** Weak Iteration Count for Password Based Encryption
**Vulnerable Code:** count = 1050;
**Description:** The iteration count for the password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm is set too low. This makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password and decrypt the encrypted data.
**Recommendation:** Increase the iteration count to a value that is computationally infeasible for an attacker to brute-force. A good rule of thumb is to use at least 10,000 iterations.

**Explanation:** This misuse is a false positive because the iteration count is being set based on the value of the variable "choice". If the value of "choice" is greater than 1, then the iteration count is set to 1050. However, if the value of "choice" is 1 or less, then the iteration count will be set to a default value that is likely to be higher than 10,000. Therefore, this misuse is not applicable to this code.
