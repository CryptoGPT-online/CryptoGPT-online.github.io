### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Weak Key Generation**

   **Reason for False Positive:** The code does use `KeyGenerator` for generating an AES key, but it's considered a false positive because by itself, `KeyGenerator` often defaults to secure key sizes, depending on the system's security policy. However, it might still be best practice to specify the key size explicitly for clarity, but it doesn't constitute a misuse under typical circumstances.
