  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "C4.<init>",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C4(\"RC4\");",
    "description": "The RC4 algorithm is considered as a broken algorithm and should not be used for encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the use of RC4 with a more secure algorithm such as AES or ChaCha20."

    "vulnerable_method": "C4.encrypt",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The code uses the default `KeyGenerator` to generate a secret key. This may result in insufficiently random keys.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the secret key. For example, `SecureRandom` can be used for this purpose."

    "vulnerable_method": "C4.encrypt",
    "vulnerable_code": "if(passedAlgo.isEmpty()){\n            passedAlgo = defaultAlgo;\n        }",
    "description": "The code uses the default algorithm if the passed algorithm is empty. This may allow an attacker to negotiate a less secure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Validate the passed algorithm before using it. If the algorithm is not secure, reject the connection or use a more secure algorithm."
