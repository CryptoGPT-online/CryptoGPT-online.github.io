### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
   - The reports indicate that the code is improperly validating certificates because it's loading a KeyStore from a hardcoded URL ("https://www.google.com"). However, this is a misunderstanding of the code's functionality. The code is not validating a certificate from this URL; it is intended to load a KeyStore via a network stream from a URL, which does not inherently relate to certificate validation. Certificate validation would happen during an SSL/TLS handshake, which is not shown in the snippet. So without more context showing improper use of TrustManager or HostnameVerifier, we cannot claim improper certificate validation based on this code alone.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   - The use of JKS (Java KeyStore) is marked as insecure compared to PKCS12, which is a recommended format due to stronger cryptographic standards. However, JKS keystores can be configured to use strong algorithms and key sizes. The misuse report does not provide evidence that the JKS keystore in question is configured to use weak cryptography. Thus, simply using a JKS format is not an automatic vulnerability and this is considered a false positive without further context on how the keystore is actually being used and configured.


Based on the review, these misuses should be removed as false positives.
