    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",

    "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm, which is considered secure, but the key generation is missing a specific key size.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the key size when generating the secret key. For example, use KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\") and then call keyGen.init(256) to generate a 256-bit key."

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher =Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code is using a supplied cryptographic algorithm without verifying its security or safety.",
    "recommendation": "Always verify and explicitly specify the cryptographic algorithm to be used, rather than relying on a user input or configuration value."

    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using the \"AES\" algorithm to generate a secret key. The AES algorithm itself is not the issue, but the problem is that it is using the default mode and padding, which is ECB and PKCS5Padding. ECB mode is known to be insecure because it does not provide proper confidentiality. PKCS5Padding is also not the recommended padding scheme for AES.",
    "recommendation": "Update the code to use a secure mode and padding, such as AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding or AES/GCM/NoPadding, instead of the default."

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
    "description": "The use of ECB mode in AES is considered risky as it does not provide sufficient security. It is susceptible to certain patterns and can lead to data leaks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM, instead of ECB."

  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\".",
    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm is hardcoded in the code, making it difficult to update or change in the future.",
    "recommendation": "Store the cryptographic algorithm in a configuration file or retrieve it from user input or a secure source."

    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",

    "description": "The code does not validate or verify the cryptographic algorithm before using it.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a validation mechanism to ensure only approved cryptographic algorithms are used."
