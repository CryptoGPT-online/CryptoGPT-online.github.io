  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"IDEA\"",
    "description": "The code uses the `IDEA` algorithm for encryption, which is considered insecure due to its weak key size and susceptibility to brute-force attacks. Using a weak encryption algorithm can compromise the confidentiality of encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the `IDEA` algorithm with a more secure one, such as `AES` with a key size of at least 128 bits, to ensure adequate encryption strength."

    "misuse category": "CWE-256: Cryptographic Key Generation - Use of Weak Key Generation Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the `KeyGenerator` class to generate a key without specifying a specific algorithm. This can lead to the use of weak key generation algorithms, resulting in weak encryption keys.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a strong key generation algorithm when creating the `KeyGenerator`. For example, `KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");`."

    "description": "The code uses the `Cipher` class to perform encryption/decryption without specifying a specific algorithm. This can lead to the use of weak or insecure algorithms, resulting in insecure encryption/decryption.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a strong encryption algorithm when creating the `Cipher`. For example, `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");`."
