### False Positive Misuse ###
The provided code snippet does not show any explicit cryptographic API misuse. The Java code simply demonstrates creating an SSL socket using the default SSLSocketFactory, and there's no additional configuration or use of the socket that is shown which would allow for an assessment of the cryptographic practices.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[]
```

Since no actual misuse can be identified from the snippet provided, the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses is an empty array, which correctly reflects the inability to determine misuse based on the given code.
