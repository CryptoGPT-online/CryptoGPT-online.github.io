### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Static Salt" reported in the second list is a false positive. The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a new salt for each execution, which is a secure practice. The salt is not hardcoded or static.

2. The misuse "Weak Random Number Generation" reported in the second list is a false positive. The code uses `SecureRandom` without specifying an algorithm, but `SecureRandom` by itself is designed to provide a cryptographically strong random number generator. While specifying an algorithm can be a good practice, the default `SecureRandom` is not inherently weak.

3. The misuse "Insecure Salt Generation" reported in the third list is a false positive. The code correctly uses `SecureRandom` to generate a salt, which is a secure practice. The security of the salt does not depend on the RNG algorithm being specified, as `SecureRandom` is designed to be secure by default.

4. The misuse "Insecure Randomness" reported in the fourth list is a false positive. The code uses `SecureRandom`, which is a secure random number generator. While specifying an algorithm can be beneficial in some cases, the default `SecureRandom` is generally considered secure.
