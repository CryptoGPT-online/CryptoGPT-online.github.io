### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - **Justification:** The code retrieves "bbb" from the hashmap, which has a value of 20, not 1020 as stated in the misuse report. The repeated assertion that it retrieves 1020 is incorrect based on the code. Furthermore, the actual value used is already covered by "CWE-330" misuse for a low iteration count, making this report redundant.

        "vulnerable_code": "int iteration = hm.get(\"bbb\");",
        "description": "The iteration count for the PBE algorithm is being set to a low value (20) retrieved from a hashmap. This is insufficient and does not ensure adequate computational effort for deriving the key, making it easier for attackers to perform brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, typically in the range of tens of thousands or more, depending on security requirements. This will increase the computational workload for brute-force attacks."
