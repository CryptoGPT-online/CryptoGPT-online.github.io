```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"Blowfish\";",
        "description": "The use of Blowfish algorithm is not recommended as it is considered weak and potentially vulnerable to attacks. It has a small block size of 64 bits, making it susceptible to certain attack vectors such as birthday attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger, modern encryption algorithm like AES with at least a 128-bit block size."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Dynamic Algorithm Specification",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto)); Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "Using dynamically specified algorithms with crypto APIs might lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities, especially if the algorithm can be influenced by an attacker.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the cryptographic algorithm explicitly in the code rather than using dynamic assignment."
