### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the misuse reports presented are false positives. They are all consistent in identifying the potential misuse related to the selection of an inadequate RSA key size.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "if (choice>1) keysize = 2048; else keysize = 1024;",
        "description": "The RSA key size of 1024 bits is considered weak and vulnerable to attacks. RSA keys should be at least 2048 bits for sufficient security strength.",
        "recommendation": "Use a minimum key size of 2048 bits for RSA encryption to ensure adequate security strength. Modify the code to always use 2048 bits or higher."
