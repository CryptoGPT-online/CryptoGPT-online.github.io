### False Positive Misuse ###

- "Static IV": This misuse is a false positive because the code generates a new, random IV for each encryption operation, as evident from the `sr.nextBytes(bytes);` call inside the `go()` method. The IV is not static (hardcoded) but is derived from a `SecureRandom` instance, which provides a cryptographically strong source of randomness. Thus, this reported misuse does not apply to the provided code snippet.

Note: The remaining misuses after removing the false positive all relate to:

1. Insecure IV Generation: The misuse regarding IV generation from `nextInt()` leading to insufficient IV size is valid because the method could yield a byte array of less than 16 bytes.

2. Key Generation without specifying a secure random source or a sufficient key size: This is a legitimate concern. Best practice recommends explicitly initializing key generators with desired key sizes and possibly a secure random source.
