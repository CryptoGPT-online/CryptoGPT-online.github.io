### False Positive Misuse ###

- **"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation."**
  - The given code does not perform any network communication, hence this misuse is a false positive.

- **"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values."**
  - This misuse can be considered a false positive because the salt is not hardcoded but rather, derived from the passedAlgo argument.
