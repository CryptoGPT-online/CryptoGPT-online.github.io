### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. The code indeed uses SHA-1, which is a broken cryptographic hash algorithm, and hardcodes it without providing a secure default mechanism elsewhere in the code.

        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C1(\"SHA1\");",
        "description": "The code uses SHA-1, which is a cryptographic hash algorithm considered broken and insecure due to vulnerabilities found (CWE-327). SHA-1 is susceptible to collision attacks, making it unsuitable for security-related purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."

        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm is hardcoded and allows insecure defaults. This is risky as the default is set to SHA1, a broken algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Remove hardcoding and allow secure defaults or configurable algorithms that default to secure choices like SHA-256."
