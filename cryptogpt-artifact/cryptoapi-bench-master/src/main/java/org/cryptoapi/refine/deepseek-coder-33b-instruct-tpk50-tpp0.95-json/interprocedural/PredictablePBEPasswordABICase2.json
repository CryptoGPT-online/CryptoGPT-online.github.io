    "description": "The cryptographic key is hardcoded into the source code. This is a major security risk as an attacker could easily discover this key and use it for decryption.",
    "recommendation": "You should not hardcode sensitive data like cryptographic keys into your source code. Use environment variables or secure key vault systems to store these keys."

[{

    "description": "The code is using the PBEKeySpec with an iteration count of 10000 for key derivation, which is considered insecure as it could lead to brute force attacks. The iteration count should ideally be around 10,000,000 (10 million) or more.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a higher iteration count. For example, 10,000,000 or more, to make it computationally expensive to brute force the key."
