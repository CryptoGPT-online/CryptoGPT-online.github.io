The first misuse report is a false positive, as it only reports the use of ECB mode without considering the context. The other two reports are correct, as they identify the use of a broken cryptographic algorithm and the use of an insufficiently random value.

The optimized misuse JSON includes all three reports, with the first report being labeled as a false positive. The vulnerable code and description for each report are also provided, as well as recommendations for fixing the issues.
