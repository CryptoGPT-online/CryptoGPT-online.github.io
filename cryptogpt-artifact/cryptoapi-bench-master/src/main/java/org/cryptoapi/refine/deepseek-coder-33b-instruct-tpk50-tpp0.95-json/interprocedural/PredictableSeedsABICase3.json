        "description": "The seed for the SecureRandom class should be a true random seed. Using a weak seed such as DEFAULT_SEED can lead to predictable numbers being generated and hence makes the output of the SecureRandom class insecure.",

        "description": "The use of `SecureRandom` with a user-supplied seed is considered insecure. This is because `SecureRandom` is a cryptographically strong random number generator, but if the seed is predictable it makes it easier for an attacker to guess the next number.",
        "recommendation": "Use `SecureRandom` without providing a seed if you want a cryptographically strong random number. If you need to generate a predictable sequence of numbers, consider using `Random` instead."
