### False Positive Misuse ###

There are no false positives in the misuse reports regarding the use of DES algorithm with ECB mode. All reported issues correctly identify DES as a weak and obsolete algorithm, and ECB as an insecure mode due to pattern leakage.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";\nString keyAlgo = \"DES\";",
        "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered broken and unsafe for many decades due to its short key length, which makes it susceptible to brute force attacks. ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode is also insecure as it can leak patterns.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a secure mode like GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) or CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) with proper padding and IV handling. For example, 'AES/GCM/NoPadding' or 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding'."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Cipher Mode",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto); // where crypto is \"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\"",
        "description": "ECB mode is not semantically secure for encryption of multiple blocks of data as it reveals patterns. It should not be used for sensitive data.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode, such as AES/GCM/NoPadding or AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding, with proper initialization vector (IV) management."
    }
]
```

The optimized list consolidates repetitive misuse findings and maintains focus on the key vulnerabilities: the use of DES and ECB mode.
