  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which is not secure for most applications. ECB mode does not provide any confidentiality for repeated plaintext blocks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter mode)."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses the default key generator for AES, which may not be using a cryptographically secure random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate keys. For example, `SecureRandom` class can be used."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code dynamically constructs a cipher instance using the `crypto` variable, which is derived from the DEFAULT_CRYPTO constant. This allows an attacker to specify a weak or insecure cipher algorithm by modifying the value of the `crypto` variable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and secure cipher algorithm, such as `AES/GCM/NoPadding`, and avoid allowing user input to influence the choice of cipher algorithm."
