There are no false positive misuses in the provided code.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
{
  "misuse": "Hardcoded Key",
  "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\";",
  "description": "The use of a hardcoded key 'changeit' can lead to security vulnerabilities as the key is easily accessible and can be exploited by an attacker.",
  "recommendation": "Generate a strong, random key and store it securely. Use a secure mechanism to retrieve the key, such as environment variables, KeyManagementSystem (KMS), or secure configuration files."
},
{
  "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
  "description": "KeyStore.getInstance is using the default SecureRandom implementation, which may not be cryptographically strong.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator by explicitly specifying a SecureRandom implementation when creating KeyStore."
},
{
  "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
  "description": "The code uses the default SecureRandom algorithm for generating cryptographic keys, which may not provide sufficient randomness for security-sensitive applications.",
  "recommendation": "Use a specific SecureRandom implementation such as SHA1PRNG to ensure a more secure source of randomness."
