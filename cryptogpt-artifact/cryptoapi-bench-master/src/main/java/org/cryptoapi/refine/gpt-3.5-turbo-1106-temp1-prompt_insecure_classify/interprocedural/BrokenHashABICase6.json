    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "description": "The code uses the value of 'crypto' variable for selecting the cryptographic algorithm, which can result in the selection of a less secure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that a secure cryptographic algorithm is used, such as SHA-256 or bcrypt, instead of relying on user-input or static values."
