### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse "Hard-coded sensitive data" seems to be false positive. As per your given misuses list and the code provided, the "name" variable is hard-coded, but it's not being used in any sensitive context like password or key generation. Hence, it does not lead to any cryptographic misuse.

    "misuse category": "Insecure Algorithm Selection",

    "description": "The code is using MD2 hashing algorithm, which is considered weak and broken. It might be vulnerable to length extension attacks, and is also no longer recommended for secure hash functions. This leaves room for an attacker to manipulate the choice and thus select the weak algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the MD2 algorithm with a stronger algorithm, like SHA-256, which is considered secure for most purposes. If you need compatibility with existing systems that only support MD2, consider using it only when the choice is less than or equal to 1."
