    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The code is using a hardcoded default key and converting it to bytes. Then, it is limiting the key length to 16 bytes without considering the strength of encryption. This can lead to insufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and random key with sufficient length for AES encryption. Avoid using hardcoded or default keys."
