  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "C2.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is initialized with a seed derived from a single byte, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), which uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate random numbers."
