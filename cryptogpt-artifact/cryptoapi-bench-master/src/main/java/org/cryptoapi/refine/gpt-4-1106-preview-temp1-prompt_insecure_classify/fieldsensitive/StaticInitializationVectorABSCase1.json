### False Positive Misuse ###

There is a common theme for a false positive among the listed misuses, which is relating to the specified encryption key strength. The misuse reporting CWE-326 complains about the lack of a specified key size. However, a deeper look at the code reveals that:

The report itself doesn't provide a solid basis to claim inadequate encryption strength. While it is good practice to specify the key length to avoid ambiguity and ensure strong encryption, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) defaults to a secure key size for AES if not specified. As the default may change or differ between different Java providers and configurations, it can be company policy to always explicitly set the key size. If this is not in the provided company's policy, and with no evidence that the default key size is inadequate (currently, the default is generally considered secure), this report would be considered a false positive.

To correct these points, we can refine the misuse list and remove the instances of CWE-326.
