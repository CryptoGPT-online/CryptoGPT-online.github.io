    "description": "The code is using `AES` with a default key size, which is not considered secure for modern cryptographic applications. It is recommended to use a stronger algorithm such as `AES-256` or `AES-128` with an appropriate key size.",
    "recommendation": "Change the code to use a stronger encryption algorithm and an appropriate key size, such as `AES-256` with a 256-bit key or `AES-128` with a 128-bit key."
