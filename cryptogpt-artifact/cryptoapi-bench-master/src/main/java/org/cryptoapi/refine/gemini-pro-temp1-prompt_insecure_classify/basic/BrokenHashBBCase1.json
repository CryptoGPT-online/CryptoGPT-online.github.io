    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be exploited to create fraudulent certificates or to tamper with data without being detected.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
