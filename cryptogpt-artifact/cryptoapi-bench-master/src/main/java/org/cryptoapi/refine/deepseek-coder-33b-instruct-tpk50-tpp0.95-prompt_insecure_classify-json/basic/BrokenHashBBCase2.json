### False Positive Misuse

The false positives could be the misuses related to the MD5 algorithm, they are not valid as MD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function but it's also known as broken and unsuitable for further use. The code is using it as a cryptographic hash function which is not recommended for a real-world usage.
