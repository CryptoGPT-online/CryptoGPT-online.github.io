### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "go",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` object is instantiated and the seed is set to a non-random value (`seed`). This makes the generated random numbers predictable, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this, the seed should be generated using a secure random number generator."
