[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-547: Bad URL Deserialization",
    "vulnerable_method": "URL cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "description": "Deserializing untrusted data from a URL can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can send a specially crafted URL that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a trusted source for the URL, such as a constant or a hard-coded value."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "description": "The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm can lead to vulnerabilities. In this case, the algorithm used is JKS, which is a legacy algorithm that is no longer considered secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-256: Plaintext Key Storage",
    "vulnerable_method": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
    "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "Storing cryptographic keys in plaintext increases the risk of unauthorized access and key compromise. Using static or hardcoded keys reduces the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a secure key management system or a hardware security module (HSM) to store cryptographic keys. Additionally, keys should be rotated regularly to limit the impact of key compromise."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-547: Unprotected Key Transport",
    "vulnerable_method": "URL cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "vulnerable_code": "URL cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "description": "Transmitting cryptographic keys over an insecure channel increases the risk of interception and key compromise. Sending keys over public networks or unencrypted channels can allow attackers to eavesdrop and obtain the keys.",
    "recommendation": "Encrypt or protect cryptographic keys during transmission to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Consider using secure protocols such as TLS or SSH for key transport."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-756: Use of Weak or Insecure Cipher",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "description": "Using a weak or insecure cipher algorithm can compromise the confidentiality or integrity of encrypted data. The choice of cipher should consider factors such as key size, algorithm strength, and resistance to cryptanalysis.",
    "recommendation": "Select a strong and secure cipher algorithm that is appropriate for the specific application and data sensitivity. Consider using industry-standard and well-tested algorithms such as AES, RSA, or ECC."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-650: Use of Hard-coded Password or Key",
    "vulnerable_method": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
    "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "Using a hard-coded password or key in 'defaultKey' variable is insecure. An attacker can easily obtain this password or key and use it to access the keystore.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure method to generate and store the password or key, such as using a keystore or a password manager."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "description": "Using the default KeyStore type, 'JKS', may not provide adequate encryption strength. An attacker may be able to brute-force the password and access the keystore.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger keystore type, such as 'PKCS12' or 'BKS', which provide better encryption algorithms and key lengths."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "description": "Using a potentially broken crypto algorithm named 'JKS'. JKS is known to be vulnerable to various attacks, including padding oracle attacks and BEAST attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure key store implementation, such as PKCS12 or Bouncy Castle."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "Insecure Use of Crypto API",
    "vulnerable_method": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), defaultKey.toCharArray());",
    "description": "Loading a key store from a URL using the default password 'changeit'. This is insecure because the default password is well-known and easily guessable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unique password to protect the key store. Alternatively, consider using a key store provider that supports more secure authentication mechanisms, such as PKCS12."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "Using Hardcoded Key",
    "vulnerable_method": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
    "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "This code uses a hardcoded key, \"changeit\", which is not secure and could be easily guessed by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong, unique key using a secure random number generator or a key management service."
