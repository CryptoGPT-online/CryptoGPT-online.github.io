    "description": "Using the `Blowfish` algorithm for encryption is considered insecure due to its weak key size and susceptibility to brute-force attacks. It is recommended to use more secure and modern algorithms like `AES` with a key size of at least 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Replace `Blowfish` with a stronger encryption algorithm, such as `AES-256`, and ensure that the key size is sufficient to provide adequate security."
