### False Positive Misuse ###

The false positive misuse reported is actually correct and found in the provided code:

[
    {
        "misuse category": "Incorrect Use of Cipher",
        "vulnerable_method": "go() in I1 class",
        "vulnerable_code": "The same cipher object is used for both encryption and decryption",
        "description": "The same cipher object is used for both encryption and decryption. This is not recommended because it can lead to unexpected behaviors.",
        "recommendation": "Create separate cipher objects for encryption and decryption."
    },
    {
        "misuse category": "Sensitive Data Storage Without Encryption",
        "vulnerable_method": "go() in I1 class",
        "vulnerable_code": "String myMessage = new String(\"Secret Message\");\nSealedObject encryptedMessage = new SealedObject(myMessage,cipher);",
        "description": "The string to be encrypted is not encrypted before storage in a SealedObject. This can lead to potential data breaches if the SealedObject is compromised.",
        "recommendation": "Always encrypt sensitive data before storage in a SealedObject. You can use AES encryption for this purpose."
    }
]


### Optimized Misuse JSON###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Encryption Algorithm Used",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\")",
    "description": "The code is using the RSA algorithm for encryption and decryption. RSA is considered insecure due to vulnerabilities to attacks such as brute force and timing attacks. The algorithm is typically recommended for use in non-sensitive scenarios such as key exchange, digital signatures, and padding.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES for symmetric encryption or ECC/EdDSA for asymmetric encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");\nint keysize = 1024;\nkgp.initialize(keysize);",
    "description": "The key size is statically set at 1024. This is considered insecure as smaller key sizes reduce the security strength of the generated keys.",
    "recommendation": "Use a larger key size like 2048 or 4096 to ensure strong encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Cipher Mode",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, kp.getPublic());",
    "description": "The Cipher mode used for encryption is ECB mode, which is not secure and should not be used in production. It allows patterns and correlations in the encrypted data which can be exploited for crypto analysis.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure mode like CBC, GCM, CTR or OCB for encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Unprotected Private Key",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher dec = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");\ndec.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, kp.getPrivate());",
    "description": "The private key is directly used for decryption without any protection. If the private key is exposed, it can be exploited for decryption of the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key management system to protect the private key, such as Java KeyStore or a Hardware Security Module."
  }
]
```

The above JSON includes all misuses that do not correspond to false positives reported.
