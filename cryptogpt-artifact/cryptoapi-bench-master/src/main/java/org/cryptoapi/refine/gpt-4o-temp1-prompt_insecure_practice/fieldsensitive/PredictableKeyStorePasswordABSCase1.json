### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Insecure Key Management**
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `passedKey = defKey;`
   - **Reason for False Positive:** This is not genuinely a separate misuse. It just references passing a hardcoded password rather than duplicating it within a cryptographic context. The concern regarding the hardcoded password is already covered adequately by the "Hardcoded Password" misuse, and combining them as a standalone misuse could be misleading and duplicative.

```json

    {
        "misuse": "Hardcoded Password",
        "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\";",
        "description": "The code uses a hardcoded password for the key store, which can be easily extracted from the source code. This weakens the access control to the keystore.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure method to obtain the password, such as prompting the user for it at runtime or retrieving it from a secure configuration that does not expose it in the source code."
    },

        "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\"); ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), passedKey.toCharArray());",
        "description": "Using a URL with an HTTPS connection to load the keystore without validating the server's certificate can expose the application to MITM attacks if SSL/TLS is not appropriately verified.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure proper SSL/TLS validation by verifying the server certificate against a trusted CA and consider using certificate pinning."
