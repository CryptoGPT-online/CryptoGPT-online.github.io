### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "SecureRandom Misuse": The provided code correctly uses `SecureRandom` to generate a salt, which is a common and secure practice for cryptographic operations. There is no misuse in the way `SecureRandom` is used in the given context.

2. "Static Salt Value": The code correctly generates a new random salt for each instance of `C1` using `SecureRandom`. This is not a static value and is the recommended practice for generating salts.
