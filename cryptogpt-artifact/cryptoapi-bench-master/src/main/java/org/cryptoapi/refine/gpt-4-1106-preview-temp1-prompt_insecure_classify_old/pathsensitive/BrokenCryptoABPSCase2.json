### False Positive Misuse ###

The following misuse is a false positive based on the provided code:

- CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.

The code does use a conditional switch based on the `choice` variable. However, given that `choice` is set to 2 in the `main` method and is not influenced by any external or user input in the provided code, it ensures the use of `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding`. There is a potential for misuse if `choice` were less than or equal to 1, causing the less secure Blowfish to be used, but in the current context provided, `choice` is hard-coded to guarantee AES is used.
