### False Positive Misuse ###

The Java code provided does not include any cryptographic API usage; it simply includes importing the `URL` class from `java.net` package and printing a URL string to the console. No cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, hashing, or signing are being performed in the given code snippet.

Given that there are no cryptographic APIs being used, the empty misuse lists provided are correct. Since there is nothing to report, there are no false positives to identify.
