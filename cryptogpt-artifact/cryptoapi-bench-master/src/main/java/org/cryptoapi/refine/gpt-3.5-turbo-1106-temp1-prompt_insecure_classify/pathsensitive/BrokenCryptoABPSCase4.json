[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
    "description": "The code is using the \"RC2\" algorithm for encryption, which is considered to be weak and broken.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure algorithm such as AES."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using a default key size, which may have insufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a higher key size, such as 128 or 256 bits."
  },

    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\");\nif (choice > 1)\n    cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code is selecting a less secure algorithm (RC2) when the choice is greater than 1. This could lead to the use of a weaker encryption algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Always use the strongest available encryption algorithm."
