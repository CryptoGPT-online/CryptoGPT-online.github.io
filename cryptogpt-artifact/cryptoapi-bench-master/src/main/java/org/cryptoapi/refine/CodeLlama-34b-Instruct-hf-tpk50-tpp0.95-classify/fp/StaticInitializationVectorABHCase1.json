---misuses lists end---

The following misuses were removed from the list because they are not applicable:

* CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength (the provided code does not specify the key size)
* CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (the provided code uses a random initialization vector for encryption)
* CWE-757 (for AES): The provided code uses AES in GCM mode, which is a secure mode of operation.
* CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials (the provided code does not use any hardcoded credentials)

The resulting JSON file contains only the misuses that are relevant to the provided code.
