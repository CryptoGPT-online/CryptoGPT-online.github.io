The reported misuse in the given code does appear to be a false positive. In Java, the "MessageDigest.getInstance()" method takes as its argument a string representing the cryptographic algorithm to use. The string "MD4" is a valid argument for this method. If you attempt to use an unsupported algorithm, such as "MD4", it will throw a NoSuchAlgorithmException. So the code is using the MD4 hashing algorithm correctly, it is not a misuse. 

Therefore, the provided misuses are false positives. There are no vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet.
