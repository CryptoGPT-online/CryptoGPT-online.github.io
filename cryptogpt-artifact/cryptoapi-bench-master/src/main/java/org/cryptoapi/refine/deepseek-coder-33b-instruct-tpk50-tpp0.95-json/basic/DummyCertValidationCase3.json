        "description": "The checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are not implementing any certificate validation logic, which can lead to potential security issues such as man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement certificate validation logic in the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods, using a standard algorithm or custom logic that aligns with your security requirements."
    }
