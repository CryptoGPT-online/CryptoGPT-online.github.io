### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse related to "Insufficient Key Size" is a false positive. The code `DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray()` is not related to key size but rather to the conversion of a string to a character array. The misuse seems to be a misunderstanding of the code's intent.

2. The misuse related to "Use of Potentially Dangerous Function" is a false positive in the context of this code. While it is true that `str.getBytes()` should specify a charset to ensure consistent behavior across platforms, the misuse is reported in the context of key size, which is not applicable here.
