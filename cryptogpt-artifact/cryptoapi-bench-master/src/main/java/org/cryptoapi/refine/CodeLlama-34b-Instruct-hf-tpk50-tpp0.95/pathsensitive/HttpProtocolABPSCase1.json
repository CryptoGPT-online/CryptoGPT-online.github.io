 ### False Positive Misuses

The following misuses are not applicable in the given code snippet:

1. Insufficient Key Size: The key size is not a problem in the code snippet as there is no usage of any cryptographic algorithm.
2. Insecure Randomness: The variable "choice" is not used for any cryptographic purposes, hence it is not a security vulnerability.
3. Insecure Random Number Generation: The use of `Random` class is not a security vulnerability as it is not being used for any cryptographic purposes.
4. Insecure Use of Crypto API: The code snippet is not using any crypto API, hence it is not applicable.
