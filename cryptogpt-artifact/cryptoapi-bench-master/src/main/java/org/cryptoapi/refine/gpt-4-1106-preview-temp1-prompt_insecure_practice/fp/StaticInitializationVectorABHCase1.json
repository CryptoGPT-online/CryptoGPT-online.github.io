### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Potential Use of ECB Mode" is a false positive because the code explicitly specifies "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" for the cipher instance. There is no indication that the provider would fall back to ECB mode if CBC is not supported.
2. "CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt" is a false positive because the provided code snippet does not involve any hashing operations, so this misuse is not applicable to the current context.
3. "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)" is a false positive in this context because the KeyGenerator does not explicitly require a SecureRandom instance for key generation, and the default is typically secure. However, it is good practice to specify a SecureRandom instance for key generation.
