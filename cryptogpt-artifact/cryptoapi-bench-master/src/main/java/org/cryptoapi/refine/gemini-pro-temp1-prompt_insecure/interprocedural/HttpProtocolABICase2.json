### False Positive Misuses ###

**Insufficient Entropy:** 
- Vulnerable Code: `URL = DEFAULT_URL.toCharArray();` 
- Vulnerable Code: `url = URL;` 

**Explanation:** These two misuses are false positives because the `URL` and `url` variables are not used for encryption purposes in the provided code. They are simply used to store the URL as a character array.

    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url.toString())",
    "description": "The code uses the URL constructor without specifying a URLStreamHandler or a URLConnection, which means that it will use the default URLStreamHandler and URLConnection implementations. These default implementations may not perform proper certificate validation, leaving the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Consider explicitly specifying a URLStreamHandler or a URLConnection that enforces proper certificate validation."
