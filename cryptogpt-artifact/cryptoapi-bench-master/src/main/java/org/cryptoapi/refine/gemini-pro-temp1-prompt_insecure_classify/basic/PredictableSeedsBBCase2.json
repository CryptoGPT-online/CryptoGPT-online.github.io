  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The code uses a constant value (100) to initialize the seed for the SecureRandom generator. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and easy to guess, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and initialize it with a truly random seed. The SecureRandom class provides several methods for generating random seeds, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a hardware-based random number generator (RNG) for even stronger randomness."
