        "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
        "description": "The IV is derived from a user-controlled String and its bytes. This can lead to predictable IVs, which compromises the security of the encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random generator to create a random IV, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().nextBytes()."
