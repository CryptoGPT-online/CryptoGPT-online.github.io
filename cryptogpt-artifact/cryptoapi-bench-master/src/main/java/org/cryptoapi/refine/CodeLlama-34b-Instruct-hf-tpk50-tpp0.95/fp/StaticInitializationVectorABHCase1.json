### False Positive Misuse JSON
```markdown
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
"description": "The use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. The PKCS5Padding scheme can be exploited by an attacker to decrypt the ciphertext. It's recommended to use a secure padding scheme such as AES/GCM/NoPadding or AES/CCM/NoPadding.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding with a secure padding scheme such as AES/GCM/NoPadding or AES/CCM/NoPadding."
}
```

### Explanation
The false positive misuse is not applicable because the code does not use the AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm in a way that is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. In particular, the code does not use the PKCS5Padding scheme, which is the scheme that is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Instead, the code uses AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding in combination with a secure mode of operation (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding+PBKDF2) which is not vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.

The optimized misuse JSON contains only the misuses that are applicable to the given code. The misuse of weak key generation is applicable because the code uses AES key generation without setting the key size, which can result in the use of a weak key. The misuse of insecure IV generation is applicable because the code uses a fixed IV, which can be easily guessed by an attacker and can result in a security vulnerability.
