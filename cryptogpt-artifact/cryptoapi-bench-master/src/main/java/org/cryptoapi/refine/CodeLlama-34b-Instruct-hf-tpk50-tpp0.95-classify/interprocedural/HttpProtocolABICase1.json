 ### False Positive Misuses

The following misuses are not applicable and can be removed from the misuses list:

1. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
	* The misuse is not applicable because the hardcoded URL is not a credential.
2. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* The misuse is not applicable because the `URL` class is not a cryptographic algorithm and does not have any security vulnerabilities related to cryptography.

### Optimized Misuse JSON

The following misuses are applicable and should be kept in the misuses list:

1. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
	* The misuse is applicable because the `URL` constructor with a string parameter can lead to algorithm downgrade attacks.

The optimized misuses list should include the following misuses:

[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "URL(url)",
        "description": "The method 'go()' uses the 'URL' constructor with a string parameter, which can lead to algorithm downgrade attacks. The attacker can specify a weaker algorithm in the URL, which will be used in the negotiation.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm for URL negotiation, such as 'https'."
    }
]

The misuses list has been optimized to only include the applicable misuses. The false positive misuses have been removed, and the optimized misuses list includes the applicable misuse of CWE-757.
