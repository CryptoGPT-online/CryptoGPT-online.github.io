 ### False Positive Misuse JSON

[
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The provided code uses a predictable seed for the SecureRandom object, which can be easily guessed and lead to a predictable random number sequence.",
"recommendation": "Use a truly random seed, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed(int numBytes) or a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) like the Salsa20 stream cipher."

### Optimized Misuse JSON

"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nbyte [] bytes = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};\nsr.setSeed(bytes);\nint v = sr.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println(v);",
"description": "The use of a fixed seed for a pseudorandom number generator can lead to predictability and repeatability of the generated numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a truly random seed for the SecureRandom class, such as from a hardware random number generator, to ensure the generated numbers are unpredictable and unbiased."
