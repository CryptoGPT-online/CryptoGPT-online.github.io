### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Insecure Trust Management" that refers to loading a KeyStore from "https://www.google.com" is a false positive. The URL is used as a placeholder and does not represent an actual trust management issue. However, loading a KeyStore from a remote location is not a recommended practice, and the URL should be replaced with a secure and trusted source.

2. The misuse "Insecure Transport" is also a false positive for the same reason as above. The URL "https://www.google.com" is not a legitimate certificate authority resource, but it's used as a placeholder in the code.

3. The misuse "Insecure Trust Anchor" is a false positive because the code is not actually loading a KeyStore from an HTTP URL. The URL provided is an HTTPS URL, which is secure, but it's still a placeholder and not a real KeyStore source.

        "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\";",
        "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded into the source code, which makes it easier to extract and compromise by an attacker.",

        "vulnerable_code": "\"passedKey = defKey;\"",
        "description": "The parameter 'passedKey' is immediately overwritten with 'defKey', which makes the parameter useless and the method misleading. This could lead to security misconfigurations if the method is improperly used.",

    }
]
```

Note: The misuse related to loading a KeyStore from a hardcoded URL has been omitted from the optimized list as it is a false positive due to the URL being a placeholder. However, it is important to replace the placeholder with a secure and trusted source in the actual implementation to avoid security risks.
