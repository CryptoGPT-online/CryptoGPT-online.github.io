 False Positive Misuses:

[
  {
    "misuse": "Inappropriate use of MalformedURLException",
    "vulnerable_code": "throws MalformedURLException",
    "description": "MalformedURLException is thrown if the URL provided is incorrect. However, this might not always be the case when it's simply about creating a URL object. Using MalformedURLException in this scenario might hide potential errors.",
    "recommendation": "Be sure to understand the needs of your code before using MalformedURLException and consider whether it's necessary to catch and handle the exception."
  }
]

 Optimized Misuse JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "URL Handling Misuse",
    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1(String passedURL)",
    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(passedURL)",
    "description": "If the passedURL is controlled by an attacker, they could potentially cause a malformed URL exception. This could potentially be used to execute a denial-of-service attack.",
    "recommendation": "You should validate the URL before using it. You can use URL.toURI() method to verify it. Make sure to handle MalformedURLException properly."
  }
]
```

Please note that the misuses that have been marked as false positives are removed as they are not directly related to creating a URL object. The rest of the misuses are still valid and should be fixed.
