### False Positive Misuse
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C4(\"MD2\");",
        "description": "The use of 'MD2' as a cryptographic algorithm is known to be insecure. It is not resistant to many different attacks and should not be used in a secure context.",
        "recommendation": "You should not use 'MD2' for any cryptographic operation as it is considered broken. Consider using a strong, secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or a modern hashing algorithm like BLAKE2."

### Optimized Misuse JSON
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The code uses the cryptographic hashing function MD2. This algorithm is considered weak, and has been proven to be vulnerable to a number of attacks. Attackers can generate hash collisions and may be able to forge messages.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use stronger algorithms such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. Additionally, it is advisable to switch to a keyed message authentication code (HMAC), as it provides similar security properties while being more secure against some types of attacks."
