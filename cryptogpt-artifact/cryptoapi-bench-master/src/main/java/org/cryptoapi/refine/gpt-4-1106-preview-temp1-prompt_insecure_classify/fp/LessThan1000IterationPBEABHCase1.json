### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (List 1)
   - The salt is properly generated using `SecureRandom` which is a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. The misuse report indicates concern over salt reuse, but the code provided generates a new salt for each execution, hence there's no indication of salt being reused. This is a false positive.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (List 5)
   - As explained above, the salt is adequately random, and the value "20" is not the salt but the iteration count. The explanation does not correctly describe the provided code.

3. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (List 4)
   - The recommendation references hardcoding cryptographic values which are not demonstrated in the vulnerable code line provided. The misuse here seems to be referring to a key or other sensitive value whereas the code is discussing iteration count for PBEParameterSpec, which is correctly implemented.
