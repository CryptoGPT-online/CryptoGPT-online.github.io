### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Static IV/Seed" - This misuse is not applicable to the provided code since RSA does not use an IV in the same way symmetric ciphers do. The code does not involve block cipher modes like ECB or CBC that would require an IV.
2. "String Initialization" - While it is a security best practice to avoid using immutable `String` objects for sensitive data, this is not a cryptographic API misuse per se. It is more of a general security recommendation.
