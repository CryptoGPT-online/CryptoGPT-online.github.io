```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C6(\"IDEA\");",
        "description": "The IDEA algorithm is considered deprecated and not recommended for use in modern cryptographic applications due to its susceptibility to certain cryptanalytic attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a sufficient key length (e.g., AES-256)."

        "description": "The key generation process does not specify a secure random number generator, which may lead to predictability in key generation.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the use of a secure random number generator by using keyGen.init(keySize, new SecureRandom()) to explicitly set a SecureRandom instance."
