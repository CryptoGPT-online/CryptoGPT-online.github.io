### False Positive Misuse ###
The following misuses are false positives:

- CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

This misuse is not applicable because the code does not use any cryptographic algorithms.

  {
    "misuse category": "Weak Seed Generation (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_method": "C2.<init>",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;\ncrypto = new C2(seed);",
    "description": "The seed used for the SecureRandom instance is fixed to a constant value (100), which makes it predictable and easy to guess.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator to generate a truly random seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a more secure PRNG algorithm, such as ChaCha20 or Fortuna."

    "misuse category": "Insecure Randomness (CWE-338)",
    "vulnerable_method": "C2.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is initialized with a single byte array as the seed, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. An attacker could potentially guess or manipulate the seed value, compromising the security of the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to generate random numbers, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` or `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")`. These methods use a combination of entropy sources to generate unpredictable and secure random numbers."
