 Here is the optimized misuse JSON file with the false positive misuses removed:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
        "description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is not truly random and can be easily predicted by an attacker.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as /dev/urandom, to generate a truly random seed for the SecureRandom instance."
    }
]
```
In this optimized misuse JSON file, the false positive misuses are removed, and only the truly vulnerable misuses are reported.
