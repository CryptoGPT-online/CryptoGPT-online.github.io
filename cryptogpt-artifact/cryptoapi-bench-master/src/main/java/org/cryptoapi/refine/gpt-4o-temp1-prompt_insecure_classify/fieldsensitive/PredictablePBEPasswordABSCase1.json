### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `int keyLength = 16;`
   - **Reason**: This is a misleading report. The `keyLength` value of `16` in the code is measured in bytes, not bits. Therefore, a `keyLength` of `16` bytes equates to `128` bits, which is a standard and secure key length for some cryptographic algorithms such as AES. Given this context, the report of inadequate encryption strength is a false positive in terms of key length specification.
