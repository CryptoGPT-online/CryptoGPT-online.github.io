 Here is the list of misuses with the false positives removed and the list of misuses optimized for the JSON format:

False Positive Misuses:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* The misuse is reported for the line "String.valueOf(crypto)", but the vulnerable code is actually "CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray()".
2. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
	* The misuse is reported for the line "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))", but the vulnerable code is actually "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))".

Optimized Misuses:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray()",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm 'IDEA' is considered insecure and should not be used. A more secure algorithm such as AES should be used instead.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'IDEA' with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm 'IDEA' is considered insecure and should not be used. A more secure algorithm such as AES should be used instead.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'IDEA' with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm 'IDEA' is considered insecure and should not be used. A more secure algorithm such as AES should be used instead.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'IDEA' with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm 'IDEA' is considered insecure and should not be used. A more secure algorithm such as AES should be used instead.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'IDEA' with a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES."
    }
]
```
Note that the first two misuses are for the same vulnerability, and the third misuse is for a different vulnerability.
