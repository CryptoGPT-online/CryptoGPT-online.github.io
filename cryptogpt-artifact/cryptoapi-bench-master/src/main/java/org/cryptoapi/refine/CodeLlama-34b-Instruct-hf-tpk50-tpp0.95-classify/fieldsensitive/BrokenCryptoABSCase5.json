 ### False Positive Misuse ###

The first misuse reported is a potential use of the broken IDEA algorithm. However, this is not a false positive, as the code does use the IDEA algorithm. The recommendation to replace it with a stronger algorithm is appropriate.

The second misuse reported is a potential use of the getBytes() method with a string that is not properly encoded. However, the code does not actually use the getBytes() method, so this is a false positive.

The third misuse reported is a potential use of the IDEA algorithm as the default encryption algorithm. However, this is not a false positive, as the code does set the default encryption algorithm to IDEA. The recommendation to change the default encryption algorithm to a stronger and more modern one is appropriate.
