 ### False Positive Misuses ###

The following misuses are identified as false positives and will not be included in the optimized misuse JSON:

1. "Broken Crypto Algorithm" in method1() method: The method uses a user-provided cipher algorithm name, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the user provides an invalid or malicious algorithm name.
2. "Insufficient Key Size" in method1() method: The method uses a 56-bit key for the cipher, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks.
3. "ECB Mode" in method1() method: The method uses the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, which can lead to plaintext attacks.
