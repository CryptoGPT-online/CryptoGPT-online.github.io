    "description": "The use of the 'RC4' algorithm is considered risky and outdated. RC4 does not have key size parameters and is vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks. It's considered broken and no longer recommended for use.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure algorithm such as AES, RSA, or a mode of operation on AES like AES/GCM/NoPadding. Also, make sure to use secure keys with a sufficient length for the chosen algorithm."
