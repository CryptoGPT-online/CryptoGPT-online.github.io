### False Positive Misuse ###
The reported misuses can be false positives for a couple of reasons. The first is the use of DES in the Cipher.getInstance() method even though there is a condition that could switch to AES if `choice > 1`. The second misuse about AES key strength only arises if the developer decides to generate it rather than receiving one from a trusted source.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

The false positives have been removed and the optimized misuse list is shown below:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");\nif (choice > 1)\n    cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "The choice of the encryption algorithm depends on a variable parameter (`choice`). It doesn't seem to be checked in any security-sensitive context, which could lead to the use of a less secure algorithm than initially intended.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this, you should validate `choice` to ensure it aligns with your intended use of encryption algorithms."
    }
]
```
