### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Improper Call to KeyGenerator.getInstance**
   - The report suggests that using a variable for `getInstance` is insecure because it could lead to an uncontrolled configuration if the input is not validated. In this case, the program defines a controlled string `"DES"` and uses it throughout the code, making this a false positive in the current context. There is no external input manipulation, and the input is not dynamic in reality.
