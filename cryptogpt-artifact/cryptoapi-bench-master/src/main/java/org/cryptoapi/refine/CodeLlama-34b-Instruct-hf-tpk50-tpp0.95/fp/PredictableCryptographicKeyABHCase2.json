 ### False Positive Misuse JSON

{
"misuse": "Insecure Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
"description": "The key size is set to 16 bytes, which is too small for the AES algorithm. The key size should be at least 256 bits.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key size, such as 256 bits, to improve the security of the encryption."

"misuse": "Crypto API Misuse",
"vulnerable_code": "Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16)",
"description": "The code uses a hardcoded length for the key, which can cause the key to be truncated or padded with random data, potentially leading to decryption errors or data tampering.",

"misuse": "Insecure Key Derivation",
"vulnerable_code": "key.getBytes()",
"description": "The code uses the getBytes() method to convert the key to a byte array, which can cause the key to be encoded in a platform-specific way, potentially leading to interoperability issues.",

"description": "The AES algorithm is being used in ECB mode, which is not secure. ECB mode does not provide semantic security, meaning that if the same block is encrypted twice, the resulting ciphertext blocks will be the same.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cipher mode, such as CBC or GCM mode, to provide both confidentiality and integrity."
