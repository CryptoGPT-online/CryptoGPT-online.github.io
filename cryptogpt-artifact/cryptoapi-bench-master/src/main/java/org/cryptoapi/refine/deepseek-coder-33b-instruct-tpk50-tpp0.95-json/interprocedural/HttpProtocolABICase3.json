[
  {
    "misuse category": "Insecure Use of URL",
    "vulnerable_method": "method2(String url) throws MalformedURLException",
    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
    "description": "Constructing a URL object from user-provided input without proper sanitization can lead to code injection attacks. For instance, if a user were to input a specially crafted URL, they could potentially redirect the application to a malicious site.",
    "recommendation": "Validate and sanitize all user-provided input when constructing URL objects. Use a whitelist approach to only allow URLs with expected structures."

    "misuse category": "Improper input validation",
    "vulnerable_method": "method2(String url) throws MalformedURLException",
    "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
    "description": "The URL is constructed from an untrusted source without any form of input validation. If a malicious user provides input, they could potentially exploit this to create an incorrect URL object, leading to a Denial of Service attack.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a whitelist or blacklist based approach to validate the input URL. Additionally, any URLs used in system calls should be encoded to prevent command injection attacks."
