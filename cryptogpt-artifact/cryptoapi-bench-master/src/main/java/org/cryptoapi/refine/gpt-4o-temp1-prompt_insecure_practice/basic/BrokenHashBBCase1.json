### False Positive Misuse ###

There are no false positive misuses in this scenario. The misuse identified across all reports pertains to the use of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which is indeed insecure and poses a known risk due to vulnerability to collision attacks. Recommendations to use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 are valid and applicable.
