### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse of "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" is determined to be a false positive in this context. From the code, it is evident that the strings stored in the `hm` Map are placeholders or non-sensitive fixed values used for demonstration purposes. The value "afix" in `hm.put("aaa", "afix");` does not appear to be a credential or any sensitive information. Therefore, this misuse can be removed from the list.
