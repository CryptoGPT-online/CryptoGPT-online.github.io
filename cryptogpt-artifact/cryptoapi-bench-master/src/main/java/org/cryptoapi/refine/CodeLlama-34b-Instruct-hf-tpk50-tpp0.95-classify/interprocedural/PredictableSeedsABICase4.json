 ### False Positive Misuse JSON

* CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
	+ The misuse report claims that the variable `seed` is assigned the value of `SEED`, which is a constant string with a low entropy. However, the code only uses the `SEED` constant once to generate a `SecureRandom` instance, which is not vulnerable to a predictable seed.

* CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
	+ The misuse report claims that the method `Byte.parseByte(String)` is used to convert a string to a byte value, which can be used as a seed for the `SecureRandom` instance. However, the code only uses the `Byte.parseByte(String)` method once to convert the fixed seed "100" to a byte value, which is not vulnerable to a small number of possible seeds.

* CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
	+ The misuse report claims that the method `SecureRandom` is used with a static seed, which can lead to predictable random numbers. However, the code only uses the `SecureRandom` class with a fixed seed of "100", which is not vulnerable to a birthday attack as it is a constant value.
