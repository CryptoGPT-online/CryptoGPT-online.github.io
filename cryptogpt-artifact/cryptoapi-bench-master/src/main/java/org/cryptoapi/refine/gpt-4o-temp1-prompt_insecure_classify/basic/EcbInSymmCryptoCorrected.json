### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.**  
   - **Reason:** The code indeed generates a secret key dynamically but doesn't involve any hardcoded credentials. The misuse description incorrectly identifies the dynamic key generation as hardcoded credentials. Instead, it highlights a point regarding secure key management, which is peripheral to the CWE-798 category.
