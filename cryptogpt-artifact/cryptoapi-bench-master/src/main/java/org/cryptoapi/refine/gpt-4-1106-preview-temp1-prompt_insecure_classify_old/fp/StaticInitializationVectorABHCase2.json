The provided code and the misuse reports seem to be consistent with each other. The misuse reports correctly identify two main issues:

1. The use of a non-random, predictable value for the initialization vector (IV).
2. The lack of specification for the AES key size, which could result in a weaker encryption key if the default is not adequate.

Here is the renewed list of real cryptographic API misuse based on the provided code and misuse reports:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
        "description": "The IV (Initialization Vector) is created from a string 'str' which is retrieved from a predefined map, hence it is not random and can be predictable. This compromises the security of the encryption in CBC mode.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random generator like SecureRandom to create a random IV for each encryption operation."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
        "description": "The key generator does not specify the key size for the AES algorithm. If the default key size used by the JCE provider is less than 256 bits, it may not provide strong enough security.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly when generating the AES key by using keyGen.init(256); to ensure a key size of 256 bits."
    }
]
```

The renewed list maintains the original issues but clarifies the descriptions and recommendations. It is important to note that the default key size for AES in Java is 128 bits, which is generally considered secure, but specifying a key size of 256 bits is recommended for higher security requirements. Additionally, the IV should always be randomly generated for each encryption operation to ensure the security of the cipher in CBC mode.
