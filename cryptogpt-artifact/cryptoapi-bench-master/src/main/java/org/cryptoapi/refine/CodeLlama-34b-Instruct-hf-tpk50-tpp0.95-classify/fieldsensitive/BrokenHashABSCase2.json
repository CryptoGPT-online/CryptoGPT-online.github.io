 Here is the optimized list of misuses:

[
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new C2(\"MD5\")",
"description": "The code uses MD5 as the default cryptographic algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purpose.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-2 or Bcrypt."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "passedAlgo.isEmpty() ? crypto : passedAlgo",
"description": "The code allows the user to specify a cryptographic algorithm, but does not validate the input. This can lead to the use of a broken or risky algorithm, such as MD5.",
"recommendation": "Validate the user-specified algorithm against a list of known secure algorithms, and provide an error message if an invalid algorithm is specified."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(md.digest());",
"description": "The code prints the digest of the input string, which is a cryptographic operation. However, the digest is not encrypted, and therefore can be easily accessed by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Encrypt the digest before printing it out."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The MessageDigest class is not intended to be used for certificate validation. It is used to generate a message digest, not to validate a certificate.",
"recommendation": "Use a different class, such as the CertificateFactory class, to validate certificates."
