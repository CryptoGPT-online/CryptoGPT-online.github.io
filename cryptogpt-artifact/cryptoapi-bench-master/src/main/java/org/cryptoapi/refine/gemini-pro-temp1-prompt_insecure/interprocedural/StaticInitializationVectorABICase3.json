  {
    "misuse category": "Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses the default key size for AES, which is 128 bits. This key size is considered insecure by modern standards.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as 256 bits, by passing an appropriate argument to `KeyGenerator.generateKey()`."

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses the CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. An attacker can use this vulnerability to decrypt the ciphertext without knowing the encryption key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as GCM or EAX, instead of CBC."

    "description": "The code uses the default KeyGenerator to generate a key, which is not secure. An attacker can use this vulnerability to predict the encryption key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the key."
