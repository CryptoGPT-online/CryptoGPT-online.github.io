 ## False Positive Misuses

The following misuses are false positives:

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
	* Vulnerable Code: `ENCRYPT_KEY = DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY.toCharArray();`
	* Description: The encryption key is not generated randomly and can be easily guessed.
	* Recommendation: Use a random value for the encryption key and consider implementing a secure key management system.

This misuse is a false positive because the encryption key is generated randomly from the default encryption key, which is a constant value that is not easily guessed.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
	* Vulnerable Code: `String type = "JKS";`
	* Description: The encryption strength is not adequate and can be easily broken.
	* Recommendation: Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-256, and consider implementing SSL/TLS to protect the communication.

This misuse is a false positive because the JKS algorithm is used for key storage and management, which is not considered insecure.

## Optimized Misuse JSON

The following misuses are optimized based on the false positive misuses:

1. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
	* Vulnerable Code: `ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), encryptKey);`
	* Description: The algorithm used to load the CA certificates is not secure and can be exploited.
	* Recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm, such as Bouncy Castle, to load the CA certificates.
2. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
	* Vulnerable Code: `DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY = "changeit"`
	* Description: The encryption key is hardcoded in the code, which makes it vulnerable to attackers who can access the source code or the compiled binary.
	* Recommendation: Use a secure method to store and manage encryption keys, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a secure storage solution like AWS KMS.
