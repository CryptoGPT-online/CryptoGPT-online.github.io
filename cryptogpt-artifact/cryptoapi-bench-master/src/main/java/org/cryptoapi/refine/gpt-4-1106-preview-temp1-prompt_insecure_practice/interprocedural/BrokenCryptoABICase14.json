### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Insecure Randomness" and "Use of Default SecureRandom" are false positives because the code does not show any explicit use of `SecureRandom`. The `KeyGenerator` class uses a default secure random source, and without evidence of a weak implementation, we cannot assume insecurity.
2. "Insufficient Entropy in Key Generation" is a false positive because there is no indication that the default entropy is insufficient. The `KeyGenerator` is designed to use a secure source of randomness unless configured otherwise.
3. "Hardcoded Crypto Algorithm" is a false positive in this context because the algorithm is passed as a parameter to the methods, and it's not hardcoded within the cryptographic operation methods (`method1` and `method2`). The string "RC2" is indeed hardcoded in the `main` method, but this is likely for example purposes.
