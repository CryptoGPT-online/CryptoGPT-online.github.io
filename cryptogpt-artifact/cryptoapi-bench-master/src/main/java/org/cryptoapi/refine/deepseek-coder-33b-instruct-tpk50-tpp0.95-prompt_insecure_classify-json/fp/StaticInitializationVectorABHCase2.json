## False Positive Misuse 

This list of cryptographic API misuses does not contain any false positives. All issues that appear to be potential security vulnerabilities are indeed misuses of the Java cryptographic APIs.

        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a secure IV of at least 128 bits. For example, SecureRandom can be used as follows: `SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom(); byte[] iv = new byte[16]; secureRandom.nextBytes(iv);`"

        "description": "The use of the AES encryption algorithm with a block cipher mode of operation (CBC) and PKCS5 padding is generally recommended only if the data to be encrypted is less than a block (16 bytes) in length.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM or AES-CCM, or, even better, an authenticated encryption scheme with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme (AEAD)."
