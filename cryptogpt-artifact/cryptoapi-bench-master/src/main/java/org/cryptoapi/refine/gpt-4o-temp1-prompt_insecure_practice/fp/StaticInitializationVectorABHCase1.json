### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - This misuse was inaccurately cataloged under a separate case that had already identified the use of a hardcoded initialization vector (IV). The usage of "abcde" is recognized for its role as a predictable IV rather than as a key misuse in the context of this code.
