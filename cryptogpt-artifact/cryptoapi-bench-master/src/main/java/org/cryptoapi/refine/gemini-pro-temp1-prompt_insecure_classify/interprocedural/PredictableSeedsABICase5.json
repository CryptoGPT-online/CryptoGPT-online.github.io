{
 "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
 "vulnerable_method": "method1",
 "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
 "description": "The seed value for `SecureRandom` is not sufficiently random. It is generated using a fixed sequence of bytes, which can be easily predicted by an attacker.",
 "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to generate the seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. This method generates a seed that is cryptographically secure."
