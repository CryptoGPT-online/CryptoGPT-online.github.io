  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "Ld.key2()",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code generates a 32-byte salt using `SecureRandom`. This is not sufficient to protect against brute-force attacks. When using AES-256, the salt should be at least 16 bytes long.",
    "recommendation": "Use a larger salt size, such as 64 bytes."
  },

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "Ld.key2()",
    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
    "description": "The number of iterations used for key derivation is too low, which makes the encryption weaker.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to at least 10,000."
