[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "java.security.SecureRandom.setSeed",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed seed to initialize the `SecureRandom` object. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and not truly random, which can compromise the security of applications that rely on random values, such as cryptographic algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, avoid using a fixed seed for `SecureRandom`. Instead, use a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG) such as `java.security.SecureRandom` and initialize it with a non-deterministic entropy source, such as `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems or `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows."
