] False Positive Misuse:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (in the `Cipher.getInstance(crypto)` call)
	* The `crypto` parameter is passed as a user-provided string, which allows an attacker to specify a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm.
	* The `Cipher` class will use the provided algorithm, even if it is weak or broken.
	* To fix this misuse, the user-provided input should be validated and sanitized to ensure that only strong and secure cryptographic algorithms are used.

Note: The first misuse (CWE-327) was a false positive, as the `Cipher` class will use the provided algorithm, even if it is weak or broken. Therefore, the misuse was not applicable in this case. {
