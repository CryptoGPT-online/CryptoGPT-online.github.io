[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\");",
    "description": "The code uses the IDEA cipher, which is considered insecure and should not be used for encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher such as AES or ChaCha20."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "if (choice > 1)\n            cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code dynamically selects the cipher algorithm based on the value of the 'choice' variable, which could potentially allow an attacker to choose a less secure cipher.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305, and avoid allowing the user to select the cipher algorithm."
