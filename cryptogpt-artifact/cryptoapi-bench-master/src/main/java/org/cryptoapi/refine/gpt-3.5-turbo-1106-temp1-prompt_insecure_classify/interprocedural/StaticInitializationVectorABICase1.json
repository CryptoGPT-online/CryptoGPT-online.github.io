[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code is generating a random AES key with the default key size, which may not provide sufficient encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a specific key size or use a more secure key generation algorithm, such as RSA."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
    "description": "The IV used in AES/CBC mode should be a random and unpredictable value. Using a static byte array as the IV reduces the effective security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV using a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": " Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding. CBC mode with PKCS5Padding is considered to be a risky cryptographic algorithm because it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks and has other security issues. It is recommended to use AES with GCM mode for better security.",
    "recommendation": "Use AES/GCM/NoPadding instead of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding."
