The provided JSON has several false positives, and here are the optimized versions:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_method": "Pd.main()",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nlong l = sr.nextLong();\nsr.setSeed(l);\nint v = sr.nextInt();",
        "description": "The use of a fixed seed when generating random values makes the sequence of random values less random and hence less secure.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the line `sr.setSeed(l)`."
    }
]
```
This is a false positive because while the seed is set to a long variable, the value of this long variable itself is generated via a CSPRNG, which is good practice for seeding. The rest of the code uses the SecureRandom instance correctly for its intended purpose (producing random integers).

So, the optimized misuse list will contain only one misuse.
