  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The code is using the getBytes() method to retrieve the key as a byte array, which may result in using a weak encoding (e.g. UTF-8) and can lead to inadequate encryption strength. Additionally, the code is relying on a fixed key length of 16 bytes, which is considered weak for AES encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong encoding (e.g. UTF-8) to convert the key to bytes. Instead of relying on a fixed key length, use a secure key derivation function such as PBKDF2 to generate a key with sufficient length."
