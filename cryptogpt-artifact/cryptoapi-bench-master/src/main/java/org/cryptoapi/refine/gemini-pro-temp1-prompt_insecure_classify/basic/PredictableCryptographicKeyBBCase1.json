    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "P1.main",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The encryption key is derived from a fixed string `defaultKey`, which is weak and can be easily guessed or brute-forced.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable key for encryption. Consider using a secure random number generator to generate the key."

    "vulnerable_method": "P1.main",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();",
    "description": "Creating a SecretKeySpec with a key derived from a String is insecure, as it uses the platform's default character encoding, which may not be suitable for cryptographic purposes. Additionally, the key is not sufficiently random, as it is derived from a static password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a key. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to generate a cryptographically strong random key."
