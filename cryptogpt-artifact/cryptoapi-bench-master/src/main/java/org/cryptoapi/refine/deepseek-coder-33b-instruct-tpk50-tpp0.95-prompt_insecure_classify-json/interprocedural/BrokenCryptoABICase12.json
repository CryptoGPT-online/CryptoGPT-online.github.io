The two misuse reports given in the JSON format are true positives. Here's how to explain:

The first misuse is true as Blowfish is considered a weak cipher. 
The second misuse is true because the cryptographic algorithm used is hardcoded and not chosen dynamically according to the system's available security policy. 

After fixing these misuses, the code would look like this:

```java
public class B2 {
    private static final String SECURE_CRYPTO_ALGO = "AES";
    private static final String SYSTEM_SECURE_POLICY = "systemSecurePolicy";
    
    public static void method2(String c) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        String cryptoAlgo = System.getProperty(SYSTEM_SECURE_POLICY, SECURE_CRYPTO_ALGO);
        method1(cryptoAlgo);
    }
    
    public static void method1(String crypto) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);
        SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) throws NoSuchPaddingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
        String crypto = SECURE_CRYPTO_ALGO;
        method2(crypto);
    }
}
```
