### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Insecure Trust Management**: The code is indeed loading a KeyStore from a URL, but the URL itself ("https://www.google.com") is not the source of the KeyStore; it's just a placeholder URL and does not represent an actual KeyStore source. The misuse description assumes that the URL is used to load a KeyStore with trusted certificates, which is not evident from the provided code. Therefore, this is a false positive.

2. **Insufficient Validation of Certificate**: The code does not perform any certificate validation because it is not establishing an SSL/TLS connection where such validation would be required. It is simply opening a stream to a URL, which is not inherently a misuse. This is a false positive.

3. **Inadequate Certificate Validation**: Similar to the above point, the code is not performing SSL/TLS certificate validation because it is not establishing a secure connection that would require such validation. This is a false positive.

4. **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)**: As mentioned, the code is not involved in the process of validating SSL/TLS certificates, so this is a false positive.
