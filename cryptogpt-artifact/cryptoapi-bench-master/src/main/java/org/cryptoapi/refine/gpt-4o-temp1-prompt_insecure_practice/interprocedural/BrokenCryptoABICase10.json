### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Static Key Management**

   - **Reason**: The reported misuse about storing algorithm names in static variables does not accurately apply here. While it is generally a good practice to avoid hardcoding algorithm names or sensitive data, the current implementation does not manipulate or expose the `CRYPTO` and `crypto` variables in a manner that leads to insecure scenarios. These variables are simply used to store and pass the algorithm name initialized from the constant `DEFAULT_CRYPTO`, and its usage does not introduce a security risk unless the algorithm itself is insecure. The primary concern lies in the usage of the IDEA algorithm.
