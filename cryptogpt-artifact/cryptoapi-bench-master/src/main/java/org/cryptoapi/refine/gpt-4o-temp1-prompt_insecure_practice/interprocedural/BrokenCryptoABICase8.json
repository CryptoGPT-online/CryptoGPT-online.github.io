### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Static Key and Hardcoded Algorithm**

   - **Reason:** The issue described refers to the use of a static variable for algorithm storage (`crypto`), but it does not introduce direct misuse or security issue beyond the use of RC2 itself. While it's true that RC2 is insecure and hardcoding it is inflexible, the fact that variables could be changed internally is not inherently insecure if managed correctly.

2. **Hardcoded Cryptographic Algorithm**

   - **Reason:** The critique of using hardcoded algorithms is valid in terms of flexibility. However, it is the choice of RC2 that is truly insecureâ€”not the hardcoding practice itself. Modern best practices push for configurability, but security isn't violated merely by hardcoding unless the code needs updates to replace outdated algorithms.

        "description": "The RC2 algorithm is considered to be insecure for many cryptographic purposes due to its outdated design and vulnerability to attacks such as key recovery and plaintext recovery.",

This optimized list focuses on the actual security implications, especially the insecure choice of the cryptographic algorithm (RC2) and the dynamic method of specification, which both constitute the primary security concerns.
