 I apologize for the confusion, here is the optimized misuse JSON list based on the provided code and misuse reports:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
    "description": "The initialization vector (IV) used in the cipher is generated using the \"abcde\" string, which is not a random value and can be easily guessed. Using a fixed IV can make it easier for an attacker to break the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for each encryption operation, and store it alongside the encrypted data. This will ensure that each encryption operation uses a unique IV, making it harder for an attacker to break the encryption."
  }
]
```
The provided code uses a fixed initialization vector (IV), which is not secure. It is recommended to use a secure random number generator to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation.
