### False Positive Misuse ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The code uses MD2, which is considered a weak cryptographic algorithm due to its vulnerabilities to collision attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256."
    }
]
```
**Explanation:** The misuse flagged on `MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));` is essentially the same as those flagged on `public static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = "MD2";`. It is downstream usage of the constant defining the algorithm. The actual misuse is due to the declaration of using MD2 as the hashing algorithm, which has been addressed in the other misuse entries. This makes it a duplicate report rather than an independent misuse.
