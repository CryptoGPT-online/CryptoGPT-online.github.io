### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Missing Initialization Vector (IV)" - This is a false positive because RC4 is a stream cipher and does not use an IV in the same way block ciphers do. Therefore, the absence of an IV is not a misuse in the context of RC4.

2. "Inadequate Key Size" - This is a false positive because RC4 does not have a variable key size in the same way that AES does. The key size for RC4 is typically 128 bits, and the code does not specify the key size, which is not necessarily a misuse.

3. "Hardcoded Crypto Algorithm" - While it is generally a good practice to avoid hardcoding cryptographic algorithms, this is not a misuse per se. It is more of a design consideration for flexibility and future-proofing.

4. "Lack of Exception Handling" - This is not a cryptographic API misuse. It is a general coding practice issue and does not directly relate to the security of the cryptographic operations.
