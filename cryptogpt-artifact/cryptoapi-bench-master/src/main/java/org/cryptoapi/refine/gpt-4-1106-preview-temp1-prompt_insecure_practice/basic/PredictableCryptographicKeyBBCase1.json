### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Inadequate Key Size**: The misuse that states the key size is manually set to 16 bytes and does not allow for easy switching to larger key sizes is a false positive. The code is explicitly using AES which operates with 128, 192, or 256-bit keys. The provided code is using a 128-bit key which is a standard and secure key size for AES. However, the misuse related to the hardcoded key and its derivation is valid.

2. **Insufficient key size**: The misuse that states "If the default key is less than 128 bits (16 bytes), which is the minimum key length recommended for AES, the key is considered weak" is a false positive because the code is explicitly padding the key to 16 bytes, which is the minimum recommended length for AES.

3. **Insecure Randomness**: The misuse that mentions "The code pads the key with zeros if it's less than the required size" is a false positive because padding the key to a specific size is a common practice when dealing with keys that are shorter than the required length. However, the misuse is valid in the context that the key should not be derived from a hardcoded, low-entropy string.

4. **Use of a Default Key**: The misuse that states "The code uses a hardcoded key 'defaultkey', which is a common string" is a false positive in the context of key size, as the key is padded to the correct size for AES. However, the misuse is valid in terms of the security implications of using a hardcoded key.
