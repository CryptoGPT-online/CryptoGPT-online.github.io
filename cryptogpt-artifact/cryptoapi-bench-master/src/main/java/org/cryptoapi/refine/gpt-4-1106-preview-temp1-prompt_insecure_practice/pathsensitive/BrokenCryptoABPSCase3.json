### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "ECB Mode Allowed" is a false positive because the code does not default to ECB mode. The cipher instance is either "RC4" or "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding", and there is no instance where "AES" is used without specifying the mode.

2. The misuse "Inadequate Error Handling" is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse. While it is a good practice to use specific exceptions, this is not directly related to the security of the cryptographic operations.

3. The misuse "Insufficiently Protected Credentials" is a false positive because the code provided does not show how the key is stored or handled after generation. Without additional context, we cannot assume that the key is insufficiently protected.
