### False Positive Misuse ###
1. "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm." is false positive in this case because the code is using the `MessageDigest` class for hashing, not for encryption. `MessageDigest` is a correct usage of the MD5 algorithm for hashing, not for encryption. It doesn't actually perform encryption or decryption.

2. "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation." is also false positive since the algorithm is not selected during runtime but instead it is hardcoded.

3. "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" is also false positive in this case as no encryption is actually being performed.
