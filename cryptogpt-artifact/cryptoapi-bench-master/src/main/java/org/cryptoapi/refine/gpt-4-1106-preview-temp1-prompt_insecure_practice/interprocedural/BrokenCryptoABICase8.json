### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys" - The term `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` is misleading in the misuse description. It is not a cryptographic key but an identifier for the cryptographic algorithm. The misuse should be about the use of a weak algorithm, not hardcoded keys.

2. "Incorrect Use of APIs" - While it is true that cryptographic parameters should be handled securely, the misuse description is not accurate. The code is not using `String.valueOf(crypto)` in an insecure way to handle cryptographic parameters; it is simply converting a character array to a string to use as an algorithm identifier. The misuse should focus on the weak algorithm and not the API usage.

3. "Static Mutable Array" - The misuse description is correct in stating that static mutable arrays can be problematic, but in this context, the array is used to store the algorithm name, not sensitive cryptographic material like keys. The misuse should be about the weak algorithm and not the mutable array.

4. "Incomplete Cipher Transformation" - The misuse description is correct, but it is not a separate issue from using a weak encryption algorithm. The misuse should be combined with the weak algorithm misuse.

5. "Hardcoded Sensitive Information" - Similar to the first point, `DEFAULT_CRYPTO` is not sensitive information; it is an algorithm identifier. The misuse should be about the weak algorithm, not hardcoded sensitive information.
