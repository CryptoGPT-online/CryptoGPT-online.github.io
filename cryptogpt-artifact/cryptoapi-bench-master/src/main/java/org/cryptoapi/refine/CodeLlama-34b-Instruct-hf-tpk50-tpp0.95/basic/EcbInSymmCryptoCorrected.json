 ### False Positive Misuse JSON ###
```
{
"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "Insecure Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
"description": "The code is using AES in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which is a vulnerable configuration. CBC mode is prone to padding oracle attacks, and PKCS5 padding does not provide enough security against these attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure encryption mode such as GCM or EAX, and use a secure padding scheme such as PKCS7."
},
{
"misuse": "Misuse of KeyGenerator",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
"description": "The key generator is using the AES algorithm to generate a secret key, but the generated key is not being used securely. The key should be generated securely and stored securely.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key management system such as a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and store the key securely."
}
]
}

Note that I have removed the false positive misuses from the original list and included only the remaining misuses in the optimized misuse JSON.
