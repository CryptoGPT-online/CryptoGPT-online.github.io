### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.**
   - *Vulnerable Code:* `int keyLength = 16;`
   - *Reason:* The context shows that `keyLength` is actually intended to be in bytes, not bits. For PBEKeySpec, it's common to specify the key length in bytes, not bits. The value of 16 for a key length (128 bits) can be adequate depending on the specific algorithm being used. Therefore, it does not necessarily represent a true weakness based on how the cryptographic strength is assessed in this case.

2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.**
   - *Vulnerable Code:* `"The key length of 16 is inadequate for cryptographic operations as it only represents a 128-bit key. This may not be sufficient against modern attacks."`
   - *Reason:* Similar justification as above. While there is a general recommendation to use longer key lengths for increased security, this report misidentifies "16" as inadequate without factoring in that it's describing a 128-bit key length.
