After reviewing the provided Java code, it appears that there is no cryptographic API being used at all. The classes `H1` and `C1` are dealing with URL manipulation and printing, and there is no indication of any cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, hashing, or key generation.

The misuse lists provided are all empty, which is consistent with the code analysis since there are no cryptographic API misuses to report.

### False Positive Misuse ###
There are no false positives because there are no cryptographic API misuses reported, and the code does not contain any cryptographic operations.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
Since there are no cryptographic API misuses, the optimized misuse JSON remains empty as provided:

```json
[]
```
