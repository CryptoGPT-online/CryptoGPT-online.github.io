### Optimized Misuse JSON
None of the misuses in the list is a false positive. The code has hard-coded the crypto algorithm and uses non-default cryptographic algorithm. It violates the security principle of least privilege and potential compatibility issues between different Java versions or platforms. Please review the code carefully and use a flexible configuration to ensure only valid, approved cryptographic algorithms are used.
