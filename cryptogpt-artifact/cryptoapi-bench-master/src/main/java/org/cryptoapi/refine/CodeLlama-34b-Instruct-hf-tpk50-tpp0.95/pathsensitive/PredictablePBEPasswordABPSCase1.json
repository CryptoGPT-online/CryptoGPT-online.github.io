"description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec with a random salt and iteration count, but the key length is fixed to 16 bytes. This makes it vulnerable to a rainbow table attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key length, such as 256 bits, and generate a random salt for each encryption. Additionally, use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-512, for the password hashing."

{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.key()",
"description": "The key generation method uses a weak RNG (SecureRandom) to generate a random salt, which can be predicted by an attacker. This can lead to a weak encryption key being generated, making the encryption scheme vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure RNG, such as a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG), to generate the salt."
