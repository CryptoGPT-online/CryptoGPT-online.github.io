 Here is the optimized misuse JSON, without the false positive misuses:
```json
{
    "misuses": [
        {
            "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
            "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
            "description": "The method `MessageDigest.getInstance` is vulnerable to broken cryptographic algorithm because it does not validate the input string. An attacker can provide a malicious string that causes the method to use a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm, leading to a vulnerability.",
            "recommendation": "Use a secure and validated cryptographic algorithm. Avoid using the `String.valueOf` method to convert the input string to a cryptographic algorithm name, as it can lead to a broken cryptographic algorithm."
        },
        {
            "misuse": "Cryptographic Failure",
            "vulnerable_code": "md.update(str.getBytes());",
            "description": "The method `update` is vulnerable to cryptographic failure because it does not specify a cryptographic algorithm to use. An attacker can provide a malicious input string that causes the method to use a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm, leading to a vulnerability.",
            "recommendation": "Use a secure and validated cryptographic algorithm. Specify the cryptographic algorithm to use when updating the message digest."
        }
    ]
}
```
In the optimized misuse JSON, I have removed the false positive misuses and kept only the misuses that are relevant and applicable to the provided code. The misuse reports that were not applicable to the code were removed, and the remaining misuse reports were optimized to provide more detailed information and recommendations for fixing the vulnerabilities.
