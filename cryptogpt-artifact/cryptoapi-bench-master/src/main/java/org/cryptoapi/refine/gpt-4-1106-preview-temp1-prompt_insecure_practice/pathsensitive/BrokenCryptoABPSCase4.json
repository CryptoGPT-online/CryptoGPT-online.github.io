### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Improper Exception Handling" is not directly related to cryptographic API misuse. It is more about general exception handling practices in Java.
2. "Insufficient Entropy" is a potential issue, but without evidence that the default `KeyGenerator` is not using a secure random source, this cannot be confirmed as a misuse.
3. "Deterministic Encryption" is mentioned as a misuse due to the lack of an IV for CBC mode. However, the code does not show the use of a static IV, and the misuse would only be valid if the same key and IV are reused for multiple encryptions, which is not demonstrated in the provided code snippet.
4. "Invalid Key Exception Potential" is a valid concern, but it is not a misuse in this context because the code ensures that an AES key is used with an AES cipher when `choice > 1`.
