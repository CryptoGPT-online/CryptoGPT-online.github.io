        "description": "The iteration count for password-based encryption is derived from a hard-coded value in the code, this can be subject to brute force attacks. It is a best practice to use a high number of iterations such as 65536 or more, which reduces the risk of brute force attacks. The iteration count can be parameterized in a configuration file instead of hardcoding it in the code.",

        "description": "The salt value used for password-based encryption is generated from a hard-coded length (32). While a fixed salt does provide some security benefit in avoiding precomputation attacks, it also introduces predictability in the generation of hash values, making it easier to detect when the same password is used with different salt values.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to generate a random salt value for each password, and store it alongside the hashed password. In password-based encryption, salting is a standard practice and ensures better security."
