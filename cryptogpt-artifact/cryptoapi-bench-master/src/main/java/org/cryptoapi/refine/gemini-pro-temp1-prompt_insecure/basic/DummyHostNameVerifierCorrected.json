    "misuse category": "CWE-547: Improper Check for SSL/TLS Certificate Trust",
    "vulnerable_method": "Dr.verify",
    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "The code uses the default hostname verifier, which only checks if the hostname matches the Common Name (CN) in the server's certificate. This is not a reliable way to verify the identity of the server, as it is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a hostname verifier that checks the certificate chain of the server and ensures that it is signed by a trusted certificate authority."

    "vulnerable_method": "Dr.verify",
    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "The code uses the default hostname verifier, which is insecure and can be bypassed by attackers.",

    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "This code uses the default hostname verifier, which is insecure. An attacker could use a man-in-the-middle attack to spoof the hostname and intercept the connection.",

    "vulnerable_method": "Dr.verify",
    "vulnerable_code": "HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier()",
    "description": "Using the default hostname verifier may allow attackers to bypass hostname verification and perform man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a custom hostname verifier that checks the hostname against a trusted list or uses certificate pinning to verify the server's identity."

    "misuse category": "CWE-297: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "Dr.verify",
    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "The code uses the default hostname verifier provided by HttpsURLConnection, which relies on the system's default trust manager and hostname verifier. This may lead to vulnerabilities if the system's trust manager and hostname verifier are not properly configured or if they have known vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hostname verifier, such as one that verifies the hostname against a known list of trusted certificates, or implement your own hostname verification logic."
