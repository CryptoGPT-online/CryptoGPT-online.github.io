```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The AES key is being generated with the default key size, which could result in inadequate encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a key size when generating the AES key, for example by using `keyGen.init(256)` to generate a 256-bit key."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code is using AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding for encryption, but it does not specify the initialization vector (IV), which can weaken the encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a secure random IV and use it in the cipher initialization to strengthen the encryption."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm, which is considered secure, but there is a risk of future developments affecting the security of the algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more future-proof algorithm like AES/GCM/NoPadding or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code is explicitly selecting the CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which may not be the most secure option.",
    "recommendation": "Prefer using GCM mode with authenticated encryption (AEAD) over CBC mode with PKCS5 padding for better security and integrity protection."
