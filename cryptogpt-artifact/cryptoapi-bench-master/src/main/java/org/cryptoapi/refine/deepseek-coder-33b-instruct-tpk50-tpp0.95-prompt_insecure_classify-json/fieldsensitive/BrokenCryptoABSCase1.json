### False Positive Misuse ###
The false positive misuses are:

1. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   Misuse code: "defaultAlgo = defAlgo;"
   Description: This misuse is only a part of the initialization of the C2 class and does not perform any encryption operation. Therefore, it does not directly lead to a security vulnerability.

2. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
   Misuse code: "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);"
   Description: Although the code might create a Cipher object with a potentially broken cipher, it does not directly perform encryption, so it does not pose a security risk.
