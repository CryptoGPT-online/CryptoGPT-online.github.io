### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **False Positive Misuse**: "Weak Key Size in AES"
   - **Reason**: The code clearly attempts to use a key size of 16 bytes (128 bits), which is a valid and commonly used key size for AES encryption. Though the recommendation mentions considering using 256 bits if a higher security margin is needed, using 128 bits is not inherently insecure and complies with standard AES security requirements. Therefore, labeling it a "weak" key size is misleading.
