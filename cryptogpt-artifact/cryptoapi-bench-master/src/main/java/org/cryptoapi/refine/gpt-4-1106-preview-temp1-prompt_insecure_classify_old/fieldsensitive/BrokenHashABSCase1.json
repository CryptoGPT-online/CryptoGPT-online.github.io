### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values. - This misuse is mentioned related to encryption, implying that an IV or salt may be needed for randomness. However, the given code only performs hashing, which doesn't typically require such randomness. The complaint about not providing a mechanism for using a secure random value is not relevant unless there's actual encryption or unless the hash is used for password storage (which is not indicated here).

2. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials. - There is no evidence that 'abc' is a password or cryptographic key; it appears to be just a sample string for hashing. Thus, mentioning that hardcoded 'abc' could lead to hardcoded credentials is speculative without further context.

3. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength. - The code is incorrectly criticized for not using encryption, but not for the weakness of SHA1. Since the class named `C1` doesn't perform encryption at all, we shouldn't state that it has inadequate encryption strength but rather that it is not performing encryption.

4. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength (statements regarding specification of a character encoding) - These statements are more about potential Unicode encoding problems than about encryption strength, and this misuse seems incorrectly labeled under CWE-326.
