  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Use of Crypto API",

    "description": "The value returned by the hash map is being used to construct a PBEParameterSpec, which is a critical security component. However, the value is not being properly verified before being used, which could lead to an attacker controlling the salt value used in the encryption process.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a secure random number generator to generate the salt value, and to verify that the salt value is properly formatted and not empty. Additionally, the count value should be checked to ensure that it is a valid and reasonable value."
