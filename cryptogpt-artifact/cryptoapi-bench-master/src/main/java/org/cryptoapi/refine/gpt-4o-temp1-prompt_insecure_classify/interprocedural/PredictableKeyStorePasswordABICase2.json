### False Positive Misuse ###

CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation

**Reason**: The URL used in the code (`https://www.google.com`) does not imply loading a KeyStore in a manner that requires validating Googleâ€™s certificate since the code snippet lacks context indicating a real use case of certificate loading for security-sensitive operations. In many teaching or illustrative examples, such URLs are placeholders, and actual certificate validation logic would be implemented differently as per the application's security design requirements.
