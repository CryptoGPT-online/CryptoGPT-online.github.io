### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**: This is a false positive because the code uses `SecureRandom` to generate the password which is a cryptographically strong random number generator. The method `random.ints()` generates an effectively infinite stream of random integers, which should provide sufficient randomness when converted to a string for this use case. However, the implementation should ensure enough entropy and apply proper encoding to the generated password, which may not be guaranteed by the simplistic conversion shown, but the misuse categorization is too harsh assuming the SecureRandom is used properly elsewhere.
