  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "B9.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the SHA-1 algorithm for hashing, which is considered broken and no longer secure. SHA-1 has been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This makes it insecure for use in applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of SHA-1."
  },

    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "B9.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The SHA-1 algorithm is considered weak and should not be used for new applications. It is recommended to use a stronger algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3.",
    "recommendation": "Replace SHA-1 with a stronger hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
