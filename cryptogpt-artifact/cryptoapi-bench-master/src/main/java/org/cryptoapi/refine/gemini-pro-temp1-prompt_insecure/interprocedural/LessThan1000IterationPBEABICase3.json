### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Unprotected Secret (CWE-321):** The misuse report for "Unprotected Secret (CWE-321)" is a false positive. The `PBEParameterSpec` object is not created without initializing the salt and iterationCount fields. It is initialized with a cryptographically secure random salt and an appropriate iteration count in the `method1` function.
