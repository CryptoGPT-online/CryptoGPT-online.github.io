Based on the code, only misuses related to Cipher.getInstance() and KeyGenerator.getInstance() lines can be considered false positives. 

The Cipher.getInstance() method is called twice - once with "RC4" and once with "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding". The "if" condition in the code implies that "RC4" is used only if "choice > 1", hence, the first misuse does not appear false positive.

For the KeyGenerator.getInstance() line, SecureRandom is not used to initialize the key generator. A true misuse, as this can lead to vulnerability to attackers as the secret key is not strong.

Below are the optimized JSON misuses:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\")",
        "description": "The use of the RC4 stream cipher is considered weak and insecure. It's recommended to use stronger algorithms like AES.",
        "recommendation": "Change 'RC4' to 'AES' or 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding' in the Cipher.getInstance() method."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\").generateKey()",
        "description": "The use of the KeyGenerator class to generate a secret key is not strong enough for secure encryption. It's recommended to use a SecureRandom object with a strong random number generator algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a SecureRandom object to generate the secret key, for example: SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom(); KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\"); keyGen.init(256, secureRandom);"
    }
]
```
