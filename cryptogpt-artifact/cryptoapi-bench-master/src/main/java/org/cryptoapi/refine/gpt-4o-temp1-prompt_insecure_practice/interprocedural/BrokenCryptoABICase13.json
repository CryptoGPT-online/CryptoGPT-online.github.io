### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Predictable Pseudo-random Key Generation**: 
   - **Reason**: RC4 as an algorithm does not support specifying key size in the same way as AES, and the default behavior of `KeyGenerator.getInstance()` is appropriately secure for most use cases when the algorithm itself supports it. Although there's a conceptual concern about the default `SecureRandom`, the more critical issue here is the use of RC4 itself, rather than the key generation specifics.
   
2. **Insecure Use of Crypto API**:
   - **Reason**: While passing algorithm names as strings can potentially allow for insecure algorithms if not controlled, in this specific context, the value `cryptoAlgo` is controlled by the calling code as `"RC4"`. The primary issue highlighted should focus specifically on the use of RC4 itself, which is already reported as another issue, rather than the fact that the string is passed without validation.

3. **Use of Algorithm with Insufficient Key Size**:
   - **Reason**: The concern for insufficient key size primarily applies to algorithms like AES where key size determines strength. RC4 key length varies depending on implementation but focusing on the RC4's vulnerabilities is critical.
