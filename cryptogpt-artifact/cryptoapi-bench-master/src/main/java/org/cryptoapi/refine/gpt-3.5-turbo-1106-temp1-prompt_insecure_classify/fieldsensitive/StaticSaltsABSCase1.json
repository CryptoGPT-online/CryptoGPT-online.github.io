[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "defSalt = salt;",
    "description": "The code assigns a static and predictable value to the salt, which can lead to the generation of weak encryption keys.",

    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
    "description": "The code uses a low iteration count for the encryption algorithm, which reduces the strength of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a more appropriate value to enhance the encryption strength."

  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(passedSalt, count);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec is being initialized with a low iteration count (1020), which may lead to weak encryption. It is recommended to use a higher iteration count (e.g. 10000 or more) for stronger encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a more secure value (e.g. 10000 or more)."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "passedSalt = defSalt;",
    "description": "The passedSalt parameter is assigned to a default salt value. This means that the salt value passed to the method, which is used for key derivation, will always be the same as the default value. Using a static or predictable salt reduces the strength of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random salt value for each encryption operation and use it instead of the default salt value."
