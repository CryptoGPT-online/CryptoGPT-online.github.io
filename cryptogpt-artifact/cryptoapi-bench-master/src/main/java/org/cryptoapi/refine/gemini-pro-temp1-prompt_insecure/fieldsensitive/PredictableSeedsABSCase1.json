    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
    "description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is predictable, which may allow an attacker to guess the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator and seed it with a truly random value, such as from `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
    "description": "The code is using a SecureRandom instance with a weak seed. This can lead to predictable or guessable random numbers, which could compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong seed for the SecureRandom instance. For example, generate a truly random seed using a cryptographically secure random number generator."

    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
    "description": "Using a fixed or predictable seed for SecureRandom can result in the generation of weak or predictable random numbers. This can compromise the security of cryptographic operations that rely on randomness, such as key generation or encryption. In this case, the seed is derived from a constant array `defSeed`, which makes the random numbers predictable and vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (such as `java.security.SecureRandom`) that is properly seeded with a cryptographically strong random seed. Consider using a hardware random number generator or a combination of multiple entropy sources to improve the randomness of the seed."

    "description": "The SecureRandom object is seeded with a user-supplied seed that is not properly generated. This can lead to a predictable sequence of random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker.",

    "description": "The code uses a weak random seed, which is the same for all instances of the `C1` class. This makes it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator.",
