[
  {
    "misuse category": "Weak Encryption Algorithm (CWE-256)",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\");",
    "description": "DES is a weak encryption algorithm and should not be used for new applications. It is recommended to use a stronger algorithm such as AES.",
    "recommendation": "Change the key generation algorithm to a stronger one, such as AES."

    "misuse category": "ECB Mode (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "ECB mode is a vulnerable block cipher mode of operation that does not provide confidentiality. An attacker can easily identify and modify individual blocks of ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM."
  }
