### False Positive Misuses

1. "Insecure Random Number Generation" - The code uses a fixed seed for the random number generator, which can lead to predictable random numbers and a weak encryption. However, this misuse is not applicable in the current context as the code does not use a random number generator.
2. "Insufficient Input Validation" - The code does not validate the input, which can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious data and compromise the encryption or decryption process. However, this misuse is not applicable in the current context as the code does not accept any user input.
