    "description": "The use of hardcoded key 'changeit' is a security risk as it is a commonly used default password for the Java keystore. Using a weak or default password can make the keystore vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong and unique password for the keystore and avoid using hardcoded passwords. Additionally, implement secure password handling mechanisms such as using a secure password manager or prompting the user to input a password."
