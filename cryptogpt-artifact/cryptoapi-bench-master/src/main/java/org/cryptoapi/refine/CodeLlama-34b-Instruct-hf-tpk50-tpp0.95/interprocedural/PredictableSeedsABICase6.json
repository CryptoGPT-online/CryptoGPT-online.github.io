 ### False Positive Misuses ###

The following misuses were identified as false positives:

1. "Broken Crypto Algorithm" misuse: The SecureRandom constructor used is vulnerable to a side-channel attack that can leak the seed value. However, in this case, the seed value is a constant 100, which is not a sensitive value. Therefore, this misuse is not applicable.
2. "Broken Crypto Algorithm" misuse: The `SecureRandom` class is used with a seed that is not properly generated, which makes the generated random numbers predictable. However, in this case, the seed is a constant 100, which is not a sensitive value. Therefore, this misuse is not applicable.
3. "Broken Crypto Algorithm" misuse: Using a broken crypto algorithm, SecureRandom in this case, can lead to predictable and insecure random numbers being generated. However, in this case, the seed is a constant 100, which is not a sensitive value. Therefore, this misuse is not applicable.
4. "Malleable Cryptography" misuse: Using a malleable cryptographic operation, such as println, can lead to attacks such as side-channel attacks. However, in this case, the output of the println function is not used for any sensitive purposes, so this misuse is not applicable.
