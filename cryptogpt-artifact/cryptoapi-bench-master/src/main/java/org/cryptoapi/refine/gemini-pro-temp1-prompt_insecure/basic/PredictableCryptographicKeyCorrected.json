### False Positive Misuse ###
The following are false positives in the provided misuse lists:

- CWE-326: Inappropriate Encryption Algorithm
   - The code uses the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING algorithm, which is considered a secure and appropriate encryption algorithm.
- CWE-327: Use of a Key-Derivation Function without Salt
   - The code does not use a key-derivation function (KDF) to generate the encryption key.
- CWE-326: Inadequate Key Management
   - The code does not specify any seed value for the `SecureRandom` instance, but the default seed value (derived from the system's entropy source) is considered sufficient for most practical purposes.
- CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
   - The code does not use a hard-coded cryptographic key.
- CWE-757: Use of Insecure Randomness
   - The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate randomness, which is considered a secure and appropriate randomness source.
