### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Static Encryption Key" - The code generates a new key for each encryption operation, so it is not static. However, the key management practices are indeed not clear from the code provided.
2. "Hardcoded Encryption Key" - The key is not hardcoded; it is generated dynamically by the `KeyGenerator` class.
3. "Using a New Key for Each Operation" - This is not inherently a misuse, but rather a design choice. The misuse would be not managing or storing the keys securely, which is not clear from the code provided.
