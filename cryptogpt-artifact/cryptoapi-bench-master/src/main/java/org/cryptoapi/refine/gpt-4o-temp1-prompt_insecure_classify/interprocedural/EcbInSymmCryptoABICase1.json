### False Positive Misuse ###

Upon reviewing the code and the misuse reports, there are no false positives. All instances accurately report the use of AES with ECB mode, which is indeed insecure due to its lack of confidentiality for repeated patterns. Therefore, no entries need to be removed from the misuse lists.
