    "misuse category": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyStore.getInstance(String type)",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "description": "The code uses the hard-coded string \"JKS\" to create an instance of the JKS keystore. This is insecure because the keystore password is stored in plain text in the source code.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to create the keystore, such as passing the keystore password as a parameter to the getInstance() method."

    "misuse category": "CWE-759: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyStore.load(InputStream stream, char[] password)",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), password.toCharArray());",
    "description": "The code uses the JKS keystore, which is a legacy keystore format that is no longer considered secure. Additionally, the code loads the keystore from a URL, which is insecure because the keystore password could be intercepted in transit.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure keystore format, such as PKCS12 or Bouncy Castle, and load the keystore from a secure location."
