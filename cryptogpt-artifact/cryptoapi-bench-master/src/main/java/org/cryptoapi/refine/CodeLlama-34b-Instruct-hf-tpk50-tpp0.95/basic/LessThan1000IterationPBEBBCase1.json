        "description": "The vulnerable code is using the PBEParameterSpec class from Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) to generate a PBE parameter specification, which is then used to derive a cryptographic key. However, the PBEParameterSpec class is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, which can allow an attacker to extract the derived key. This is because the PBEParameterSpec class uses a weak pseudorandom function (PRF) that can be guessed easily. ",

Additionally, the count parameter should be increased to a higher value, such as 100000, to make the key derivation process more computationally expensive and resistant to brute-force attacks."
