 ### Optimized Misuse JSON

Here is the optimized misuse JSON, with only the relevant and non-duplicate misuse reports:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto)",
        "description": "The use of the IDEA algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for encryption purposes. It has been shown to be vulnerable to various attacks and should be replaced with a more secure algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of IDEA with a more secure algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)",
        "description": "The encryption strength is inadequate because the key size is too small.",
        "recommendation": "Use a larger key size, such as 256 bits or larger, to improve the encryption strength."
    }
