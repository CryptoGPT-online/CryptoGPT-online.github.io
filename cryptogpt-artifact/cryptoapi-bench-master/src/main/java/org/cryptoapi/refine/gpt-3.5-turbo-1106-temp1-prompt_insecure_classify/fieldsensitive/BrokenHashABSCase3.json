    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code is using the algorithm specified in the 'crypto' variable to obtain an instance of MessageDigest. This allows an attacker to control the algorithm used for hashing.",
    "recommendation": "Use a fixed, secure algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead of allowing the algorithm to be specified by user input."
