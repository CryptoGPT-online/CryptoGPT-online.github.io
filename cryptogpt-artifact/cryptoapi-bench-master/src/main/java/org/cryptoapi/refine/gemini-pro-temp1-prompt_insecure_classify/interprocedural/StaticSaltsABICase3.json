```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "The salt used for the PBE key derivation is not sufficiently random. It is a constant value, which makes the encryption predictable and vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a cryptographically secure random salt using a secure random number generator (e.g. `SecureRandom` in Java)."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
    "description": "The iteration count used for the PBKDF2 key derivation is too low. It is recommended to use at least 10,000 iterations, and more for sensitive applications.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a secure value (e.g. at least 10,000)."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "method2",
    "vulnerable_code": "int count2 = c;\nmethod2(s,count2);",
    "description": "The variable `count2` is initialized with the value of `count`, which is 1020. This value is too low for the number of iterations in the PBKDF2 algorithm. A low iteration count makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the value of `count` to a more secure value, such as at least 100,000."
