  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code is using SecureRandom to generate a 32-byte salt for the PBEParameterSpec. However, the SecureRandom instance is not seeded with any non-predictable value, which means the generated salt may not be sufficiently random.",
    "recommendation": "Seeding the SecureRandom instance with a non-predictable value before generating the salt, such as using a system-specific source of entropy or a random number generator provided by the operating system."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)));",
    "description": "The use of PBEParameterSpec with Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)) is vulnerable to CWE-327 because it uses a non-random value as the second parameter which weakens the encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong, random value for the second parameter of PBEParameterSpec."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(count)));",
    "description": "The code is using an inadequate encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm and increase the key length and iteration number to enhance the encryption strength."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "secureRandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The salt value is generated using SecureRandom class, which is generally considered to produce cryptographically secure random values. However, the code does not specify the algorithm or provider explicitly, leaving it up to the default settings of the JVM which may not always be sufficient.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the algorithm and provider for SecureRandom explicitly."
