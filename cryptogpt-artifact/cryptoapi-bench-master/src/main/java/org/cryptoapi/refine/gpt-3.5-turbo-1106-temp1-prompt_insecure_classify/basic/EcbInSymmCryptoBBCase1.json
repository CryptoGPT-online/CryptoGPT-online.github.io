  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
    "description": "The code is using the ECB mode of operation for AES encryption, which is known to be insecure. ECB mode does not provide proper security because it does not use an initialization vector (IV) and does not add any randomness to the encryption process. This can lead to pattern detection and information leakage.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) mode. Also, always provide a unique and random IV for each encryption operation."
