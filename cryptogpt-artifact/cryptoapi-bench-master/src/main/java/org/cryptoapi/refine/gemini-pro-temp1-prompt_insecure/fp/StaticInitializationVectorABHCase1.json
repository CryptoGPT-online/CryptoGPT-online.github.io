### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (Initial list 1)
2. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (Initial list 2)

**Explanation**: In both cases, the "hard-coded key" is actually an Initialization Vector (IV). An IV is not a cryptographic key, and it is not used to encrypt or decrypt data. It is simply used to initialize the cipher, and it does not need to be kept secret.
