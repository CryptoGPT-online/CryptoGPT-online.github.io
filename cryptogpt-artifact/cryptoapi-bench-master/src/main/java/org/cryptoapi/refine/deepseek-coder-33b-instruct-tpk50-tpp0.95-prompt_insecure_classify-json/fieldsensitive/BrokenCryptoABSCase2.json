False Positive Misuse: 
There doesn't seem to be any false positive misuses in the provided misuse lists. All the vulnerabilities are valid misuses as the CWE-327 (Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), and CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) categorizations are applicable to the provided code.

        "recommendation": "Properly validate the certificates if you're using SSL/TLS. You can use certificate pinning or certificate chain validation."
