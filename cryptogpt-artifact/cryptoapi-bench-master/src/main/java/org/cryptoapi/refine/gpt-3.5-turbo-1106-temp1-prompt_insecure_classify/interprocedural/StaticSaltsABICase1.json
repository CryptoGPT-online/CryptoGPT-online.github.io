    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is using a low iteration count (1020) which can make the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",

    "description": "The salt value used in the PBEParameterSpec constructor is a hardcoded value 0xa2, which is not sufficiently random.",
