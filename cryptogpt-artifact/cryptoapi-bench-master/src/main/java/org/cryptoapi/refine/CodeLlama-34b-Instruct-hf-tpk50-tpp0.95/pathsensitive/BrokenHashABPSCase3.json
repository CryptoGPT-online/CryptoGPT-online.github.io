 ### False Positive Misuses ###

* Misuse: Broken Crypto Algorithm, Vulnerable Code: MessageDigest.getInstance("MD4"), Recommendation: Replace MD4 with SHA-256.
* Misuse: Insecure Random Number Generation, Vulnerable Code: name.getBytes(), Recommendation: Use SecureRandom instead of name.getBytes().
* Misuse: Misuse of the `if` statement, Vulnerable Code: if(choice>1), Recommendation: Use a secure and constant-time comparison instead of the `if` statement.
