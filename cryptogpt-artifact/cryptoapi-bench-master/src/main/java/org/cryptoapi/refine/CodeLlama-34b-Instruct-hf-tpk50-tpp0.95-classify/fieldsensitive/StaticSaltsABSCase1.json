Here is the optimized JSON list of misuses:

{
"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(passedSalt, count);",

"description": "The salt is a hardcoded value and not randomly generated, which may make it easier for an attacker to guess or brute-force the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Generate a random salt value and use it for encryption."
}
]
}

Therefore, the final list of misuses is:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
The use of a hardcoded and insecure salt value, and a low iteration count, makes it easier for attackers to guess the password and gain unauthorized access to the encrypted data.
Recommendation: Use a randomly generated salt value and increase the iteration count to make it harder for attackers to guess the password.
2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
The salt is a hardcoded value and not randomly generated, which may make it easier for an attacker to guess or brute-force the encryption.
Recommendation: Generate a random salt value and use it for encryption.
