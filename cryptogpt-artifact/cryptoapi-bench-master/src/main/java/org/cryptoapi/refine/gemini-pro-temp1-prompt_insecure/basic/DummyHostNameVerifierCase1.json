[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_method": "D1.verify",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n    return true;\n}",
    "description": "The code always returns true, which means that any certificate will be accepted, regardless of its validity or trustworthiness. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server or intercept communications.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation by checking the certificate's validity, hostname, and issuer. Use a library like 'jsse' to simplify this process."

    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "D1.verify",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n    return true;\n}",
    "description": "This code always returns true, which means that any hostname will be accepted as valid, regardless of whether it matches the hostname in the certificate presented by the server. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate server and intercept communications between the application and the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that checks the hostname in the certificate against the hostname of the server that the application is connecting to."
