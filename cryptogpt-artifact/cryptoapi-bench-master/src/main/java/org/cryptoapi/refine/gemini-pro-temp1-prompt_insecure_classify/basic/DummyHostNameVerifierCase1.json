  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_method": "D1.verify",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n        return true;\n    }",
    "description": "This code unconditionally returns true, which means that any hostname will be verified as valid. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate server and intercept traffic.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by checking the hostname against a trusted list of server certificates or by using a certificate authority (CA) to verify the server's certificate."
