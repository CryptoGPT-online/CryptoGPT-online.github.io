### False Positive Misuse ###

There are no false positives in this case. The misuse reports correctly identify the use of MD2 as a risky and broken cryptographic algorithm, which is a known problem in security practices. MD2 has been deprecated and should not be used for secure cryptographic hash functions due to its vulnerabilities to preimage and collision attacks. All the misuse reports provided are applicable, and no further filtering is needed to remove non-applicable misuses.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

As all reports provide similar information, we can optimize by consolidating them into a single report that adequately represents the misuse for better clarity. Here is the optimized report:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
        "description": "The use of MD2 as the cryptographic hash function is insecure as it is considered broken and vulnerable to collision and preimage attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
```
