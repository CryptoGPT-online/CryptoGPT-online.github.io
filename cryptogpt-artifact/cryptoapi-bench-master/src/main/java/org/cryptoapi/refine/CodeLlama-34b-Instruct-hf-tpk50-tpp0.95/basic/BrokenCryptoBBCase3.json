 ### False Positive Misuse JSON

* Misuse 1: Broken Crypto Algorithm
	+ Vulnerable code: `KeyGenerator.getInstance("RC4");`
	+ Description: The code uses the insecure RC4 algorithm for key generation. RC4 is a weak stream cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. It should not be used in new code and should be replaced with a more secure algorithm such as AES.
	+ Recommendation: Replace the usage of RC4 with a more secure algorithm such as AES.
* Misuse 2: Insecure Key Generation
	+ Vulnerable code: `SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey()`
	+ Description: The use of a hard-coded encryption key, which makes it vulnerable to reverse engineering and exposure to unauthorized parties. Additionally, using a hard-coded key means that the same key is used every time the code is run, which can make it easier for an attacker to perform a known-plaintext attack.
	+ Recommendation: Generate a unique encryption key for each encryption operation and use a secure method of key distribution, such as public-key encryption, instead of hard-coding the key.
* Misuse 3: Lack of Key Management
	+ Vulnerable code: `Cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)`
	+ Description: The use of a static key for encryption, which makes it vulnerable to attacks that rely on knowledge of the key. Additionally, using a static key means that the same key is used every time the code is run, which can make it easier for an attacker to perform a known-plaintext attack.
	+ Recommendation: Use a secure method of key distribution, such as public-key encryption, and generate a unique encryption key for each encryption operation.

### Optimized Misuse JSON

* Misuse 4: Broken Crypto Algorithm
	+ Vulnerable code: `KeyGenerator.getInstance("RC4"); Cipher.getInstance("RC4");`
	+ Description: The code uses the insecure RC4 algorithm for key generation and encryption/decryption. RC4 is a weak stream cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. It should not be used in new code and should be replaced with a more secure algorithm such as AES.
	+ Recommendation: Replace the usage of RC4 with a more secure algorithm such as AES.
* Misuse 5: Insecure Key Generation
	+ Vulnerable code: `SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey()`
	+ Description: The use of a hard-coded encryption key, which makes it vulnerable to reverse engineering and exposure to unauthorized parties. Additionally, using a hard-coded key means that the same key is used every time the code is run, which can make it easier for an attacker to perform a known-plaintext attack.
	+ Recommendation: Generate a unique encryption key for each encryption operation and use a secure method of key distribution, such as public-key encryption, instead of hard-coding the key.
* Misuse 6: Lack of Key Management
