### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse in the first list above is not false positive since we are passing null value to the method which is used to create the IvParameterSpec object in the second line which is a hard coded IV.

        "recommendation": "Consider using more secure and up-to-date encryption algorithms, modes, and padding schemes. For example, 'AES/GCM/NoPadding' would be a secure alternative."
