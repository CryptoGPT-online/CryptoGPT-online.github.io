### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: Predictable Salt**
   - The description in the misuse indicates that using `SecureRandom` for salt generation is generally secure and mentions a concern that is hypothetical if the salt is reused across operations. This doesn't indicate a misuse in the current context provided by the code, since `SecureRandom` is utilized correctly, and the code does not show reuse of salt.

        "misuse": "Fixed Iteration Count in PBEParameterSpec",
        "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbe = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "An iteration count of 20 is considered too low for secure password-based encryption. Low iteration counts can make brute-force attacks more feasible.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 10000 or more, depending on current security guidelines and performance requirements."
