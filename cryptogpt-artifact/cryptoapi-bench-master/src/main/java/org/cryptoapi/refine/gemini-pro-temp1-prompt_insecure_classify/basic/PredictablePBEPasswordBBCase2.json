    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length is set to 16 bytes, which is considered insecure for modern cryptographic algorithms. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits (32 bytes) for symmetric algorithms.",

    "vulnerable_method": "P2.key",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random bytes, but it is not explicitly seeded. This means that the generated random bytes may be predictable, which could compromise the security of the generated key.",
    "recommendation": "Properly seed the `SecureRandom` instance with a strong source of randomness, such as `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."
