### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys and Hardcoded Cryptographic Key or IV**

   Explanation: The misuse reports titled "Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys" and "Hardcoded Cryptographic Key or IV" identify the string "abcde". However, there is a clear distinction in the code that the byte array is being used as an IV, not a cryptographic key. Considering that it is directly related to IV misconfiguration, these can be combined into a single IV-related misuse report. Both are essentially describing the same misconfiguration described thoroughly in other reports.

2. **Hardcoded Initialization Vector (IV)**

   Explanation: Since similar issues related to hardcoded IV have been captured well in the first identified misuse on the list, having another report with almost identical information is redundant. 

Thus, the two reports under (1) and the redundant report under (2) are recognized as false positives due to their repetitive nature considering the context.
