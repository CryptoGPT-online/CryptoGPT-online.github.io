### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses have been identified as false positives. The use of a 1024-bit RSA key is indeed a legitimate concern in terms of cryptographic strength according to modern standards.

        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "int keySize = 1024;",
        "description": "The RSA key size of 1024 bits is considered inadequate and potentially vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Modern cryptographic practices recommend using a minimum key size of 2048 bits or higher for RSA encryption to ensure adequate security.",
