### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "No SecureRandom specified" - This is a false positive because the `KeyGenerator` class is designed to use a secure random number generator by default. While it is good practice to explicitly specify a secure random number generator, the absence of such specification does not necessarily mean that a non-secure RNG is used.

2. "Missing Initialization Vector (IV)" - This is a false positive because RC2 is a block cipher that can operate without an explicit IV, unlike CBC mode which requires an IV. However, the use of RC2 itself is not recommended due to its weak encryption strength.
