### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse reports are centered on the manual seeding of `SecureRandom` with a static and predictable seed value, namely `DEFAULT_SEED`. While this is generally a bad practice in a security context due to introducing predictability into supposedly random values, this code snippet could be part of a larger context or system where predictability is desired or necessary, such as in testing environments or deterministic simulations. If this is not the case, and the random values are indeed being used for security-critical operations, this would not classify as a false positive.

However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that the purpose of using `SecureRandom` is indeed for cryptographic operations, and the reported misuse is valid.

Given the provided information, there seem to be no false positives, as both concerns about setting a static seed for `SecureRandom` and the inadequate length of the hardcoded seed are legitimate security concerns.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

The repeated listings essentially report the same misuse instances with slight variations in descriptions and code snippets provided. To avoid redundancy, I will collapse them into two distinct misuse reports, one for each type of the reported misuse.
