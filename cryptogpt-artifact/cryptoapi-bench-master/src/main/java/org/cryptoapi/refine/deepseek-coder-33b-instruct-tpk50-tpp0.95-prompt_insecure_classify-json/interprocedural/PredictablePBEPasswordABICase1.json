### False Positive Misuse ###

The following misuses from the given list are not detected in the code:

[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
        "description": "The key length is set to 16 bits which is too low for modern systems.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 128 bits. For even better security, consider using a higher key length."
    }
]

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "The iteration count is low which does not provide enough computation to make the generated key secure.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count. Typically, a minimum of 10000 iterations is recommended."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to a low value, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value to make brute-force attacks more expensive and more time-consuming."
    }
