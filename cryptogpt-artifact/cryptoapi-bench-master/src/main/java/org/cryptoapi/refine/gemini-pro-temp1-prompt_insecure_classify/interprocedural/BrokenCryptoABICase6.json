```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "private static void go2()",
    "vulnerable_code": "CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();",
    "description": "The code uses a statically defined default cryptography algorithm (DEFAULT_CRYPTO) without considering the security implications. This makes the application vulnerable to attacks that exploit weak algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm and avoid hardcoding the algorithm choice. Instead, use a configuration mechanism to allow for algorithm selection based on security requirements and algorithm availability."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_method": "private static void go3()",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = CRYPTO;",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded default crypto algorithm (\"Blowfish\") without allowing for negotiation or considering the strength of the algorithm. This can lead to the selection of a weak or outdated algorithm, making the encryption less secure.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding the default algorithm, consider using a more secure and modern algorithm, such as AES-256, and allow for algorithm negotiation during key exchange to ensure the use of a strong algorithm."
