### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "ECB Mode in AES" is a false positive because the provided code does not show any use of encryption or specify any mode of operation such as ECB. The misuse is based on an assumption that is not evident in the code.

2. "Static Initialization Vector (IV)" is a false positive because the code does not perform any encryption or decryption operations, nor does it specify the use of an IV. The misuse is speculative and not based on the provided code.

3. "Missing Encryption/Decryption" is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse because the code snippet is incomplete and does not show the full context of how the `SecretKeySpec` is used. It is not a misuse of the API itself but rather an incomplete implementation.
