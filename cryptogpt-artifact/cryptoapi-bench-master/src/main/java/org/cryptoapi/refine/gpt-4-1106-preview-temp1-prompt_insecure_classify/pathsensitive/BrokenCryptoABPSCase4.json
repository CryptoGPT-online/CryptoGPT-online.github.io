### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength for AES key generation** - Although it is best practice to specify the key size, the default key size for AES in most Java implementations is 128 bits, which is still considered secure. Without additional details indicating that the environment defaults to a weaker key size, we cannot assume that the key size is inadequate.

2. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - The `KeyGenerator` class in Java Cryptography Architecture uses a secure random number generator by default for key generation. Unless it can be determined that the default `SecureRandom` instance is not sufficient, this is typically not a misuse.

Given these points, misuse reports related to "Inadequate Encryption Strength" for the key generation and "Use of Insufficiently Random Values" are false positives, provided that the Java environment is using default settings which presume a key size of 128 bits for AES and a secure `SecureRandom` instance.
