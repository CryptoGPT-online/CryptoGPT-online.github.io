[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class should be instantiated with a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG). The default constructor may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a CSPRNG such as `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")` or `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to generate cryptographically strong random values."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "passedCount = defcount;",
    "description": "The number of iterations used in the key derivation function (KDF) is too low, which can make the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to a value that is considered cryptographically secure, such as 100,000 or more."
