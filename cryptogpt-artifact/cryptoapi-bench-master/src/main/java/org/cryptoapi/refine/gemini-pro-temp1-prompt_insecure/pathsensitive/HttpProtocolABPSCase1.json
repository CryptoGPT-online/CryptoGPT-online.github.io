### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse**: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
   **Vulnerable code**: `System.out.println(new URL(url));`
   **Reasoning**: The code does not establish a network connection, it only constructs a `URL` object. No certificate validation is performed at this stage, making the misuse inapplicable.
