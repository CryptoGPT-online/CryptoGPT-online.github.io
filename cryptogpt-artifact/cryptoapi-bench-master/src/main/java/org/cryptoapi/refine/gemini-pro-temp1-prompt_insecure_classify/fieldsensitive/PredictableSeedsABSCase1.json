[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "P1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "crypto.method1(new byte[]{(byte)0, (byte)0});",
    "description": "The `method1` method uses a custom encryption algorithm that is not cryptographically secure. This can allow an attacker to decrypt the encrypted data or forge new messages.",
    "recommendation": "Use a well-known and cryptographically secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
  },

    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "C1.C1",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
    "description": "The seed used to initialize the `SecureRandom` object is fixed and predictable, which makes it easy for an attacker to guess the generated random values.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the seed. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to get a CSPRNG instance."

    "vulnerable_method": "C1.method1",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
    "description": "The seed used to initialize the `SecureRandom` object is not sufficiently random. The `setSeed` method should be called with a truly random seed value, such as one generated using `SecureRandom.generateSeed` or `/dev/urandom`.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger seed value, such as one generated using `SecureRandom.generateSeed` or `/dev/urandom`."
