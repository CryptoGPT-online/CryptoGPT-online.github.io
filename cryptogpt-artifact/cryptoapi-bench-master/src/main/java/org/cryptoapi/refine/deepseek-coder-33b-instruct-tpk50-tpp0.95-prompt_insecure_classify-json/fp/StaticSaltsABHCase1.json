## False Positive Misuse:
The salt value for the PBE (Password-Based Encryption) is a constant byte value. This is not random and could potentially weaken the encryption.

        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_method": "S1.key2()",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");\n...\nbyte[] salt = {b, b};",
        "description": "In the given code, the salt for PBEParameterSpec is created using a Byte object as a salt. Byte values (salt) are usually created with a hardcoded value or random byte generation which can create a security issue in terms of randomness. PBEParameterSpec needs a cryptographically strong random salt or an empty array for the iterations count parameter.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using a hardcoded Byte value, a random salt value should be used. This will enhance the security of the PBE algorithm."

        "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;\n...\nPBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
        "description": "The iteration count for the PBEParameterSpec is relatively low (1020), this means that the hash function will be applied less times, potentially resulting in an inadequate encryption strength.",
        "recommendation": "Consider increasing the iteration count for PBEParameterSpec to at least 100000 (the minimum recommended by NIST) to ensure a stronger encryption algorithm."
