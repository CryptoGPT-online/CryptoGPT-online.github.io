  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String algorithm)",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses the default key size of 128 bits for AES, which is considered weak. Encryption keys should use a key length of at least 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to at least 256 bits by using `KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", 256);`."

    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "IvParameterSpec(byte[] iv)",
    "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
    "description": "The code uses a constant value (`\"abcde\".getBytes()`) as the Initialization Vector (IV) for CBC mode encryption, which makes the encryption predictable. Initialization vectors should be cryptographically random and unique for each encryption operation.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a cryptographically secure random IV using `SecureRandom` class for each encryption operation."
