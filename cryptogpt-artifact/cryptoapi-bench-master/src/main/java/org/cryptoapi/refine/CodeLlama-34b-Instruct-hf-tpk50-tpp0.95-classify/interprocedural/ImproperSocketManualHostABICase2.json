 The misuses JSON after removing false positive misuses would be as follows:
```json
{
    "misuses": [
        {
            "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
            "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory.createSocket()",
            "description": "The use of `SSLSocketFactory.createSocket()` with the default SSL context may result in the use of low encryption strength or deprecated algorithms.",
            "recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date security provider, such as the `org.bouncycastle.jsse.BCSSLSocketFactory`, and specify it as the default SSL socket factory."
        },
        {
            "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
            "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()",
            "description": "The use of `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` without specifying a security provider may result in the use of insecure or deprecated algorithms.",
            "recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date security provider, such as the `org.bouncycastle.jsse.BCSSLSocketFactory`, and specify it as the default SSL socket factory."

            "vulnerable_code": "HOST_NAME = DEFAULT_HOST_NAME.toCharArray()",
            "description": "The code uses a constant host name, which may be predictable and allow an attacker to intercept the communication.",
