### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the misuse reports are false positives. The use of "AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding" in the code is a well-documented risky security practice due to the inherent weaknesses of the ECB mode, regardless of how the code is structured around it.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "String cryptoAlgo = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
        "description": "The code uses AES in ECB mode which is a risky cryptographic algorithm because it does not provide semantic security for encrypted plaintext and can reveal patterns.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of AES, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) with a proper IV (Initialization Vector). For example, use \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\"."
