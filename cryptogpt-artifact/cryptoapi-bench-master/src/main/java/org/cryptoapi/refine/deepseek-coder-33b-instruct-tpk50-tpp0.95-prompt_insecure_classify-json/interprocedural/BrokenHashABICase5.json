### False Positive Misuses

The false positive misuses in this context are the ones that are not relevant or not applicable to the given code. For instance, "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation" is not applicable to the code since it's not dealing with certificates. The same applies to "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials", and "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation".
