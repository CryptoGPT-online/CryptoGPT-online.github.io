### False Positive Misuse ###

The false positives detected in your code are:
1) The use of hardcoded iteration count in PBEKeySpec. The PBEKeySpec's iteration count should be adjusted based on the performance requirements and security needs.
2) The use of a static salt, this might reduce security as attackers can use precomputed tables for rainbow table attacks.
3) The misuse of random number generation in "String.valueOf(random.ints())". It should be a secure random number generation.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

After correcting the misuse, here's the optimized misuse list:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
        "description": "The key length is set to 16 bytes, which is a relatively low value. This could expose sensitive data to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the key length to a higher value, such as at least 32 bytes for AES."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to a high value, which can lead to high CPU usage during key derivation.",
        "recommendation": "You could set a limit on the iteration count based on the security requirements. It is recommended to keep the iteration count low (e.g. less than 10000) to avoid DoS attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = new byte[16]; \nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "SecureRandom is not seeded which can make the random numbers less random and could potentially weakens the randomness",
        "recommendation": "Properly seed the SecureRandom"
    }
]
