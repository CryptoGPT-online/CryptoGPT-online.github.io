        "description": "The iteration count for PBE (Password-Based Encryption) should be high enough to slow down brute-force attacks. An iteration count of 1020 is considered too low, making the encryption vulnerable to such attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 10,000 or more based on current security standards to increase the computation cost for an attacker."
