### False Positive Misuses ###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Weak Randomness",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(); sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is intended for secure random number generation. However, if you do not provide a seed or initial value for a SecureRandom instance, it may generate identical sequences for multiple runs on the same platform and for the same user.",
    "recommendation": "Use java.security.SecureRandom class, which is a cryptographically strong random number generator."
  },

    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
    "description": "Password-based encryption (PBE) schemes, such as PBEWithHmacSHA1, are typically slow to compute and provide resistance against brute force attacks by increasing the cost (the number of iterations). However, for this code the iteration count is set to a relatively low value. If an attacker can capture the time taken to derive keys from your system, they may use this information to crack the encryption key.",
    "recommendation": "Set a higher iteration count (minimum 10000) to make the encryption stronger."

    "misuse": "Insecure Password Storage",
    "vulnerable_code": "private String defPassword;",
    "description": "Storing passwords in plain text is generally a bad idea. If the password is leaked, it can allow an attacker to compromise other accounts as well.",
    "recommendation": "Never store passwords directly. Instead, use a strong one-way hash function to store the hashed password. Java has built-in support for this in its java.security.MessageDigest class."
  },

    "misuse": "Hard-coded Salt",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(); sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "Hard-coding a salt can potentially lead to predictable keys, which can compromise security. The salt should ideally be randomly generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated salt instead of a hard-coded one."

    "vulnerable_code": "passedPassword = defPassword;",
    "description": "The password used in PBEKeySpec is a default one, which might be weak itself. Using a user-supplied password as a salt can be less secure. It's recommended to use a separate random salt for each password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a separate, randomly generated salt for each password. Additionally, consider strengthening the security of the default password."

### Optimized Misuses ###

    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(passedPassword.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code is using PBEKeySpec with a very low iteration count.",
    "recommendation": "Raise the iteration count to at least 1000000 (1,000,000)."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insufficient iteration count in PBKDF2",
    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
    "description": "The current iteration count is considered insecure as it is too low. Using a higher iteration count (like 10000 or more) would make it significantly harder for an attacker to crack the key.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 10,000."
