### False Positive Misuse
{
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{b});",
    "description": "The usage of a byte value from a hashmap as a seed for the SecureRandom constructor can lead to an insecurely random generator.",
    "recommendation": "Always use a random source when seeding the SecureRandom instance, or check if a seed has already been set before setting a new seed."

[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] seed = str.getBytes();\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{b});",
        "description": "This code uses a non-secure seed to initiate SecureRandom. The seed is generated by converting an integer to a string, then to a byte array. The resulting byte array is not secure and might be predictable.",
        "recommendation": "To solve this issue, use a secure way to generate a seed. For example, use the SecureRandom.generateSeed() function. Additionally, ensure that the seed is properly stored and not easily guessable."
