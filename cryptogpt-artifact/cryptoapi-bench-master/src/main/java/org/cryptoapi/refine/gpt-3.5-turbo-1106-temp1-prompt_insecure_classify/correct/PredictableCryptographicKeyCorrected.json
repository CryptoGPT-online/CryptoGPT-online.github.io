    "description": "The defaultKey is generated using random.ints() without specifying any bounds, resulting in insufficiently random and predictable key generation.",
    "recommendation": "Use java.security.SecureRandom to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. Additionally, consider using a key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2 to derive a key from the random bytes for better key generation."

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\");",
    "description": "The code uses AES encryption in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding. While the algorithm itself is not broken, the key generation process is weak and the initialization vector (IV) is not specified for CBC mode, weakening the encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key generation process and specify a cryptographically random IV for CBC mode."
