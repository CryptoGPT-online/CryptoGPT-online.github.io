 ### False Positive Misuses ###

The following misuses are false positives and do not apply to the provided code:

1. CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation
	* The code does not involve algorithm negotiation, and the selected algorithm (SHA-256) is not less secure than other algorithms.
2. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* The algorithm used in the code (SHA-256) is not broken or risky, and the recommendation to use a more secure algorithm (SHA-3 or BLAKE2) does not apply.
3. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* The algorithm used in the code (SHA-256) is not broken or risky, and the recommendation to use a more secure algorithm (SHA-512) does not apply.
4. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* The algorithm used in the code (SHA-256) is not broken or risky, and the recommendation to use a more secure algorithm (SHA-256 or SHA-512) does not apply.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

The following misuses are optimized and relevant to the provided code:

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* The algorithm used in the code (SHA-256) is not broken or risky, but using a weaker algorithm such as SHA-1 or MD5 would be a misuse.
	* Recommendation: Use a secure and robust algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 for cryptographic hash functions.
2. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
	* The cryptographic algorithm used for hashing is considered broken and should not be used in new code.
	* Recommendation: Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-3 or SHA-2 with a larger hash size.
