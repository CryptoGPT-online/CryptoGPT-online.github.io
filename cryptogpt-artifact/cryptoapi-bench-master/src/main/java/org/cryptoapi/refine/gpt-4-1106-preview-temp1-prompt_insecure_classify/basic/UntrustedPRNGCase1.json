### False Positive Misuse ###

Upon reviewing the provided code snippet and the misuse reports, it is noted that the Java class `U1` contains a method `main` that generates a random number using the `java.util.Random` class. The misuse reports all make the claim that `java.util.Random` is not suitable for security-sensitive applications due to its predictability and lack of cryptographic strength.

However, to assess the legitimacy of the misuse reports and determine if they qualify as false positives, we must consider the context in which the `Random` class is used. The context in this case pertains to whether the random number generated is used in a security-critical application, such as cryptography, or for non-security purposes, such as generating random values for general purpose use.

Based on the provided code snippet (`U1` class), there is no evidence to suggest that the random number is being used for any security-sensitive operations; it merely generates an integer and prints it to the console. Consequently, if the use case of the generated random numbers does not involve security, such as encryption keys, tokens, passwords, or any other cryptographic elements, then the reports of misuse related to CWE-330 would be considered false positives.

Without further information that the generated random numbers are used for security purposes, we should assume these are indeed false positives.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

Given the above reasoning, since the context does not indicate a security-sensitive use of the random numbers generated by `java.util.Random`, all of the misuse reports would be deemed false positives. Therefore, the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses would be empty:
