The false positive misuse lists suggest that the algorithm is not secure (RC2) and the key size is not secure (AES with default 256 bit key size). The optimized misuses list is more focused on the selection of less secure algorithm during negotiation. Other identified weak spots in the misuse lists such as using hard-coded seed value to generate keys in AES are also taken care of in the optimized misuses list.
