### False Positive Misuse ###

```json
{
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\"); ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), key.toCharArray());",
    "description": "The code fetches and loads a keystore from an external URL ('https://www.google.com'), which can be manipulated if the connection is not secure, leading to improper certificate validation.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure the URL connection is secure by verifying the server's certificate and ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the keystore before loading it."
}
```

**Reason:** The description of the misuse regarding the loading of a keystore from a URL without validation assumes that the URL might be incorrectly configured or insecure. However, without additional context on how the `URL` object is meant to be used in this scenario or an actual implementation of loading a keystore from an external source, it is not immediately indicative of improper certificate validation. The misuse description suggests additional measures but does not conclusively demonstrate misuse. For an actual misuse, more context is needed to evaluate server connection settings and TLS handling. The current context of using a common URL like "https://www.google.com" seems to misunderstand the intended use or example context.

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
        "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\";",
        "description": "The code uses a hardcoded password ('changeit') for loading a keystore, which makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the keystore.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded credentials. Consider retrieving the password from a secure source or prompting the user to input the password at runtime."
