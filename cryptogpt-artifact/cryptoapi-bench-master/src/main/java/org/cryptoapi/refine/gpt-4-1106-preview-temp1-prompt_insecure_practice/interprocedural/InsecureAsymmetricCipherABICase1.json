### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Low Entropy Creation" - This is a false positive because the string "Secret Message" is likely a placeholder for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, the actual message to be encrypted would be provided by the user or another source, and its entropy would depend on that context.

2. "Inappropriate Exception Handling" - This is a false positive in the context of a simple example or test code. While it is generally good practice to handle exceptions properly, in a small test program like this, it is common to propagate exceptions to the main method for simplicity.

3. "Unspecified Encryption Mode and Padding Scheme" - This is a false positive because RSA is not a block cipher and does not use encryption modes like ECB or CBC. The concern about encryption modes applies to block ciphers, not to RSA.

4. "ECB Mode in Cipher Block Chaining" - This is a false positive because RSA does not use block chaining modes like ECB; it is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that operates on a single block of data.
