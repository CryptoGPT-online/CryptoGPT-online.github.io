### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. All misuse reports accurately identify the use of the RC2 algorithm, which is considered insecure and obsolete. Therefore, all reported issues regarding the use of RC2 are valid and applicable. 

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\"); Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
        "description": "RC2 is a deprecated and insecure encryption algorithm that is vulnerable to various attacks. It does not provide adequate security and is susceptible to cryptographic attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
    }
