From the misuses list, none of them are false positives as they directly relate to cryptographic API misuse. However, the SHA-1 misuse is not recommended to use because it is considered broken and less secure. So, the optimized list of cryptographic API misuses are as follows:

[
    {
        "misuse": "SHA1 Cryptographic Algorithm Used",
        "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The crypto algorithm used in this code is SHA-1 which is known to be broken and not secure for many applications.",
        "recommendation": "Use a strong cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256 or a newer standard like SHA3-256 instead of SHA-1."
    }
]
