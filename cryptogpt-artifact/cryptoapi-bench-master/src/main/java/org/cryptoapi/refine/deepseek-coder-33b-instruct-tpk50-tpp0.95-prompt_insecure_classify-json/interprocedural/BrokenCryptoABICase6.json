False positive misuse:

None of the reported misuses are false positives. They correctly identify potential cryptographic API misuses in the given code. The code uses a non-constant algorithm for key generation and encryption, which is a security risk. Additionally, it uses a static algorithm "Blowfish", which is considered to be weak and broken.

Optimized Misuse JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse_category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_method": "B6.go()",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
        "description": "The use of Blowfish as a cryptographic algorithm is considered insecure. It's recommended to use stronger algorithms.",
        "recommendation": "Replace \"Blowfish\" with a more secure algorithm such as AES."
    }
