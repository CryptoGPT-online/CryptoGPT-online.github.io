### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

[
    {
        "misuse": "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, iterationCount, keyLength);",
        "description": "The provided code uses a weak password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm, which is vulnerable to attacks such as rainbow tables.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger PBE algorithm, such as PBKDF2 or Argon2, and tune the parameters accordingly."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "P1.go()",
        "description": "The method uses the insecure cryptographic algorithm PBE (Password-Based Encryption) with a low iteration count of 11010, which can be brute-forced easily. This can lead to unauthorized access to the encrypted data.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES, and increase the iteration count to make it more secure. Also, use a larger key length to make the derived key more secure."
