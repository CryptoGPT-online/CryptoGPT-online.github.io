### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.**
    - **Vulnerable Code:** `"KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\"); SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();"`
    - **Description:** The concern about insufficient randomness in key generation by not specifying a key size can be considered a false positive because the AES default key size is typically platform-dependent and can foreseeably default to a secure size (e.g., 128 bits). However, specifying an explicit key size is a best practice rather than a strict misuse.
