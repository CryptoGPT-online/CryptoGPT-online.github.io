### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Improper Certificate Validation" - This is not applicable as there is no SSL/TLS or certificate validation code present in the provided code snippet.
2. "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity" - There is no cryptographic signature or MAC verification in the code to ensure data authenticity.
3. "Untrusted Initialization of Cryptographic Keys" - No cryptographic keys are being initialized in the provided code snippet.
4. "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)" - There is no use of PRNG in the given code snippet.
5. "Use of Hard-coded Credentials" - The provided code does not include any hard-coded credentials.
