        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"Blowfish\";",
        "description": "Blowfish is considered a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm due to its small block size and potential security vulnerabilities. It is also not suitable for use with larger data sets.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure and modern cipher algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which provides stronger security guarantees and efficiency. Use AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
