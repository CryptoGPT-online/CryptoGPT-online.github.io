### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength** - Reported for:
   - `"vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"saagar\";"`
   - Reason: The issue of hardcoding a password is about credential management (CWE-798) and not directly related to encryption strength, hence this is a redundancy rather than a direct concern for encryption strength.
