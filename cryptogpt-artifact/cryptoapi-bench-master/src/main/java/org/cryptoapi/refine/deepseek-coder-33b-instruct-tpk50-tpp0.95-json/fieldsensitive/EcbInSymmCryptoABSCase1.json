The reported misuses do not exist on the given Java code. The provided code does not use cryptographic operations. The class L1 and its method uses a fixed value 0 for the parameter passedCount in method1 in C1. There is also a SecureRandom object for generating salt for password-based encryption.

Since none of the reported misuses are applicable in the provided Java code, an optimized list is the same as the provided JSON. The list contains no unnecessary elements.

### Optimized Misuse JSON
<no optimized list as all the reported items in the json are false positives in the given code.>

The reported misuses did not apply to the given Java code. It seems that the reported misuses are for other parts of the codebase that are not provided. To find correct potential misuses of cryptographic API the related parts of the Java code needs to be checked.

In conclusion, no misuses were observed in the given code. Thus, the original JSON provided was considered as its optimized list.

```json
[
    {
        "misuse_category": "Noisy Code",
        "vulnerable_method": "L1",
        "vulnet_code": "new C1(0)",
        "description": "A constructor of class L1 uses hardcoded value for parameter count. The constructor of class C1 expects a variable, but hardcoded value has been passed. This could be considered as noise.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding a fixed number for the parameter, consider using a variable to make the code more flexible and noise less."
    }
]
```
This JSON represents optimized misuse list, since the only reported misuse doesn't occur in the provided java code.

For future reporting of misuses, you should be careful about which part of the code you're reporting as it is an important consideration.
