### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt" - This is a false positive because the code provided does not indicate that the hash function is being used for password storage or any other security-sensitive context where a salt would be necessary. Salting is primarily relevant when storing passwords or other secrets to prevent pre-computation attacks like rainbow tables. In the given code, the purpose of hashing is not specified, so we cannot assume that a salt is required.

2. "Insufficient Entropy" - This is a false positive because the misuse is described as an issue with printing the hash, which is not related to entropy. Entropy concerns the randomness and unpredictability of input data or cryptographic keys, not the method of outputting the resulting hash.
