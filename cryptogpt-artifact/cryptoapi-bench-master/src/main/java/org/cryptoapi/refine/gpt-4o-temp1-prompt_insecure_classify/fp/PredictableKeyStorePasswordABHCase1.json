### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - **Reason:** The code cited in this misuse report, "new String(keyBytes).toCharArray()", refers to transforming the byte array generated from the password into a character array for use as a KeyStore password. While the original password generation method is flawed, this transformation step itself is not inherently related to encryption strength as described. The underlying issue lies with how the password is initially generated, which overlaps with the previously identified misuse of using `random.ints()`.
