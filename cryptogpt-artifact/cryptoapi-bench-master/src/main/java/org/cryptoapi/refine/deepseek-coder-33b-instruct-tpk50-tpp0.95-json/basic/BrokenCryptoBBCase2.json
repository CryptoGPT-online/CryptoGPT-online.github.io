    "description": "This code creates a new random key for each encryption/decryption operation, which makes the encryption and decryption useless as the same key is used for encryption and decryption. In real-world scenarios, the same key must be used for encryption and decryption. This can be solved by reusing the same key for each operation.",

    "description": "Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, now considered to be insecure. It's not approved for federal government use or for use in mission-critical applications. It uses a fixed block size of 64 bits and a variable key size from 32 to 448 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using stronger encryption algorithms such as AES, RSA, or the Twofish algorithm instead of Blowfish. You can use a 256-bit key for AES and RSA."
