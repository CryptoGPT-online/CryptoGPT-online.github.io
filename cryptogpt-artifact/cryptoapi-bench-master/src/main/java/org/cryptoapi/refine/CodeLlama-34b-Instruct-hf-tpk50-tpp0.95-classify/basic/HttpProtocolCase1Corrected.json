{
"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "String url = \"https://www.google.com\";",
"description": "The URL is hardcoded, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and configurable URL instead, such as a variable that can be set at runtime."
}
]
} {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
"description": "The `URL` constructor uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, specifically the MD5 hash algorithm, which is known to be weak and should not be used in new code. Instead, use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256.",
"recommendation": "Replace `new URL(url)` with `new URL(url, 42)` to use a secure hash algorithm. Additionally, consider using the `HttpUrlConnection` class instead of the `URL` class to make HTTP requests, as it provides more control over the SSL/TLS handshake."

"description": "The URL is hardcoded, which means that it is not configurable and cannot be changed without modifying the code.",
"recommendation": "Use a configuration file or environment variables to store the URL and provide a mechanism for changing it without modifying the code."
