 Here is the optimized misuse JSON list:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "new C5(\"RC2\")",
    "description": "The use of the RC2 algorithm is insecure and should not be used due to its vulnerability to cryptanalysis.",
    "recommendation": "Replace RC2 with a secure algorithm such as AES."
  }
]
```
Note that the remaining misuse is related to the use of the RC2 algorithm, which is considered to be a broken crypto algorithm and should not be used. The other misuses in the list are not applicable and should be removed.
