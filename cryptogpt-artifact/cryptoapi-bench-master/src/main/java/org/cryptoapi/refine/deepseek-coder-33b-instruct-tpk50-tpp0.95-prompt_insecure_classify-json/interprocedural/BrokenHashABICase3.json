## False Positive Misuse ##

None of the misuses reported in the JSON format seem to be false positives. All of them are clearly misuses of cryptographic API that could lead to serious vulnerabilities if not properly handled.

## Optimized Misuse JSON ##

```json
[
    {
        "misuse_category": "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The code is using the MD4 cryptographic hash algorithm, which is considered weak and broken.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
```
