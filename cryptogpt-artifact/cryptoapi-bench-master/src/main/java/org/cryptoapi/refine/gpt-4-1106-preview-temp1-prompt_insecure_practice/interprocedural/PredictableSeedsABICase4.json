### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse related to "Insecure Use of Randomness" where the vulnerable code is `int v = sr.nextInt();` is a false positive. The issue is not with the method `nextInt()` itself, but with the seeding of the `SecureRandom` instance. If the `SecureRandom` instance is seeded properly, then `nextInt()` will produce cryptographically strong random numbers.

2. The misuse related to "Usage of Static Seed Array" where the vulnerable code is `private static char[] SEED;` is a false positive. The static nature of the `SEED` array is not directly a security issue. The problem arises from the predictable content of the `SEED` array, not its static declaration.

3. The misuse related to "Static Use of Seed" where the vulnerable code is `private static char[] SEED;` is a false positive for the same reason as above. The static declaration is not the issue; the predictable content is.

4. The misuse related to "Broken Crypto Primitive" where the vulnerable code is `new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())})` is a false positive. The issue is not with the use of a single byte as the seed (which is indeed a problem), but rather with the incorrect conversion of the seed from a char array to a byte array, which would result in a runtime exception and not a weak cryptographic primitive.
