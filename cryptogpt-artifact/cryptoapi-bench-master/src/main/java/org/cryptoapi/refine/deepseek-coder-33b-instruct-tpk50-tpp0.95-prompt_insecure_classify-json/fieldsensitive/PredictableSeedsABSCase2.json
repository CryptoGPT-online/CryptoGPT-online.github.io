### False Positive Misuse ###

There are no false positives as the code in both cases are misusing SecureRandom by passing the same seed each time. In the first case, even though the variable passedSeed is initialized with the passed seed value, it is immediately reassigned to defSeed, thus defeating the purpose of having a dynamic seed. In the second case, the passedSeed is directly used as the seed for SecureRandom, which makes it predictable.

        "description": "SecureRandom is being initialized with a predictable seed value. This could potentially result in predictable randomness.",
        "recommendation": "Use a statically initialized SecureRandom instance instead of initializing it with the passedSeed parameter. This would ensure a new random number is generated each time the method is called."
