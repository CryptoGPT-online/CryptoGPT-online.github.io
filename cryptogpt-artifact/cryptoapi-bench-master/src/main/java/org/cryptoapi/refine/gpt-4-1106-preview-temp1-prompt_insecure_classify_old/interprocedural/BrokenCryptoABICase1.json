### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuses related to the use of insufficiently random values (`CWE-330`) are arguably false positives since Java's `KeyGenerator` by default utilizes a secure random number generator. Consequently, unless there's reason to believe the default is insufficient for the application context, it's reasonable to consider those entries as false positives and exclude them from the list of issues.

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered insecure due to its small key size of 56 bits, which can be brute-forced with today's computing power. Additionally, ECB mode does not provide serious message confidentiality, as identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to identical ciphertext blocks, thus it does not hide data patterns well.",
        "recommendation": "Use more secure algorithms like AES with a key size of at least 128 bits and a secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\");",
        "description": "The DES algorithm provides inadequate encryption strength due to its 56-bit key size, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use stronger key generation algorithms like AES with larger key sizes, such as 128, 192, or 256 bits."
