[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is not properly seeded, which may result in predictable or weak randomness. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as the ability for an attacker to guess or brute-force keys or other sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is properly seeded with a strong source of entropy, such as `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_method": "String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The encryption key is generated using a hardcoded value, which makes it easy for an attacker to obtain. This can lead to the compromise of encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the encryption key using a more secure method, such as a key derivation function (KDF) that takes a user-provided password or passphrase as input."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The encryption key is only 16 bytes long, which is not sufficient for AES encryption. This can lead to weak encryption that is vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a longer key length, such as 256 bits (32 bytes), for AES encryption."
