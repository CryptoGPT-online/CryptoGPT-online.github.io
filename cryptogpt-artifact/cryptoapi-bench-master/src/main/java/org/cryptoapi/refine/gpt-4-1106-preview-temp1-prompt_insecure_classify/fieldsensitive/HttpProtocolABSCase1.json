### False Positive Misuse ###

Based on the Java code you've provided, it does not appear to include any cryptographic API usage at all. Since no cryptographic methods or APIs are used within the given classes `H1` and `C1`, there cannot be any cryptographic API misuses. 

The provided code is concerned with URL handling and does not include any encryption, decryption, hashing, or any other form of cryptographic operations. Hence, all the misuse reports that were initially provided as empty JSON arrays (`[]`) are accurate because there are indeed no cryptographic misuses to report.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

The misuse lists are already optimized since they all accurately reflect that there are no cryptographic API misuses present in the provided code. The finalized misuse lists remain as empty JSON arrays, signifying no issues:
