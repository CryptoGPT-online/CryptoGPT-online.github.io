### False Positive Misuse ###

The issue reported regarding the "key length of 16" should be considered a potential false positive based on the context. The code specifies `keyLength = 16`, which is interpreted in bytes, equating to 128 bits. For many encryption standards, 128 bits is a sufficient key length for security, implying the given key length is adequate when understood as bytes. Thus, the relevant misuse report regarding "Inadequate Encryption Strength" is incorrect in this context. Assuming the code is operating under this interpretation, this misuse is a false positive.
