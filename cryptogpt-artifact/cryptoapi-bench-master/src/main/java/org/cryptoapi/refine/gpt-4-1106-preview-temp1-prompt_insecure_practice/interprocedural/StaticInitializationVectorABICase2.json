### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Improper Initialization" is a false positive because the code does specify the mode and padding as "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" when creating the `Cipher` instance. The concern that 'AES' will default to 'AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding' is unfounded in this context.

2. "Poor Error Handling" is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse. While it is a good practice to handle exceptions properly, it is not directly related to the misuse of cryptographic APIs.
