### False Positive Misuse ###

The reported misuse CWE-330: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values" regarding not specifying a secure random number generator when using `KeyGenerator` and the generated key with `keyGen.generateKey()` is a false positive in this context because the `KeyGenerator` does not require a `SecureRandom` instance to be explicitly passed for key generation. The `KeyGenerator` is designed to use a default secure random source. However, specifying a `SecureRandom` is a measure for ensuring higher security, it is not strictly a misuse, but rather a best practice recommendation.
