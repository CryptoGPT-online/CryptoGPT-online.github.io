### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse**: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   - **Vulnerable Code**: `keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16); SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");`
   - **Reason**: The concern regarding the encryption strength is primarily due to how `defaultKey` is generated rather than the use of `Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);` itself. The actual method of truncating or expanding the byte array to meet the AES key length requirement is standard practice, and the remaining concern is inherently tied to the source of the key material, which is already covered under CWE-330.
