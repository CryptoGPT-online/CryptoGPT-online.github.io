"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm to generate a secret key, which is a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. AES is a widely used and secure algorithm, but it should be used with a proper key size, which is not the case in this code.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure key generation algorithm, such as AES-256, and make sure to use a proper key size."
