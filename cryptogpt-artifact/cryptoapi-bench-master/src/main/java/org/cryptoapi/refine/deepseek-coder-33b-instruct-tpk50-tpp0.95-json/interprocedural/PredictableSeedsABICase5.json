        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
        "description": "The use of a small seed for random number generation may cause security risks as it may not provide sufficient randomness, making the output vulnerable to predictability. A byte array of 8 or more bytes should be used as seed for secure random number generation.",
        "recommendation": "Use a byte array of 8 or more bytes as seed for secure random number generation. For example, you can use SecureRandom.getSeed() method to generate a seed byte array."
