    "vulnerable_code": "String type = \"JKS\";",
    "description": "The use of \"JKS\" as the type for KeyStore.getInstance() is susceptible to CWE-327. JKS is considered an outdated and less secure cryptographic algorithm.",

    "description": "The use of random.ints() to generate a key is not a secure method for generating cryptographic keys. It does not provide sufficient entropy, making the generated key potentially weak and easily guessable.",

    "recommendation": "Perform proper validation of the server's certificate before loading the keystore. This includes verifying the certificate chain, checking the validity period, and checking for any certificate revocations."
