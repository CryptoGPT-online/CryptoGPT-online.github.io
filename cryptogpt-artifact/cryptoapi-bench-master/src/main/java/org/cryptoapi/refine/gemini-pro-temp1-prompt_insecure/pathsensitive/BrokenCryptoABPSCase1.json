### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse**: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
   - **Vulnerable code**: Cipher cipher = cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
   - **Explanation**: The use of DES is not considered a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. While DES is an older algorithm, it is still widely used and considered secure when used with appropriate key lengths.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
1. **Misuse category**: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   - **Vulnerable method**: Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding")
   - **Vulnerable code**: Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
   - **Description**: The DES algorithm uses a 56-bit key, which is considered insecure by today's standards.
   - **Recommendation**: Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a key length of at least 128 bits.
