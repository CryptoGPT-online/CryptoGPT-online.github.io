### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: Trusting All Certificates (CWE-295)**
   - Reason: The code uses `https://www.google.com`, which implies an HTTPS connection rather than HTTP. Using HTTPS inherently involves SSL/TLS, which in practice signifies that certificates are being verified unless explicitly overridden by a non-secure trust manager. Without specific evidence showing that the SSL context or trust manager is being misconfigured to trust all certificates, this particular misuse is not substantiated as a security issue.

2. **Misuse: Use of HTTP for KeyStore Loading**
   - Reason: The given URL is `https://www.google.com`, which uses HTTPS rather than HTTP. The description incorrectly mentions using HTTP, which is inherently insecure. Using HTTPS addresses the concern of using HTTP for key store loading, as it provides encryption and integrity.
