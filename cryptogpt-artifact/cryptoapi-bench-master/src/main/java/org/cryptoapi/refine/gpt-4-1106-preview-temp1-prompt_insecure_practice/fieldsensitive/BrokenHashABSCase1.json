### False Positive Misuse ###

1. "Use of MessageDigest for Encryption" - This is a false positive because the `encrypt` method is indeed using `MessageDigest` for hashing, not encryption, despite the misleading method name.
2. "Potential Key Disclosure" - This is a false positive because there is no encryption key involved in the hashing process.
3. "Unnecessary Parameter" - This is a false positive because the `passedAlgo` parameter is used to allow the selection of a different algorithm if it is not empty.
4. "No Data Validation" - This is a false positive in the context of cryptographic API misuse. While input validation is a good practice, it is not directly related to the cryptographic operation.
5. "Invalid Cryptographic Operation" - This is a false positive because the code is not attempting to perform encryption; it is hashing, despite the method name suggesting otherwise.
