### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse reports stating "Inadequate Key Length" or "Insufficient Key Length" are false positives. The code specifies `int keyLength = 16;` which is likely intended to be 16 bytes (128 bits), not 16 bits. This is a common misunderstanding since the `PBEKeySpec` constructor expects the key length in bits, and 128 bits is a standard key length for AES. However, the misuse reports are correct in suggesting that a key length of 256 bits could be more secure.

2. The misuse reports regarding the "Weak Iteration Count" are context-dependent. While an iteration count of 11010 may be lower than the recommended value of 100,000 or more, it is not inherently insecure. It is a trade-off between security and performance. However, increasing the iteration count would enhance security.

3. The misuse report about "Unused PBEParameterSpec" is not a security issue but rather a code quality issue. It is correct that the `PBEParameterSpec` is not used, but this does not represent a cryptographic API misuse.
