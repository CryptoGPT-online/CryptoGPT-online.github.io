    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code is using the value of the 'crypto' variable to obtain an instance of a cryptographic algorithm. The 'crypto' variable is a character array, and its value can be influenced by an attacker. This can lead to the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a constant value or a secure algorithm obtained from a trusted source instead of using the value of the 'crypto' variable."

    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded value of 'IDEA' as the default cryptographic algorithm. Hardcoding credentials or sensitive information can expose them to unauthorized access or misuse.",
    "recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials or sensitive information. Instead, consider using secure configuration management practices to store and retrieve sensitive information."
