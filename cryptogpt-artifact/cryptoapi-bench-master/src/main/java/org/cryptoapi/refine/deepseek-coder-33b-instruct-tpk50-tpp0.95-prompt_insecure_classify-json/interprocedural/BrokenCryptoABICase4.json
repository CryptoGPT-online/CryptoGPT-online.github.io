After reviewing the code and the provided misuses, it appears that the false positives are:

1. In the "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm." case, the code is actually using the RC2 cipher algorithm. However, this is a misuse because RC2 is considered broken and insecure. It is replaced by AES, which is considered to be secure.

Here's the list of optimized cryptographic API misuses:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The code is using the RC2 cipher algorithm, which is known to be broken and insecure.",
        "recommendation": "Replace RC2 with a secure cipher algorithm such as AES."
    }
]
```

This misuse is detected because the code is using the RC2 cipher algorithm, which is known to be weak and insecure. The recommendation is to replace RC2 with a stronger algorithm like AES.
