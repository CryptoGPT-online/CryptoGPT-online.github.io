 ### False Positive Misuse JSON

Here is the list of false positive misuses:

[
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "defaultKey.getBytes();",
"description": "The code uses the default key generated by SecureRandom, which is not a secure way to generate a key. The key should be generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, and should be a securely random key.",
"recommendation": "Generate the key using a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
"vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints());",
"description": "The code uses a hardcoded key, which is a security risk. The key should be stored securely and not be hardcoded in the source code.",
"recommendation": "Store the key securely and do not hardcode it in the source code."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
"vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
"description": "The code uses a fixed key size of 16 bytes, which is not a secure key size. The key size should be at least 256 bits (32 bytes) to ensure sufficient security.",
"recommendation": "Increase the key size to at least 256 bits (32 bytes)."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\");",
"description": "The code uses the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING algorithm, which is not a secure algorithm. The AES algorithm should be used with the GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) or EAX (Enhanced Authenticated Encryption) mode, which provide better security and authentication.",
"recommendation": "Use the AES algorithm with the GCM or EAX mode."
}

### Optimized Misuse JSON

Here is the list of misuses that are not false positives:

[
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
"description": "The use of AES with a static password, which is insecure and vulnerable to attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random password for the SecretKeySpec."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
"description": "The use of a random key that is not sufficiently random, making it vulnerable to attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random library for generating random numbers."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
"description": "The use of a 16-byte key, which is inadequate for encryption, as it can be easily guessed or brute-forced.",
"recommendation": "Use a key that is at least 256 bits long."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String originalString = \"Testing\";",
"description": "The hardcoded string \"Testing\" is used as the plaintext to be encrypted, which is not secure. Sensitive data should not be stored in plaintext in the code, as it can be easily extracted by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure method to store and retrieve sensitive data, such as using a secure database or a secure storage service."
