 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
"description": "The use of SecureRandom to generate a password is not secure. SecureRandom is not designed to generate passwords and is not suitable for use in this context.",
"recommendation": "Use a suitable password generation algorithm, such as Argon2 or bcrypt, to generate passwords securely."
}

{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
"description": "The use of a hardcoded password is not secure. Passwords should be stored securely and not hardcoded into the code.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure password storage mechanism, such as a password manager, to store passwords securely."
}

{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "String type = 'JKS';",
"description": "The use of JKS as the keystore type is less secure than other keystore types, such as PKCS#12. JKS is vulnerable to a number of attacks, including the use of weak keys and the use of a single passphrase for all keys.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure keystore type, such as PKCS#12, and use a strong password for the passphrase."
}

{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints());",
"description": "The use of the ints() method of the SecureRandom class is not sufficient for generating a password. The ints() method only generates pseudo-random integers, which are not secure for use as a password.",
"recommendation": "Use a suitable password generation algorithm, such as Argon2 or bcrypt, to generate passwords securely."
