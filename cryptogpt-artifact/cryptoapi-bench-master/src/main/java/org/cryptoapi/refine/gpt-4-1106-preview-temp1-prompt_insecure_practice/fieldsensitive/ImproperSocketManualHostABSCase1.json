### False Positive Misuse ###

The provided code does not show any misuse related to "Insecure Error Handling" as the method `encrypt` is not handling any SSL/TLS exceptions directly. It is simply declared to throw `IOException`, which is a common practice for I/O operations in Java. Without additional context or implementation details showing improper handling of SSL/TLS exceptions, this cannot be considered a misuse.
