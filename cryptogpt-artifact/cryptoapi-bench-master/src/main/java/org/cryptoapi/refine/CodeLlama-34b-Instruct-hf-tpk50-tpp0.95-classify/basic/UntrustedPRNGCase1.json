        "description": "The Random class in Java is a pseudorandom number generator, which means that it does not produce true random numbers, but rather a deterministic sequence of numbers that appears to be random. While it is true that the Random class may not meet the requirements for cryptographic use, it is not necessarily the case that it is not secure for generating random numbers. In this example, the Random class is being used to generate a random number, but it is not being seeded with a secure random value, which means that it is not truly random.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as the SecureRandom class, to generate random numbers for security-related purposes. Also, make sure to seed the secure random number generator with a high-entropy seed."
