### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Use of Default Key Generation**:
   - **False Positive Reason**: The default key generation is relevant only to the chosen algorithm's characteristics. In this case, since DES is inherently insecure, the concern should focus on the algorithm's weakness rather than the explicit key size not being set because specifying a larger key size is generally futile for DES. Any valid key size would still be insecure due to the algorithm itself.

2. **Predictable Cryptographic Algorithm**:
   - **False Positive Reason**: The issue mentioned regarding the predictability concerns the misuse of DES, which is already covered under the "Broken Crypto Algorithm". Adding further focus on key generation predictability is redundant since it won't enhance security given DES's inherent weaknesses.
