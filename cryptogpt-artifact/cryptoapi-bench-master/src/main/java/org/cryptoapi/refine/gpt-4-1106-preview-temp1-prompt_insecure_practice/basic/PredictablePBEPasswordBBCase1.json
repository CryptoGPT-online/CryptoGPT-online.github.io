### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The misuse "Insufficient Salt Size" is a false positive. The code correctly initializes a byte array of size 16, which is 128 bits, not 16 bits as the misuse suggests. This is the recommended size for a salt in cryptographic operations.

The optimized list includes the most relevant and accurate misuses based on the provided code. It corrects the false positive regarding the salt size and consolidates similar issues regarding hardcoded secrets and key length inadequacy. It also emphasizes the importance of specifying the encryption algorithm and using a sufficient iteration count.
