### False Positive Misuse ###
1. The misuse described in the "Insufficient Randomness in Cryptography" is not a false positive. In this code, the KeyGenerator class is being used to generate an AES key, and it's critical to use a secure random number generator (SecureRandom) to ensure that the key is not predictable and therefore secure. However, the usage of the default random number generator in the KeyGenerator constructor is flagged as potentially insecure.

2. The misuse in "ECB Mode" is not a false positive. While ECB mode might not be as secure as other modes, it may be acceptable for some use-cases. It is critical to consider the specific requirements of the system in which this code will be used.

    "description": "The code is using the Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode of operation in AES. ECB mode is not secure and should not be used due to the possibility of pattern analysis if the encrypted data has predictable patterns. In ECB mode, the same input will always produce the same output.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a different mode of operation in AES such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). CBC will add an extra security by XORing each block of data with the ciphertext of the previous block. GCM is an authenticated mode which includes an integrity check."
