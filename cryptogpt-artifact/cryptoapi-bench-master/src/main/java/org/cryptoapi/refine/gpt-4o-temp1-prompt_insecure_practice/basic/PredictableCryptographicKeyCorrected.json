### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse: Static Key Size**
   - **Vulnerable Code:** `keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);`
   - **Reason:** The operation of resizing a byte array to a specific length (e.g., 16 bytes) is standard when preparing a key for a fixed-length encryption algorithm such as AES, which requires a key of certain length. The mention here seems more about ensuring the derived key has sufficient entropy, but it is not directly related to static key size misuse.
