### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Use of Algorithm with Specified Key Length (Susceptible to Collision)**
    - **Reason**: The misuse flags the absence of a specified key length that might lead to an insecure default, but this is not directly applicable in this context because RC2 itself is identified as a weak algorithm. Specifying a key length does not mitigate the insecurity of using RC2, making this consideration irrelevant until a secure algorithm is chosen.

2. **Reliance on Unvalidated/Unpurified Input Data**
    - **Reason**: The misuse indicates concerns about unvalidated input potentially introducing security issues. However, the use of RC2 is determined at compile-time within the `main` method as a constant literal, `"RC2"`. Therefore, the input isn't externally controlled and doesn't represent a dynamic or runtime security risk in this context.
