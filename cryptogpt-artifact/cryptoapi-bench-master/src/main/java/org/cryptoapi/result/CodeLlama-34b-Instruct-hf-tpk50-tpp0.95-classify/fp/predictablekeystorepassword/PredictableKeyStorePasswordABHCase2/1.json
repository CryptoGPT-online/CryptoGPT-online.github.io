"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
"description": "The `KeyStore.getInstance(type)` method is used to obtain a `KeyStore` instance for the specified type. However, the `type` parameter is not verified, which means that an attacker can potentially specify a weaker algorithm than intended, leading to a potential downgrade attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm for key storage, such as AES or RSA, and validate the `type` parameter to ensure that it is a supported and secure algorithm."
