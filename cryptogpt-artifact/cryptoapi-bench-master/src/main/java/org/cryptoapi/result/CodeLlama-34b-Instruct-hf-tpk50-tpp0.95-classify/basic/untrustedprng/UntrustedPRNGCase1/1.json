        "description": "The Random class in Java uses a linear congruential generator, which is not a secure source of randomness. It can be used to generate predictable sequences of numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker to guess the next value. In this example, the randomGenerator object is used to generate a sequence of numbers, which can be predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, instead of the Random class."
