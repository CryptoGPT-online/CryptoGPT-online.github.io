 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(crypto)", "description": "The algorithm used for encryption, RC4, is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. It is no longer considered secure and should not be used for any purpose.", "recommendation": "Use a secure and recommended encryption algorithm such as AES, GCM or ChaCha20."},
{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "toCharArray()", "description": "The toCharArray() method is used to convert a string to an array of characters, but it does not provide enough randomness to generate secure cryptographic keys. It is recommended to use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate random keys.", "recommendation": "Use a CSPRNG such as SecureRandom to generate secure cryptographic keys."},
{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance()", "description": "The KeyGenerator.getInstance() method is used to generate a symmetric key, but the strength of the key is not explicitly specified. It is recommended to use a secure and recommended encryption algorithm such as AES, GCM or ChaCha20, with a key length of at least 128 bits.", "recommendation": "Use a secure and recommended encryption algorithm with a key length of at least 128 bits."},
{"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials", "vulnerable_code": "DEFAULT_CRYPTO", "description": "The DEFAULT_CRYPTO constant is used to store a hardcoded cryptographic algorithm, which can be easily discovered by an attacker. It is recommended to avoid hardcoding sensitive information such as cryptographic algorithms, as it can be vulnerable to attacks.", "recommendation": "Do not hardcode sensitive information such as cryptographic algorithms, instead use a secure and recommended encryption algorithm with a key length of at least 128 bits."}
