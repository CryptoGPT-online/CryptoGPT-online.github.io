    "description": "This code always returns true, which means that any hostname will be accepted as valid, regardless of whether it matches the hostname in the certificate presented by the server. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate server and intercept communications between the application and the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that checks the hostname in the certificate against the hostname of the server that the application is connecting to."
