"description": "The provided crypto algorithm 'RC4' is broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purpose. It is vulnerable to attacks and should be replaced with a secure algorithm such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the 'RC4' algorithm with a secure algorithm such as AES. Also, make sure to use a secure key generation method and follow best practices for cryptographic key management."
