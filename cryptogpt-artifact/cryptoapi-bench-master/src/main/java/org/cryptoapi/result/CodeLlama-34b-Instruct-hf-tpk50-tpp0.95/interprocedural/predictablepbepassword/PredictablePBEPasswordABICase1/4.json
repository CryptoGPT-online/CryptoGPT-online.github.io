"description": "The PBEKeySpec is using a fixed iteration count of 11010, which is too low for secure key derivation. This can be easily brute-forced by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a variable iteration count or a dynamic one that is determined by a server-side secret, so that each user's password has a unique iteration count. This can greatly increase the computational cost of password cracking."
