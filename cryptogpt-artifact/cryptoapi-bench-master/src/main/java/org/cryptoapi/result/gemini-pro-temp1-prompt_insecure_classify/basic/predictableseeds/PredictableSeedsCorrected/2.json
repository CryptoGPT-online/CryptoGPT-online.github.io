    "description": "The SecureRandom object is seeded using its previous output, which can lead to predictable output and compromise the security of the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG) that is seeded with a high-quality entropy source, such as `java.security.SecureRandom` with a seed generated from a hardware random number generator (HRNG) or a strong pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)."
