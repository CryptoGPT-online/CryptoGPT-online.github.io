        "description": "MD5 is used as the cryptographic hashing algorithm. MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use because it is vulnerable to hash collisions. This can lead to security issues where an attacker could generate the same hash with a different input, causing data integrity issues or security bypasses.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
