 "description": "The use of the ECB mode in AES is insecure and may expose data to various attacks. Using ECB mode with a block cipher like AES can reveal patterns in the data and is not recommended for secure communication. Additionally, using PKCS5Padding with AES is not recommended as PKCS#5 padding is for 64-bit block ciphers and AES uses 128-bit blocks.",
 "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode like CBC or GCM with a randomly generated IV for AES encryption. Additionally, use PKCS7Padding instead of PKCS5Padding for AES encryption."}
