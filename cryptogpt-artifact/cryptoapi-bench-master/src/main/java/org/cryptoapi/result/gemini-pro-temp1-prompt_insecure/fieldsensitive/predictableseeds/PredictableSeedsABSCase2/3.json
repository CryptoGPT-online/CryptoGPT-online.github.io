    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with an inadequate seed, making it predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and seed it with a strong seed, such as one generated by `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Alternatively, consider using a more secure random number generator such as `java.security.Provider`."
