 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
"description": "The `PBEParameterSpec` class is vulnerable to denial of service attacks due to the small iteration count and weak key length. The `salt` parameter is only a single byte, which provides very little protection against attacks. Additionally, the `count` parameter is set to a very low value, which makes the algorithm vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a much higher value, such as 100,000 or higher. Use a larger salt, such as a 16-byte array, and generate it randomly for each encryption operation. Consider using a secure, high-strength algorithm such as Argon2 or PBKDF2 instead of PBE."
