        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
        "description": "The Cipher.getInstance() method with crypto as parameter might instantiate an insecure cryptographic object due to the usage of a one-way hash without a salt. This allows for possible vulnerabilities such as hash collisions and dictionary attacks. Moreover, the use of RC2 cipher in the code does not provide any form of security against the known attacks. It's considered obsolete and vulnerable. RC2 should be replaced with a strong authenticated encryption algorithm like AES.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of directly using the crypto value as an argument to Cipher.getInstance(), check it against a whitelist of valid algorithms. For example, AES should be used instead of RC2. Do not use a one-way hash without a salt."
