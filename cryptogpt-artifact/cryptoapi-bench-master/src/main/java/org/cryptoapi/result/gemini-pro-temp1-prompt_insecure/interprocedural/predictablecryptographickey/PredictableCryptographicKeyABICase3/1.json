    "misuse": "CWE-328: Reliance on Key Derivation Function or Pseudo-Random Number Generator Not Designed for Key Derivation",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();",
    "description": "The code directly uses `getBytes()` to convert the password string to a byte array, which is used as the encryption key. This is insecure because the `getBytes()` method is not designed for key derivation and may produce weak and predictable keys.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function, such as `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256`, to generate the encryption key from the password string."
