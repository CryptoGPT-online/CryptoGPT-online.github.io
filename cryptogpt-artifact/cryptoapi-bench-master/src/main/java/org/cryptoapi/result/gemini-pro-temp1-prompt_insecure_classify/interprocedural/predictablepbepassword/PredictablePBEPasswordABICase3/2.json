    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not properly initialized with a strong seed. This can lead to predictable random values, which can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is properly seeded with a strong source of entropy, such as `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows."
