    "description": "The SecureRandom seed is derived from a single byte, which is too small. In most cases, this will create a seed value that is too predictable or weak. The resulting generated random values could be guessed or reproduced.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using a single byte as seed for SecureRandom. Instead, use a longer and more random seed, for example, by using a password derived seed."
