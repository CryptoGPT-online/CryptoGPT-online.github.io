    "description": "The code snippet uses ECB mode for encryption, which is considered insecure because it does not provide serious message confidentiality. It encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks, thus it does not sufficiently hide data patterns.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with a unique initialization vector (IV) for each encryption."

    "description": "The encryption algorithm, mode, and padding scheme are hardcoded and passed to the method 'method1'. This is not directly a security issue, but it might become one if 'crypto' is controlled by an attacker, it is prone to misuse.",
