        "description": "The salt bytes in this code are not generated using a cryptographically strong random number generator, which might make the cryptographic operations weak. The use of hardcoded iteration count (11010) and key length (16) also indicate inadequate randomness, which could weaken the security.",
        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator for generating the salt bytes. Consider using a high iteration count, such as 100000+ for PBKDF2 or bcrypt, and a high key length, such as 256 or above."

        "description": "This code uses PBEKeySpec without specifying the cipher or key OID. It could be susceptible to attacks if the default cipher or key is not secure. It's also using a low iteration count (11010) which could lead to reduced security.",
