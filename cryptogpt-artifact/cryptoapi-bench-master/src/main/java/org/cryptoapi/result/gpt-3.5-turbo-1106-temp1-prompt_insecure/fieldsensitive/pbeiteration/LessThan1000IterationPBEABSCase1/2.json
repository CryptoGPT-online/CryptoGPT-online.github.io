    "description": "The code uses SecureRandom without specifying a specific algorithm. Depending on the environment and the platform, the default algorithm may not provide sufficient cryptographic strength.", 
    "recommendation": "Specify the SecureRandom algorithm explicitly to ensure a sufficient level of cryptographic strength. For example, use 'SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()' to obtain the strongest algorithm available on the platform."}

    "description": "The derivation of parameter spec for Password-Based Encryption (PBE) is incorrect as the iteration count is set to a fixed value directly. This can weaken the security of the encryption keys derived from the password.", 
    "recommendation": "Use a configurable and sufficiently high iteration count for the PBEParameterSpec to enhance the security of key derivation. Consider using a secure key derivation function (KDF) such as PBKDF2 with a high iteration count."}
