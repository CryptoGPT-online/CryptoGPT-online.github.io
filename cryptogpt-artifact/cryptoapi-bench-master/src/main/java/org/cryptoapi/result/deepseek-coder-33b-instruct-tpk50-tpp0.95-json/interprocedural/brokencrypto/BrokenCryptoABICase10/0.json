    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in this code is known to be weak and is therefore insecure for use in real-world applications. Weak algorithms such as IDEA should be avoided as they can be easily broken with modern technology.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger cryptographic algorithm that is currently considered secure. Algorithms like AES or RSA are generally considered secure. Do not use weak algorithms such as IDEA or 3DES for any real-world cryptographic operation."
