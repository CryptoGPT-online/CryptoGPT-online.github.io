This can be exploited by an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator, potentially compromising the security of the system.","recommendation":"Use a secure seed for SecureRandom, such as using the `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` method to get an instance that uses a strong random seed."}]}
