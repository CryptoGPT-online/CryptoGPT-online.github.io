"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "password.toCharArray()",
"description": "The password is generated using a predictable method, which makes it easier for attackers to guess the password. Using a more secure method of generating passwords, such as bcrypt or PBKDF2, would be more secure.",
"recommendation": "Replace the password generation method with a more secure algorithm, such as bcrypt or PBKDF2."
