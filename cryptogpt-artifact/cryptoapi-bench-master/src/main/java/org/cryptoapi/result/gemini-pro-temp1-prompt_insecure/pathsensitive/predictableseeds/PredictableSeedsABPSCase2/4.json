    "description": "The provided seed is not cryptographically secure as it is a fixed and predictable value. This makes it easier for an attacker to guess the generated random values.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (such as `java.security.SecureRandom`) that is seeded with a cryptographically secure random seed."
