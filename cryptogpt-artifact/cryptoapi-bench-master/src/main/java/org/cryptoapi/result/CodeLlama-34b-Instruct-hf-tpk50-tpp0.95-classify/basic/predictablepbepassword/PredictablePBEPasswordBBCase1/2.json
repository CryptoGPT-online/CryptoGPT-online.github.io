"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec",
"description": "The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm in the PBEKeySpec class is vulnerable to attacks, such as brute force or rainbow table attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES or RSA, and a secure key generation method such as PBKDF2 or HKDF."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom()",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is used without proper certificate validation, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure certificate validation method such as SSL/TLS, and use a trusted certificate authority (CA) to validate the certificate."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
"vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
"description": "The PBEKeySpec class uses a fixed iteration count, which makes it vulnerable to attacks such as rainbow table attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a random iteration count or a dynamic number of iterations that is based on the complexity of the password and the hash function being used."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
"vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"saagar\";",
"description": "The defaultKey is hardcoded, which makes it vulnerable to attacks such as static analysis or reverse engineering.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure mechanism such as a password prompt or a secure key store to obtain the password at runtime."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
"vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
"description": "The use of a weak encryption algorithm such as AES-128 is vulnerable to attacks such as brute force or rainbow table attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a strong encryption algorithm such as AES-256 or RSA, and a secure key generation method such as PBKDF2 or HKDF."
