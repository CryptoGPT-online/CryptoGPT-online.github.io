    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in the code is 'RC2', which has been reported to have security issues and is no longer considered secure for encryption or hashing. The algorithm might be compromised or be vulnerable to new attacks due to its age and potential lack of updates. It is strongly recommended to use newer and stronger algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm like 'AES' instead of 'RC2'."
