 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "URL.toCharArray()", "description": "The URL class is designed to represent a URL, but the toCharArray() method is not a secure way to store a URL. It may expose sensitive information, such as authentication credentials, if the URL contains them. A better approach would be to use the toString() method, which returns a string representation of the URL without the sensitive information. ", "recommendation": "Use URL.toString() instead of URL.toCharArray() to store the URL in a secure way."}
