Sure, here is the JSON report of the crypto API misuses in the provided Java code:

```
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "The SHA-1 algorithm is considered cryptographically broken and should not be used for new applications. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two messages that hash to the same value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
  }
]
```

The code is vulnerable to a cryptographic algorithm attack because it uses the SHA-1 algorithm, which is considered cryptographically broken. An attacker could use a collision attack to find two messages that hash to the same value, which could allow them to bypass authentication or integrity checks.

To fix this issue, you should use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. You can do this by changing the line `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA1");` to `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");`.
