  "description": "The iteration count alone may not be sufficient for key derivation, and the salt size should be carefully chosen for proper security.",
  "recommendation": "Use a well-established cryptographic library and consult the best practices for securely deriving keys. Additionally, consider using a purpose-built key derivation function like PBKDF2 with an appropriate number of iterations and a strong cryptographic hash function."}]
