[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");\nbyte[] salt = {b,b};", 
  "description": "The salt value used for encryption is derived from the 'b' variable, which is a single byte obtained from a HashMap. Using only a single byte for the salt reduces the strength of the encryption.", 
  "recommendation": "Generate a cryptographically secure random salt with sufficient length (at least 8 bytes) for the PBEParameterSpec constructor."}]
