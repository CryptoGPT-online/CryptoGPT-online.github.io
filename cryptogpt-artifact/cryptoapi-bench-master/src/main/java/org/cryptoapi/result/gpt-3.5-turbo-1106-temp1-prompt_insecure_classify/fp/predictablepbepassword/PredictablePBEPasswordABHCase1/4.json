[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "byte [] salt = new byte[16];\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);", 
  "description": "The code uses a fixed size and predictable random value for generating the salt, which may make the encryption vulnerable to attacks.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator to generate the salt value. Consider using a larger salt size, such as 128 bits or more, to increase the resistance against attacks."}]
