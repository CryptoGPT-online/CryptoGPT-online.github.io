    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "The salt value is hardcoded as `{(byte) 0xa2}`. This means that the same salt value will be used for all instances of encryption, which makes it easier for an attacker to break the encryption and subsequently compromise the data.",

    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
    "description": "The iteration count `count` is set to a low value (1020). This means that it would be relatively easy for an attacker to brute-force the password and subsequently compromise the data.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value (e.g., 100,000 or more) to make it more difficult for an attacker to brute-force the password."
