    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MD2 algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure. MD2 is vulnerable to collision attacks, making it unsuitable for cryptographic applications. Attackers can easily find two messages that produce the same MD2 hash, allowing them to bypass authentication or integrity checks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD2 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
