    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The seed value for the SecureRandom object is created using a byte array, which is not sufficiently random. This makes it easier for an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated by the SecureRandom object.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating the seed value, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. This method uses a stronger random number generator that is more resistant to attack."
