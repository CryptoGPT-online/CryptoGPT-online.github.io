"description": "The use of the `go` method with the `URL` class is a potential security misuse. The `URL` class is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks, which can allow an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious website.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure URL class, such as `HttpURLConnection`, instead of the `URL` class. This will ensure that the URL is properly sanitized and cannot be exploited for DNS rebinding attacks."
