Sure, here is the JSON report:
```
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length is too short. For AES, the recommended key length is at least 128 bits, but 192 or 256 bits are preferred.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 128 bits, but 192 or 256 bits are preferred."
  },

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not seeded properly, which means that the generated salt will not be truly random.",
    "recommendation": "Seed the `SecureRandom` class with a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG), such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."
