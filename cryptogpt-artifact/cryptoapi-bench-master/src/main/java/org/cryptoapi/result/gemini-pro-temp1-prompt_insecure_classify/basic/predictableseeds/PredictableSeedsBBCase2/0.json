    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed seed value to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance, which makes the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` or `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")`, and avoid using a fixed seed value."
