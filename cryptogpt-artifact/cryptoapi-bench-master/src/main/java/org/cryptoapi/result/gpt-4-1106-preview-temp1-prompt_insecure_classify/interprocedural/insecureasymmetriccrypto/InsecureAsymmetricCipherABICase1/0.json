        "description": "The key size of 1024 bits for RSA is considered weak due to advancements in computational power. It is no longer considered secure for encryption and could be broken by a determined attacker.",
        "recommendation": "Use a larger key size for RSA, such as 2048 or 4096 bits, to ensure adequate encryption strength."
