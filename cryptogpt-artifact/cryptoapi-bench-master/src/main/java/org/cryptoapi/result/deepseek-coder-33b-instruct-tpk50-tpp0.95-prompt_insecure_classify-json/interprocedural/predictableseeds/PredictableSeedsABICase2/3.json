  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
  "description": "The seed is a single byte. A seed of less than 4 bytes may lead to weak random number generation. If an attacker knows the algorithm used for generating the random number and the seed is weak, they could predict or force the random number.",
  "recommendation": "Use a seed of at least 4 bytes to increase the security of the random number generation."
