        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();",
        "description": "The use of `SecureRandom` with a known and predictable seed value is a security vulnerability. The seed value is not random and can be easily predicted, which can lead to a predictable random number generation. This can be exploited by an attacker to predict the output of the random number generation, potentially compromising the security of the system.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of `SecureRandom` with a cryptographically secure random number generation algorithm, such as `Random` or `CryptoRandom`. Use a cryptographically secure seed value, such as a value generated by a cryptographically secure random number generation algorithm or a value derived from a secure randomness source."
