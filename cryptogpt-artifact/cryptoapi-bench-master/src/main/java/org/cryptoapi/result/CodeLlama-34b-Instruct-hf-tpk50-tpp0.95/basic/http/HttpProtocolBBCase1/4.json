"description": "The code uses the `URL` class to construct a URL object, which is vulnerable to attacks that use specially crafted URLs to inject malicious data. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).",
"recommendation": "Use a secure URL parsing library, such as `java.net.URI`, instead of the `URL` class. This library provides a more secure way of parsing URLs and mitigates the risk of security vulnerabilities."
