    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l);",
    "description": "Using the output of `SecureRandom.nextLong()` as the seed for `SecureRandom` is insecure because the output of `SecureRandom.nextLong()` is not cryptographically strong. This means that an attacker could potentially guess the seed and use it to predict future outputs of the `SecureRandom` instance.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the seed for `SecureRandom`. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, avoid reusing the seed across multiple instances of `SecureRandom`."
