"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\");",
"description": "The code uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for new code. It has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks that allow the encryption to be easily broken.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the DES algorithm with a more modern and secure algorithm, such as AES."
