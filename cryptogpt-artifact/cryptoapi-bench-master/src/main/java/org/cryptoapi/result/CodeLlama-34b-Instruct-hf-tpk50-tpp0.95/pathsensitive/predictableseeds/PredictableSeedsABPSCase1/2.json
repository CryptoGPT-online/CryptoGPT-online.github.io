"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random numbers, but the `setSeed` method is not used correctly. The seed should be a secure random number, but here it is set to a predictable value `{ (byte) 100, (byte) 200 }`. This can cause the random number generation to be predictable, which can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number as the seed, or remove the `setSeed` call if it is not necessary."

"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random numbers, but the `nextInt` method is used without a secure hash function. The `nextInt` method returns a pseudorandom integer, but the distribution of the numbers is not secure. A secure hash function, such as SHA-256, should be used to generate the random number.",
