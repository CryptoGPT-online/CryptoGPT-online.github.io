"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
"description": "The code uses the URL constructor to construct a URL object, which may contain a scheme (e.g. https) and a hostname (e.g. www.facebook.com). However, the constructor does not perform any validation on the scheme or hostname, which may result in the creation of a URL object that contains a malicious scheme or hostname. For example, an attacker may be able to create a URL object that points to a malicious website, which could potentially result in a phishing attack or other security vulnerability.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure method of constructing URLs, such as using the URI class and its constructors or the URIBuilder class and its methods."
