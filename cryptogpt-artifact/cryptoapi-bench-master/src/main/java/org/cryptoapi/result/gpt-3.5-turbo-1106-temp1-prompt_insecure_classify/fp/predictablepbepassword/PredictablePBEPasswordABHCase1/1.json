[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());\nbyte [] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");",
"description": "The SecureRandom object is initialized with no seed, which may result in a predictable sequence of random values. Additionally, the usage of random.ints() to generate a default key introduces insufficient randomness.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger source of randomness, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), and generate a secure random key using SecureRandom.generateSeed() or a similar method."}]
