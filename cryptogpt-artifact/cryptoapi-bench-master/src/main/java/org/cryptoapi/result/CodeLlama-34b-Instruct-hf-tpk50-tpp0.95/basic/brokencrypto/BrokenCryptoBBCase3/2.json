"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("RC4");",
"description": "The code uses the RC4 algorithm, which is a broken and insecure algorithm. It is not recommended to use this algorithm for any purpose, as it has known vulnerabilities and is not considered secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, and ensure that the key is generated securely."
