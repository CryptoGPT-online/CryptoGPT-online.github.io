byte[] salt = new byte[32];
random.nextBytes(salt);
```

Description: The random number generator (SecureRandom) is seeded from /dev/random or a similar system-dependent source, which is then used to generate a salt for a PBEParameterSpec. However, this could cause a security weakness as the salt is created using a system-dependent source of randomness.

Recommendation: It would be better to use a platform-independent source of randomness to create the salt. For example, use the SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() method if it's available to use the /dev/urandom source of randomness. Otherwise, use the SecureRandom.getInstance() method to get a source of randomness from the system's default source. This would ensure a more secure source of randomness.
