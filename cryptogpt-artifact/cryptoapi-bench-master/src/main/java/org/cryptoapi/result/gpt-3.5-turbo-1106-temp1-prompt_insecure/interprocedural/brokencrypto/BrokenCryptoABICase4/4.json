 "description": "Key generation using KeyGenerator.generateKey() does not allow setting a specific seed or providing custom entropy, which can lead to insecure or predictable key generation.",
 "recommendation": "Use a more secure and flexible method for generating cryptographic keys, such as using a SecureRandom to generate a random seed and then using that seed with a KeyGenerator initialized with custom entropy via the SecureRandom."}
