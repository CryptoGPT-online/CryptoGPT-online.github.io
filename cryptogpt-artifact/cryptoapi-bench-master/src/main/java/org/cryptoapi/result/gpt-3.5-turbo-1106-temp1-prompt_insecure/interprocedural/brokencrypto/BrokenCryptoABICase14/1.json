 "description": "The KeyGenerator.getInstance() method is being used with the algorithm obtained from the user input, which can lead to the use of insecure or broken cryptographic algorithms.",
 "recommendation": "Do not use user input to directly specify cryptographic algorithms. Instead, use a predetermined set of secure algorithms."}
