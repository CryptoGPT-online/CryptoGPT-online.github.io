[{"misuse": "Cryptographic Weakness", 
  "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
  "description": "The PBEParameterSpec is being initialized with a static and hard-coded salt and iteration count. Using static and hard-coded values for salt and iteration count reduces the strength of the encryption and makes it more vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
  "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a unique salt for each encryption, and to use a high iteration count (e.g., at least 10,000) to increase the computational cost of the encryption process."}]
