        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
        "description": "The method 'ints()' of SecureRandom returns an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom int values. When transforming this stream to a String without a well-defined range, it may lead to an insecure and non-repeatable password generation pattern.",
