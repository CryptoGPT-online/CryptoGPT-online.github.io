    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\"); if(choice>1) cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses ECB mode of AES encryption when the choice variable is 1 or less. ECB mode is vulnerable to many attacks due to its deterministic nature and lack of data integrity protection.",
    "recommendation": "Always use secure encryption modes like CBC or GCM, which provide confidentiality and data integrity. Avoid using ECB mode for encryption."
