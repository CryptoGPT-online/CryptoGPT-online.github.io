"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C1.encrypt() method uses SHA1 algorithm for encryption, which is broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes",
"description": "The C1.encrypt() method is using the SHA1 algorithm for encryption, which is a broken and insecure algorithm. SHA1 is not suitable for cryptographic purposes and should not be used to encrypt sensitive data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or RSA, for encryption instead of SHA1."
