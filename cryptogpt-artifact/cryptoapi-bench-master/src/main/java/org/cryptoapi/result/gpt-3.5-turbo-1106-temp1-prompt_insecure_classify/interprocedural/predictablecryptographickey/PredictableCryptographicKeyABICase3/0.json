    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses a weak encryption key by using the default key value and truncating the key to a fixed length of 16 bytes. This reduces the encryption strength and makes it easier for an attacker to guess the key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and random key for encryption. Ensure that the key has sufficient length for the chosen encryption algorithm. Consider using a key derivation function like PBKDF2 to derive a key from a password or passphrase."
