    "description": "The code uses a weak KDF, PBEKeySpec, with a low iteration count (11010) and a short key length (16 bytes). This makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password and compromise the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger KDF, such as PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256, with a higher iteration count (at least 100,000) and a longer key length (at least 32 bytes)."
