"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",

"description": "The method uses AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding, which is a weak encryption algorithm. Attackers may be able to use weaknesses in the algorithm to break the encryption and access the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES/GCM/NoPadding, and make sure to use the latest version of the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files."

"misuse": "Insecure Key Derivation",
"vulnerable_code": "Co.method1()",
"description": "The method derives the encryption key from the user-provided key, which may not be secure. If the user-provided key is weak or insecure, an attacker may be able to guess the key and access the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or Argon2, to derive the encryption key from the user-provided key."

"misuse": "Insecure Key Storage",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.getKey()",
"description": "The method stores the encryption key in a static variable, which may not be secure. If an attacker gains access to the running Java process, they may be able to extract the encryption key and access the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Do not store the encryption key in a static variable. Instead, generate a new key for each encryption operation and do not store it."

"misuse": "Insecure Random Number Generation",
"vulnerable_code": "Co.method1()",
"description": "The method uses the default random number generator of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which may not be secure. If an attacker is able to predict the random numbers generated, they may be able to guess the encryption key and access the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the initialization vector for the encryption."
