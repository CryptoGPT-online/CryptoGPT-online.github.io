    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The code uses a constant seed value (`DEFAULT_SEED`) to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and defeats the purpose of using a secure random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator that is seeded with a truly random source, such as `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."
