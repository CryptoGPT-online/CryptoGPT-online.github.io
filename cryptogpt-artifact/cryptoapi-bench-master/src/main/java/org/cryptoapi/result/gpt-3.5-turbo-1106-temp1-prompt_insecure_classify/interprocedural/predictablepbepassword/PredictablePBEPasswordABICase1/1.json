    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The PBEKeySpec class is used to derive a key from a password. However, the iteration count and key length used in this code are very low and may result in a weak key. Additionally, the salt used is generated using a standard SecureRandom object, which may not provide sufficient randomness.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count and key length to ensure a stronger key. Use a more secure method to generate the salt, such as a dedicated salt generator."
