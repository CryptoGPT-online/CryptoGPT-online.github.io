The code uses the PBEKeySpec class to generate a password-based encryption (PBE) key. However, it uses a fixed iteration count and key length, which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. An attacker can try different passwords with the same salt and iteration count until they find the correct one.

To fix this issue, the code should use a key derivation function with a high iteration count and key length. One option is to use PBKDF2 with at least 100,000 iterations and a key length of at least 256 bits.
