        "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());\nbyte [] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");",
        "description": "In this code snippet, a random integer is converted to a string and then to bytes. The key is hard-coded, meaning that it is not randomly generated, which is not secure. In a production environment, keys should be generated randomly to add an extra layer of security.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this issue, consider using a secure random number generator to generate your keys. For example, instead of using `SecureRandom.ints()`, you could use `SecureRandom.nextBytes()` to generate your key."
