The first two misuse reports are false positives.

The first report is incorrect because AES is not the only option. The IDEA cipher algorithm is not insecure but it has not been considered secure anymore, meaning it should not be used for new systems. For instance, it can be used if backward compatibility with legacy systems is necessary.

The second report is misleading because the program does not use the IDEA cipher algorithm beyond initialization and is not causing any problem. The IDEA algorithm is indeed weak and has been broken, but the program doesn't use the weak algorithm or the broken key, as the key is of a strong type (AES) and the cipher is only used in an initialization context.

The other misuses seem to be true positives based on the provided code. So, the optimized JSON list will only contain the following:

```json
[{
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\")",
    "description": "The IDEA algorithm has been broken and its security has been completely compromised. Instead of IDEA, you should use AES.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'IDEA' with 'AES'."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "description": "The use of AES key with default key size is risky as it might have inadequate encryption strength. AES with 128-bit keys is now considered too weak for many applications.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a key size of 256-bit or higher for AES."
  }
]
```
