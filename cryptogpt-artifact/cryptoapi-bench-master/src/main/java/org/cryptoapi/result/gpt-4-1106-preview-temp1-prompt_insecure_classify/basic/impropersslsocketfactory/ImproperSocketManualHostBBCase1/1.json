    "description": "The code snippet shows the creation of an SSLSocket without any visible certificate validation. If the certificate validation is not properly implemented elsewhere in the application, this could allow man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate validation. Ensure that the SSLSocket is configured to verify the server's certificate chain and the hostname. This can be done by using a custom javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager that implements the necessary checks, or by configuring the socket's SSLParameters with an appropriate EndpointIdentificationAlgorithm."
