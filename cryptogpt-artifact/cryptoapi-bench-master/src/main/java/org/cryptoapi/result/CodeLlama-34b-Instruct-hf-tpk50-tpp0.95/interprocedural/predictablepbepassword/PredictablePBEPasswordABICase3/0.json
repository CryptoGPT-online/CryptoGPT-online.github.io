"description": "The PBEKeySpec is being initialized with a low iteration count (11010) which can lead to a weak key. Also, the salt is being generated randomly, but it is not being stored for future use, which can lead to weaknesses in the key generation process.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a more secure value (e.g. 65536 or more) and store the salt for future use. Additionally, use a secure random number generator (e.g. SecureRandom) to generate the salt."
