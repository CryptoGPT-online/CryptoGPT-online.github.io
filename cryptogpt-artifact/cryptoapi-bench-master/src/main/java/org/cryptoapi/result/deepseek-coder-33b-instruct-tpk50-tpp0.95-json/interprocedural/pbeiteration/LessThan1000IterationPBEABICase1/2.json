    "description": "The iteration count (second parameter of PBEParameterSpec) in PBKDF2 is used to slow down the process of password derivation. The count should be high enough to avoid brute force attacks. The current implementation uses a very low count, which makes the password derivation very fast and vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a minimum of 10000."
