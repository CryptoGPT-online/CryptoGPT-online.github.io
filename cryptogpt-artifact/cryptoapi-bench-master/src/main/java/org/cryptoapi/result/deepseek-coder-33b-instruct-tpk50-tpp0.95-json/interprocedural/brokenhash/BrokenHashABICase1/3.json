        "description": "SHA1 is a cryptographic hash function which provides a secure hash algorithm. It is not recommended to use SHA1 as it is now considered to be cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use. If you need a secure hash function, you should use SHA-2 or SHA3. Even SHA-2 is also not considered to be secure but it has been widely used as it is still fast.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of 'SHA1', you can use 'SHA-256', 'SHA3-256' or other secure cryptographic hash function like BCrypt for password hashing."
