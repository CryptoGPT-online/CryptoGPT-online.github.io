"description": "The default crypto algorithm used in the code is RC4, which is known to be insecure and should not be used. The code should use a secure algorithm, such as AES, instead.",
"recommendation": "Change the default crypto algorithm to a secure one, such as AES, and update the code to use the new algorithm."
