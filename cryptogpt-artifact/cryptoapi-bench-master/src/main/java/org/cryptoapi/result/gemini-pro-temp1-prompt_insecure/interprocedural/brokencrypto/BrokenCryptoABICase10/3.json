Sure, here is the security analysis of the provided Java code in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static final String DEFAULT_CRYPTO = \"IDEA\";",
    "description": "The code uses the IDEA algorithm for encryption, which is considered cryptographically weak and is not recommended for use.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses the value of the 'crypto' variable to instantiate the Cipher object, which allows an attacker to specify any algorithm they want, including weak ones.",
    "recommendation": "Use a hardcoded, secure algorithm instead of relying on user input."
  }
]
```

In addition to the JSON analysis, there are a couple of minor issues and code smells in the provided Java code:

* The 'crypto' and 'CRYPTO' variables are declared as class variables, which makes them accessible throughout the class. This is not a good practice as it can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker could modify the value of these variables to use a weak encryption algorithm.
* The 'go2()' and 'go3()' methods are declared as private, but they are called from the 'main()' method. This is not a good practice as it makes the code harder to understand and maintain.

I recommend refactoring the code to address these issues and improve its overall security and maintainability.
