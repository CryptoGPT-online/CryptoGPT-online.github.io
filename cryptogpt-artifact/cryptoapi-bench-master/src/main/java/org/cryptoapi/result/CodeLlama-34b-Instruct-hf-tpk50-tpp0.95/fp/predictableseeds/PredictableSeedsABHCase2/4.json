 {"misuse": "Insecure Use of SecureRandom", "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);", "description": "The method `setSeed` uses the provided seed as a starting point for generating random numbers, but it does not perform any validation or sanitization of the seed data, which can lead to predictable random numbers. This can be a problem if the seed data is obtained from an untrusted source, as it could allow an attacker to predict the random numbers generated by the `SecureRandom` instance.", "recommendation": "To fix this issue, consider using a more secure source of randomness, such as `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems, or the `System.getRandom` method in Java 11 and later."}
