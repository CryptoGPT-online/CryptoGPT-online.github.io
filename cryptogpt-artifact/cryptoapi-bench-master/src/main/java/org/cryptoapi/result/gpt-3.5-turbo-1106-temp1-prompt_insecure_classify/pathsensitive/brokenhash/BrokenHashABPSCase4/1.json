    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
    "description": "The code is using SHA-256 algorithm for message digest when the choice is greater than 1. However, the MD2 algorithm is used by default when the choice is not greater than 1. SHA-256 is a more secure algorithm than MD2.",
    "recommendation": "Always use strong and secure cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256 instead of weak and deprecated algorithms like MD2."
