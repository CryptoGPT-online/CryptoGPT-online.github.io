        "vulnerable_code": "public class D1 implements X509TrustManager {...}",
        "description": "The `D1` class implements the `X509TrustManager` interface, but does not properly validate the client or server certificates. The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods always return without throwing a `CertificateException`, effectively trusting any client or server connecting to the system.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods, using a valid certificate authority and checking the certificate's signature and expiration date."
