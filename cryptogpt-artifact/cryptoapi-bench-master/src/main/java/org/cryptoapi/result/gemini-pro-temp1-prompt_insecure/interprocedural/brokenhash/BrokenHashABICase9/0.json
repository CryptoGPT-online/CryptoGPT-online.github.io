    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the SHA-1 algorithm for hashing, which is considered broken and no longer secure. SHA-1 has been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This makes it insecure for use in applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of SHA-1."
