[{"misuse": "Weak Cryptographic Primitive", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
  "description": "The code is using a byte array with a single byte as a seed for initializing SecureRandom, which may not provide sufficient entropy for generating secure random numbers.",
  "recommendation": "Use a stronger source of entropy (e.g., SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()) for initializing SecureRandom."}]
