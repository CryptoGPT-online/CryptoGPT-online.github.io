"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is vulnerable to a broken crypto algorithm, as it uses a fixed iteration count for the PBKDF2 key derivation function. This can lead to a weak key being derived, making it easier for attackers to perform brute-force attacks on the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a random iteration count for each encryption operation, and make sure to use a large enough count to ensure sufficient computational effort for the key derivation. Additionally, consider using a better cryptographic algorithm, such as Argon2 or scrypt."
