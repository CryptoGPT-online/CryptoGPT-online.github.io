  "description": "The code uses the setSeed() method to set the seed of the SecureRandom instance, which can lead to insecure randomness if the seed is not truly random or if it's based on a deterministic value. Additionally, the usage of nextBytes() method may not provide adequate randomness if the seed is not properly initialized.", 
  "recommendation": "Avoid using setSeed() unless there's a specific and justified use case. Instead, rely on the default seed generation of the SecureRandom instance. Additionally, ensure that the seed for the SecureRandom instance is based on a truly random source."}]
