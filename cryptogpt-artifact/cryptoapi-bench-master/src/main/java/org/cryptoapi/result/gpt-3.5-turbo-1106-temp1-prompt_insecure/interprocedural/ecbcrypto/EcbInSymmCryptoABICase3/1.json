  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
  "description": "The method Cipher.getInstance(String algorithm) is called with a dynamic algorithm parameter, which can lead to insecure configurations and vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Always use a static and known secure algorithm such as AES/GCM/NoPadding. Avoid using dynamic algorithm parameters."
