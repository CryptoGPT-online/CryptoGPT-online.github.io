It is vulnerable to collisions and can be used to create attacks such as preimage attacks and collision attacks. A stronger algorithm such as SHA256 or SHA512 should be used instead.",

It is vulnerable to being predictable and can be used to create attacks such as side-channel attacks. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead.",
