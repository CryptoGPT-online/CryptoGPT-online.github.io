  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");",
  "description": "The code uses RSA as the cryptographic algorithm for key pair generation. RSA is a widely used algorithm for encryption, but it is considered risky and weak if not used properly. It is recommended to use stronger cryptographic algorithms, such as elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).",
  "recommendation": "Replace \"RSA\" with a stronger cryptographic algorithm, such as \"EC\" (for elliptic curve cryptography), when generating the key pair."
