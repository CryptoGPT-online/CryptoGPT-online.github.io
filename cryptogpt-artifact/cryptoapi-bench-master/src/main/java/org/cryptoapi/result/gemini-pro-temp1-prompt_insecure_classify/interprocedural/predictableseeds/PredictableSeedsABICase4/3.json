    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The code uses a single byte from the `seed` string to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. An attacker could potentially guess the seed value and predict the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) with a sufficient amount of entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate random values."
