    "misuse": "Insufficient Padding of Ciphertext",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The code uses `Arrays.copyOf()` to pad the key to a length of 16 bytes, which is not a secure way to pad a key. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a key that is shorter than 16 bytes and observing the resulting ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS#7 padding, to pad the key to the desired length."
