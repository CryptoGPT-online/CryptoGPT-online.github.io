"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength)",
"description": "The provided code uses PBEKeySpec with a low iteration count, which can lead to a weak password hashing algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 100000 or more, to increase the computational complexity and strength of the password hashing algorithm."
