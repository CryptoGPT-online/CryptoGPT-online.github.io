    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure. MD5 is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that two different inputs can produce the same hash output. This makes it unsuitable for applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the MD5 algorithm with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
