In this code, the `byte[]` array with values `(byte) 100, (byte) 200` is used to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance. This is a weak seed, as it can be easily predicted by an attacker and can result in the generation of predictable random numbers. To fix this issue, a secure random number generator, such as `/dev/urandom`, should be used to generate a truly random seed for the `SecureRandom` instance.
