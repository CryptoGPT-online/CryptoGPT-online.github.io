        "description": "The code is always accepting the certificate if the hostname is 192.168.0.10 regardless of the actual certificate's details. This creates a security risk where any certificate presented by a server with this IP address is blindly trusted, even if it is not valid.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the condition that checks for a specific IP address and rely on proper hostname verification provided by the underlying HostnameVerifier implementation."
