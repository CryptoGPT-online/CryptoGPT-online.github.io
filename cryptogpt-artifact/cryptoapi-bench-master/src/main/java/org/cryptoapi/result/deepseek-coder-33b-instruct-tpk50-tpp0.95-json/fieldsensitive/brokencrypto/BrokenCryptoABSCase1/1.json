    "description": "The 'KeyGenerator.getInstance()' method creates a new key generator for the specified algorithm, in this case 'defaultAlgo'. The problem with this code is that the 'defaultAlgo' could be set by a user, allowing them to specify an insecure algorithm (like 'DES'). DES is considered insecure because it generates keys quickly which can make brute-force attacks feasible. A more secure algorithm would be 'AES'.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, replace 'KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);' with 'KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");'. This will ensure that the generated keys are secure."
