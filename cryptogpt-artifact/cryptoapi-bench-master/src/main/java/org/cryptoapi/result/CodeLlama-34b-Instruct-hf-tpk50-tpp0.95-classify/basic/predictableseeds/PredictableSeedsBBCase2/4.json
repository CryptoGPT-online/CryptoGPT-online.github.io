"description": "The use of a fixed seed for generating random numbers is a broken or risky crypto algorithm, as it does not utilize an unpredictable or uncontrollable randomness source.",
"recommendation": "Replace the fixed seed with a random or unpredictable source of entropy, such as /dev/urandom, System.currentTimeMillis(), or SecureRandom.getSeed(byte[])."}
