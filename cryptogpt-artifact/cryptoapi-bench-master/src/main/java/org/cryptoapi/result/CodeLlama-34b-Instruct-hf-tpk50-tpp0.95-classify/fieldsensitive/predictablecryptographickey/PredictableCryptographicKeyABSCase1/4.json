{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String passKey = P1.getKey(\"pass.key\");",
"description": "The password is hardcoded, which can be easily discovered and used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure mechanism to store and retrieve the password, such as a secure vault or environment variables."

"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "String algoSpec = \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\";",
"description": "The encryption algorithm used is less secure than the recommended AES-GCM algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM, and ensure that the implementation is done correctly."

"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = defkey;",
"description": "The default key is not randomly generated, which can make it easier for attackers to guess the key and gain unauthorized access to the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a randomly generated key, such as a UUID, and ensure that the key is properly protected and secured."

{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");",
"description": "The encryption key is only 16 bytes long, which is too short to provide adequate security.",
"recommendation": "Use a longer encryption key, such as 32 or 64 bytes, and ensure that the key is properly protected and secured."
