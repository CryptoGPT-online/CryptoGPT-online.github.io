    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(url))",
    "description": "The code blindly creates a new URL object using the provided URL string without considering the security level of the protocol used (http or https). It does not perform any validation or check whether the selected protocol is secure or not.",
    "recommendation": "Always ensure that the selected protocol is secure (e.g., https) when working with URLs that involve sensitive data. Consider implementing proper HTTPS validation and verification mechanisms."
