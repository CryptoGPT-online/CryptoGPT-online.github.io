    "description": "The key size for RSA is set to either 1024 or 2048 bits based on the value of 'choice'. However, 1024-bit RSA keys are no longer considered secure and can be broken using modern computing power. Attackers can use various techniques, such as factoring or side-channel attacks, to compromise the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 2048 bits or higher for RSA to ensure adequate encryption strength and protect against potential attacks."
