 {
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "new URL(url.toString())",
"description": "The `URL` class in Java does not perform any validation of the certificate, which can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can intercept the traffic and modify the URL to redirect the user to a malicious website. It is recommended to use a library such as `javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection` to validate the certificate before connecting to the URL.",
"recommendation": "Replace the `new URL(url.toString())` statement with a call to `HttpsURLConnection.connect(URL)` and check the certificate before connecting to the URL."
