Explanation:
The given code snippet is a simple Java program that is primarily creating a URL object from a string containing an HTTPS URL and then printing it out. This code does not involve any cryptographic operations, hence there are no crypto API misuses to report. Since my task is to only focus on security issues related to cryptographic API misuses and this snippet does not include any cryptography, it does not expose any of the vulnerabilities listed in the assignment (CWE-256, 295, 297, 321, 326, 327, 338, 547, 650, 757, 759, 760).
