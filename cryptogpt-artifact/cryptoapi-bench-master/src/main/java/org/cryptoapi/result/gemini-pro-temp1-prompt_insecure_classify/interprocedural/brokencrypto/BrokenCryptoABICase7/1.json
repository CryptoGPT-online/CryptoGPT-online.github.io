    "vulnerable_code": "private static void go2(){CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();}private static void go3(){crypto = CRYPTO;}",
    "description": "The code selects the crypto algorithm dynamically based on user input and defaults to `RC4`, which is a weak and insecure algorithm. An attacker could potentially manipulate the user input to select a weak algorithm, allowing them to decrypt or tamper with sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-256, and avoid using hardcoded or user-supplied values for algorithm selection."
