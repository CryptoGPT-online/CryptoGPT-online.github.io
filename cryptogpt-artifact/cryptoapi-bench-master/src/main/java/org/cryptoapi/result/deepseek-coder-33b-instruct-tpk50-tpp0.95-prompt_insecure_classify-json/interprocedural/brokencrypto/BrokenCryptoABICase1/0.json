    "description": "The code is using the PKCS5 padding scheme, which is weak and considered vulnerable to attacks. It is recommended to use OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) for asymmetric encryption, or PKCS7 padding for block ciphers. Both of these padding schemes provide better security.",
