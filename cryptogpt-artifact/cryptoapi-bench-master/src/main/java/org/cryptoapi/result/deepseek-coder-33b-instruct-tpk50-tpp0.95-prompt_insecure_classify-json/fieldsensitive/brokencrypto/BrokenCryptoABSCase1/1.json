You should consider using AES with a 256-bit key size instead of DES. Also, consider using a more secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM, instead of ECB.

Note: The mode of operation you choose also affects the implementation. You may need to make changes to the encrypt and decrypt methods in your class C2.
