 {"misuse":"Broken Crypto Algorithm","vulnerable_code":"MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")","description":"The use of MD5 for message digest is considered broken and should not be used for security purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily broken.","recommendation":"Use SHA-256 or higher instead of MD5. Also, use a secure password hashing algorithm like BCrypt or Argon2."}
