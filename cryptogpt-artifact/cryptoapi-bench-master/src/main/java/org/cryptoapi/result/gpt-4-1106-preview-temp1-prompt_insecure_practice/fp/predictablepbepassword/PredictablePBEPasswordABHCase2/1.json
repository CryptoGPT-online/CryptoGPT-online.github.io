    "description": "The keyLength variable represents the key length in bits. A value of 16 will result in a key length of only 16 bits which is highly insecure for modern standards. The code should specify an appropriately large key size.",
    "recommendation": "Use a key length of at least 128 bits for AES or similar secure algorithms."

    "description": "While the code snippet itself does not explicitly state which PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm is being used, the fact that keyLength is set to 16 suggests it might be used for an insecure algorithm. Additionally, modern Java PBE algorithms require specifying the algorithm name in PBEKeySpec which is missing here.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure using a secure PBE algorithm like PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 and specify it explicitly. Also, make sure to use an adequate key length."
