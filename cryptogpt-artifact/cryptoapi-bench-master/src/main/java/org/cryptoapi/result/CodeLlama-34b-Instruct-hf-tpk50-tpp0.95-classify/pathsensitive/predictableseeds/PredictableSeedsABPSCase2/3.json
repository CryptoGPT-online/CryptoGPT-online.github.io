"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The code uses a hardcoded array of bytes as the seed for the SecureRandom instance. This can lead to predictable behavior and reduce the security of the cryptographic operations.",
"recommendation": "Use a random and unique seed for each instance of SecureRandom. Consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the seed."
