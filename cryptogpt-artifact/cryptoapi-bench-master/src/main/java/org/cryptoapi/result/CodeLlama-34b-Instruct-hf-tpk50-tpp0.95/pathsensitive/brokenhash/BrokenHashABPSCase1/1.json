"description": "The code uses the SHA1 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
"recommendation": "Replace the SHA1 algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."

"misuse": "Weak Hashing",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.digest()",
"description": "The code uses the digest() method of the MessageDigest class to generate a hash value. However, the digest() method does not provide any security guarantees and is vulnerable to hash collision attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure method of generating hash values, such as the hash_hmac() function."

"misuse": "Insecure Salt",
"vulnerable_code": "String.getBytes()",
"description": "The code uses the getBytes() method of the String class to convert a string to a byte array. However, the getBytes() method uses the default platform encoding, which can be vulnerable to attacks if the encoding is not specified correctly.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure method of converting strings to byte arrays, such as the getBytes(String) method with a specified encoding."
},
{
"misuse": "Insecure Input Handling",
"vulnerable_code": "String name = \"abcdef\";",
"description": "The code defines a string variable without proper input handling. It is vulnerable to injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure method of defining string variables, such as using a prepared statement with bound parameters."
},
{
"misuse": "Insecure Random Number Generation",
"vulnerable_code": "int choice = 2;",
"description": "The code uses a hardcoded integer value for the choice variable, which can be vulnerable to attacks if the value is not properly generated.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure method of generating random numbers, such as the SecureRandom class."
