    "description": "The code uses a constant value (`100`) as the seed for the `SecureRandom` instance. This means that the generated random numbers will be predictable, which can compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a truly random seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate unpredictable random numbers."
