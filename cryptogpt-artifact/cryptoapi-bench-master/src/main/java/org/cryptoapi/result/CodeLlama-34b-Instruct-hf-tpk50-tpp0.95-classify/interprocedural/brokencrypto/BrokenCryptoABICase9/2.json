 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The method 'getInstance' is used with the cryptographic algorithm 'IDEA', which is considered broken and insecure. It should not be used for any cryptographic operations. The vulnerable code is in the method 'go' and the class 'B9'.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the 'IDEA' algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
