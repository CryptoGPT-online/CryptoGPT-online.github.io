"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes)",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is not designed to be used with a user-provided seed. Using a user-provided seed can potentially expose the seed and allow for predictable random number generation.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as Java's built-in SecureRandom class, and do not use a user-provided seed."
