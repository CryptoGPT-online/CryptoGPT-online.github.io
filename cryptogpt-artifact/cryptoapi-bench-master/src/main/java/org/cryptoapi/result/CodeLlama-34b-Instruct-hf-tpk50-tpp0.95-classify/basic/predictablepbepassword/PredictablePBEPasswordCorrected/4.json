        "description": "The code uses the PBEKeySpec class from the Java Security API, which is a risky cryptographic algorithm that is not recommended for use in modern applications. It uses a weak hash function (MD5) and a weak password-based key derivation function (PBKDF1) that can be easily broken using brute force attacks.",
