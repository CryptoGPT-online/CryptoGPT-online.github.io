{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.key() function",
"description": "The key generation algorithm used in the P1.key() function is vulnerable to attack because it uses a low iteration count of 11010. This can be broken using specialized hardware or software, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to crack the password.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a more secure value, such as 100000 or more, to make the key generation algorithm more resistant to attack."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "defaultKey variable",
"description": "The defaultKey variable is set to a hardcoded value of 'saagar', which is not securely generated. This value could potentially be guessed or brute-forced by an attacker, which could compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Generate the defaultKey value using a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to ensure that it is truly random and unpredictable."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "keyLength variable",
"description": "The keyLength variable is set to 16, which is not a secure encryption key length. A longer key length, such as 32 or 64, would be more secure and resistant to attack.",
"recommendation": "Increase the keyLength variable to a more secure value, such as 32 or 64, to make the encryption algorithm more resistant to attack."
