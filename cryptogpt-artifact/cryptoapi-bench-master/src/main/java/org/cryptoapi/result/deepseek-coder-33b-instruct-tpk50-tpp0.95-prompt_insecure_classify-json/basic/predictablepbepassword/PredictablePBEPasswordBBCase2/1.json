  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
  "description": "The provided code uses a SecureRandom instance to generate a salt, which is more secure than using Math.random(). However, for a higher level of security, you could consider using SecureRandomSpi.",
  "recommendation": "You could use the 'SecureRandomSpi' class which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG)."
