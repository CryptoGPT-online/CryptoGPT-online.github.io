[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextInt()", "description": "The code is using the SecureRandom class to generate random bytes for the initialization vector (IV) of the AES cipher. However, the sr.nextInt() method only generates random integers, which may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "Use the sr.nextBytes() method to generate random bytes instead of using sr.nextInt()."}]
