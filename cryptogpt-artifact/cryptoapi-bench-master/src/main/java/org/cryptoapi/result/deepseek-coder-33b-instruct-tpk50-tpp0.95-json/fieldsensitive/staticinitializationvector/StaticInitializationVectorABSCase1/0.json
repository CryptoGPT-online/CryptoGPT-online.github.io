    "description": "The IV (initialization vector) should be a random and unpredictable value for the security of the cryptographic operation. The IV in this code is not random, as it's assigned the value of defIV. This can result in the same IV being used multiple times, which reduces the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a new random IV each time you use the encryption operation. You can use the SecureRandom class to generate a secure random number for the IV."
