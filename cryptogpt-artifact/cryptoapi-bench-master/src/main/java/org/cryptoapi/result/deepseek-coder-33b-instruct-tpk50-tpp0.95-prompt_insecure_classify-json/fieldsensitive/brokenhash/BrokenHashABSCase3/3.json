    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The use of the MessageDigest class is risky because it uses a cryptographic algorithm (hash function) which is known to be weak, like MD4. MD4 has been cryptographically broken and considered weak for use in the generation of random numbers, so it's no longer appropriate for use in the generation of secure hashes. ",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a stronger algorithm, like SHA-256, or another cryptographic hash function."
