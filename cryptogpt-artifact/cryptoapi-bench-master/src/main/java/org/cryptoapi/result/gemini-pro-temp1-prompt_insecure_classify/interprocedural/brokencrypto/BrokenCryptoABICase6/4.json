    "description": "The code uses a statically defined default cryptography algorithm (`DEFAULT_CRYPTO`) without considering the security implications. This makes the application vulnerable to attacks that exploit weak algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm and avoid hardcoding the algorithm choice. Instead, use a configuration mechanism to allow for algorithm selection based on security requirements and algorithm availability."
