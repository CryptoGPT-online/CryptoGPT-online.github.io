 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))", "description": "The code is using the MD4 algorithm, which is a broken algorithm and should not be used. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily forged.", "recommendation": "Replace the MD4 algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."}
