        "description": "The P1.key() method uses a weak iteration count (11010) and a low key length (16) when generating the PBEKeySpec, which can lead to weak encryption and potential attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 100,000 and use a larger key length (e.g. 256) when generating the PBEKeySpec to improve the encryption strength."
