[{"misuse": "Weak Encryption (CWE-326)", 
  "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
  "description": "The iteration count of 1020 for the PBE encryption is too low and could make the system vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 10000 or above, to increase the computational cost of the key derivation function."},
 {"misuse": "Insecure Randomness (CWE-338)", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
  "description": "The usage of SecureRandom without specifying a strong source of randomness may lead to insecure randomness generation.",
  "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to obtain a strong instance of SecureRandom for secure cryptographic operations."}]
