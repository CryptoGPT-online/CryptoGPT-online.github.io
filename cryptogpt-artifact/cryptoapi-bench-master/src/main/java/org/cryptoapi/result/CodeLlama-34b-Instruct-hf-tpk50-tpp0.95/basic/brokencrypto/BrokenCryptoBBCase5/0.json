"description": "The IDEA algorithm is a broken encryption algorithm that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. It should not be used for any purpose, and any existing uses of it should be immediately replaced with a more secure algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the IDEA algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as AES."
