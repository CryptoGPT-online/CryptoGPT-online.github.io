    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "The code uses the default hostname verifier, which only checks if the hostname matches the Common Name (CN) in the server's certificate. This is not a reliable way to verify the identity of the server, as it is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a hostname verifier that checks the certificate chain of the server and ensures that it is signed by a trusted certificate authority."
