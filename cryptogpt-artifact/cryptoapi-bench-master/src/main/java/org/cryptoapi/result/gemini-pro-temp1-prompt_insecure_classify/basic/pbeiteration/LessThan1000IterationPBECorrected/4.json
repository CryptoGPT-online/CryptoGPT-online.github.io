    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\n        byte[] salt = new byte[32];\n        random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a salt for a key derivation function. However, it does not provide a seed to the `SecureRandom` constructor, which means that the generated salt will be weaker and more predictable.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this, a cryptographically secure random number generator should be used, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and it should be seeded with a strong seed value."
