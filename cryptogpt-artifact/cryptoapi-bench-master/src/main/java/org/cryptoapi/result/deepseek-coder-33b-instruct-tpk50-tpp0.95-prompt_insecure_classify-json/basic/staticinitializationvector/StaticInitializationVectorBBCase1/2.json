    "description": "The provided code uses the AES algorithm with a 128-bit key size. Although AES is one of the most secure cryptographic algorithms, its key size of 128 bits is deemed insecure. This is especially true for the ECB mode of operation.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong encryption standard such as AES-256 (with a 256-bit key size) or a more secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM."
