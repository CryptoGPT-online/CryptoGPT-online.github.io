"description": "The use of DES encryption algorithm is insecure, as it has been broken and should not be used in new code. Additionally, the use of ECB mode is not semantically secure, as it does not provide data integrity. AES should be used instead.",
"recommendation": "Use AES encryption algorithm with a secure mode, such as CBC or GCM. Also, make sure to use a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS7Padding."
