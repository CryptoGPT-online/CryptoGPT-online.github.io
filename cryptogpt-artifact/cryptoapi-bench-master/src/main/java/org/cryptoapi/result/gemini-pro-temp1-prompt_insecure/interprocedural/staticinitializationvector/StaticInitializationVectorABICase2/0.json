    "vulnerable_code": "byte[]{Byte.parseByte(String.valueOf(initialization))}",
    "description": "The code is using a key-derivation function (KDF) with insufficient entropy. The KDF is used to generate an initialization vector (IV) for the cipher. The IV is a random value that is used to initialize the cipher. If the IV is not random enough, it can be guessed by an attacker, which would allow them to decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to generate the IV. The KDF should be used with a strong password or passphrase."

    "vulnerable_code": "DEFAULT_INITIALIZATION = \"abcde\"",
    "description": "The code is using a hard-coded initialization vector. This is a security risk because an attacker could guess the IV and decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the IV randomly at runtime. For example, you could use the `SecureRandom` class to generate a random IV."
