"recommendation": "For AES encryption, always use a random and unpredictable IV. AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding mode requires an IV, and the default Cipher.init method does not specify an IV, so it will generate a random one for you. If you need to specify your own IV, you should generate it in a secure way, such as using SecureRandom."
