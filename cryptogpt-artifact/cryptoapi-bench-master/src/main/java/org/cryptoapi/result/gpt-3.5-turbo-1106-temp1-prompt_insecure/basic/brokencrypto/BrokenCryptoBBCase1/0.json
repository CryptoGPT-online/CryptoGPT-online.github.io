 "description": "Using DES for encryption is not considered secure as it has been compromised. ECB mode is also known to be insecure. Using PKCS5Padding does not provide as strong security as more modern padding schemes.", 
 "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES. Also, consider using a more secure mode of operation like CBC or GCM, and use a more modern padding scheme such as PKCS7Padding."}
