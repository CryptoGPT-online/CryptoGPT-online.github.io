    "description": "A weak or non-random pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is used to generate cryptographic keys or nonces. This makes it easier for an attacker to mount a chosen plaintext or ciphertext attack against the system, as the attacker can use the weak or non-random PRNG to generate suitable values.",
