    "description": "The code is using the variable 'crypto' as the algorithm name for the MessageDigest.getInstance() method, which is a risky practice because it allows for the use of potentially insecure cryptographic algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure and widely tested algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) instead of using the value of 'crypto' as the algorithm name."
