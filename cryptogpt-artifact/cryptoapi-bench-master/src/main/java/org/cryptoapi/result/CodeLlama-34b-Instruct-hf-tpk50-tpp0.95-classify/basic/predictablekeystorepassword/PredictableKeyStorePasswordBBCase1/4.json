    "description": "The code uses the `JKS` (Java Key Store) algorithm to load a keystore, which is a less secure algorithm compared to others like `PKCS12` or `BKS`. This may cause issues with negotiating with other systems that use more secure algorithms.",

    "description": "The code uses the `changeit` default password to load the keystore, which is a well-known and easily guessable password. This may allow attackers to easily gain access to the keystore and compromise the security of the system.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unique password to load the keystore, and store it securely to prevent unauthorized access."
