"description": "The Random class in Java is not a cryptographically secure RNG. It is not appropriate for use in security-sensitive applications, such as generating cryptographic keys or nonces. The use of the Random class in this code snippet makes it vulnerable to attacks that exploit predictable or non-random behavior of the RNG.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the Random class with a cryptographically secure RNG, such as SecureRandom. This can be achieved by using the SecureRandom class in place of the Random class in the code snippet."
