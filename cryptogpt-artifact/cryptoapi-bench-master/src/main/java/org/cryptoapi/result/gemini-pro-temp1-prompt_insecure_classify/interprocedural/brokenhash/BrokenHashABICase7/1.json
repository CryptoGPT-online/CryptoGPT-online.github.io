    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code is using `MD4`, a known broken cryptographic algorithm, for hashing. `MD4` is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be exploited to create malicious certificates or digital signatures.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`."
