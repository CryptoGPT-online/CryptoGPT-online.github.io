    "vulnerable_code": "if (\"192.168.0.10\".equals(hostname)) {\n            return true;\n        }",
    "description": "This piece of code is manually validating the certificate hostname, which defeats the purpose of SSL/TLS. This is considered a misuse because it violates the principle of using trusted third parties for validation and authentication. This could potentially enable an attacker to bypass the security checks.",
    "recommendation": "Validating the hostname should be done through a trusted third party, such as the defaultHostnameVerifier of HttpsURLConnection. Avoid manually validating the hostname."
