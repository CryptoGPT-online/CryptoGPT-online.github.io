    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
    "description": "The key is derived from a password using `getBytes()` method. In this case, the key is only 16 bytes long, which is not considered secure for AES encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key generation mechanism, such as `SecretKeyFactory.generateSecret()` with an appropriate key size (e.g., 256 bits for AES)."
