        "description": "The keyLength argument in PBEKeySpec's constructor specifies the length of the key to be generated, which should be in bits rather than bytes. A common mistake is to provide the key length in bytes which could lead to a weaker key than intended if the underlying algorithm expects the length in bits.",

        "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value that is considered secure based on current standards, typically at least 10000 for minimal security, but higher numbers like 100000 or more could be more appropriate, depending on the sensitivity of the data."

        "recommendation": "Ensure that the salt is properly generated and stored, so that it can be used for password verification. Each user password should have its own unique salt."
