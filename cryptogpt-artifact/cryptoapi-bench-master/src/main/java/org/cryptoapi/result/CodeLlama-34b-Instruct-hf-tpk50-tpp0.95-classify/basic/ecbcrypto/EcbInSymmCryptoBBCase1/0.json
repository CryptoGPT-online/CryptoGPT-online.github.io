"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding",
"description": "The `AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding` cipher mode is vulnerable to attacks due to its use of a fixed initialization vector, which can be used to deduce the plaintext. Additionally, the use of ECB mode itself can reveal patterns in the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Replace `AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding` with a more secure cipher mode, such as `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding` or `AES/CTR/NoPadding`."
},

"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
"description": "The `AES` algorithm is vulnerable to attacks due to its relatively small key size. Additionally, the use of `KeyGenerator.getInstance()` to generate the key may result in the use of a weak key.",
"recommendation": "Replace `AES` with a more secure algorithm, such as `AES-256` or `Camellia-256`. Additionally, use a secure key generation method, such as `KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"Camellia-256\")`, to generate a strong key."
