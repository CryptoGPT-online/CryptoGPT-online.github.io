    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is initialized with a single byte seed, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. An attacker could potentially guess the seed and predict the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and seed it with a cryptographically secure random seed."
