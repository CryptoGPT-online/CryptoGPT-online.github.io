    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\");",
    "description": "The MD2 algorithm is a known weak hash algorithm and is no longer considered secure. It is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. This weakness makes it unsuitable for use in cryptographic applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD2."
