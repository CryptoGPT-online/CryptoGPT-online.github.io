Sure, here is the JSON report of the crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();\nSSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) ssf.createSocket(passedHostname,passedSoc);",
    "description": "The code is using the default SSLSocketFactory without any certificate validation. This means that the client will accept any certificate presented by the server, even if it is invalid or expired. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and intercept sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a custom SSLSocketFactory that performs certificate validation. This can be done by using the `SSLContext` class and specifying a `TrustManager` that validates the server's certificate."
  }
]
```

## Explanation:

* **CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation**

The code is using the default `SSLSocketFactory` without any certificate validation. This means that the client will accept any certificate presented by the server, even if it is invalid or expired. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and intercept sensitive data.

## Recommendation:

* Use a custom `SSLSocketFactory` that performs certificate validation. This can be done by using the `SSLContext` class and specifying a `TrustManager` that validates the server's certificate.
