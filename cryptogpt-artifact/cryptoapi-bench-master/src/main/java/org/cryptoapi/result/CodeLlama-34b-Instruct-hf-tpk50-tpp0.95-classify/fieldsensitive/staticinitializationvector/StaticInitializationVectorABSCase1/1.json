 {
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "passedIV = defIV;",
"description": "The method1 in class C1 takes a byte[] passedIV as an argument, but it is not used as the initialization vector (IV) for the Cipher object. Instead, the hardcoded defIV is used. This means that the same IV is always used for encryption, which is a security vulnerability.",
"recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded defIV and use the passedIV argument as the initialization vector instead."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
"description": "The bytes variable is initialized with a hardcoded string \"abcde\". This string is not randomly generated and is therefore not a secure initialization for the IV.",
"recommendation": "Replace the hardcoded string with a randomly generated byte array using a secure random number generator."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(passedIV);",
"description": "The IvParameterSpec class is not recommended for use because it does not provide any additional security benefits over using a hardcoded IV. Additionally, using a hardcoded IV can be a security vulnerability as it can be guessed by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation."
