"description": "The code uses the MD4 cryptographic hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for any security purposes. The algorithm has known collisions and can be easily attacked.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4. These algorithms are considered secure and have been extensively tested and reviewed by the cryptographic community."
