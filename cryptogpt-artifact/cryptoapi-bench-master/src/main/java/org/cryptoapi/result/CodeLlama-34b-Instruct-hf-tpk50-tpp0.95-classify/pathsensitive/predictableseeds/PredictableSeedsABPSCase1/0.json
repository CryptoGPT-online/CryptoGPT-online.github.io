"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate cryptographically secure random values, but the values used to seed it are not generated randomly. The seed is set using a fixed set of values, which can be guessed by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a truly random seed to generate the secure random values."
