"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random numbers, but the `SecureRandom()` constructor is not recommended as it uses a default seed which may not be secure. Instead, use the `SecureRandom` constructor that takes a `seed` argument to provide a secure seed.",
