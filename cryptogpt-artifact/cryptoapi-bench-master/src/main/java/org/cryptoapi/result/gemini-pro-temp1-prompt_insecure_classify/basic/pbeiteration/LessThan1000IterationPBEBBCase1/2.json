    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom.nextBytes()` to generate a salt value. However, the size of the salt array is fixed to 32 bytes, which may not be sufficient to provide adequate security.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, use a larger salt size or consider using a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom` with a strong seed value."
