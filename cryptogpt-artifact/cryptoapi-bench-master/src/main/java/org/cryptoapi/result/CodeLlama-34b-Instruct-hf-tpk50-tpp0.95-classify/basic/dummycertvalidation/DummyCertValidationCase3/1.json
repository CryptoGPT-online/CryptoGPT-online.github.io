        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "D3.java",
        "description": "The `D3` class implements `X509TrustManager` and overrides the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods, but these methods do not perform any validation of the provided certificates. This allows any certificate to be trusted, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods to ensure that only valid and trusted certificates are accepted."
