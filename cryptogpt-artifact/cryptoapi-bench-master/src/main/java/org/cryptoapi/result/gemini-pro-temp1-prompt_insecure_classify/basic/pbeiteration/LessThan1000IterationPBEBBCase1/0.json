    "description": "The code uses a 32-byte array to store the salt for PBKDF2, which is not sufficiently random. The salt should be at least 128 bits (16 bytes) to provide adequate security.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the size of the salt array to at least 16 bytes and use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the salt."
