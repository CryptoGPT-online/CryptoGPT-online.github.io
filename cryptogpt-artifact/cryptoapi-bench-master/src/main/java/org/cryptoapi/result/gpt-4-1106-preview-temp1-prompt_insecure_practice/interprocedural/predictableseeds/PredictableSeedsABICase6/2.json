    "description": "Using a single 'byte' value as the seed for SecureRandom does not provide a sufficient amount of entropy for secure randomness. Moreover, seeding SecureRandom in this manner results in predictable output which can lead to vulnerabilities (CWE-338).",
    "recommendation": "Do not manually seed SecureRandom unless you are certain there is enough entropy. Rely on the default seeding mechanism which typically uses platform-native entropy sources."
