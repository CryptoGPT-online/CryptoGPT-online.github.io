ECB mode is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols because it does not provide serious message confidentiality, as it encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks.",

Reusing an IV across multiple encryptions can compromise the security of the first block of encrypted data and, depending on the mode, potentially allow for some patterns to be discerned across ciphertexts.",
