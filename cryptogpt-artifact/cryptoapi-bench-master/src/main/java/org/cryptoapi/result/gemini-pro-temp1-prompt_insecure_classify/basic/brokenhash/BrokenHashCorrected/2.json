Sure. Here is the analysis of the provided Java code:

```json
[]
```

As you can see, the JSON array is empty. This means that I did not find any crypto API misuses in the code you provided.

The code you provided creates a MessageDigest object using the SHA-256 algorithm. This is a secure cryptographic algorithm and is not considered to be broken or risky. Additionally, the code does not hardcode any credentials or use any other insecure practices.

Therefore, I can confidently say that the code you provided does not contain any crypto API misuses.

I hope this analysis is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
