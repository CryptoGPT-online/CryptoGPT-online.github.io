    "description": "SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be used to create digital signatures that are difficult to verify.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
