"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
"description": "The use of the SecureRandom.ints() method to generate a cryptographic key is not recommended. The method returns a random integer, which may not be appropriate for use as a cryptographic key. The key should be randomly generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as the SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() method.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the cryptographic key, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."

{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16)",
"description": "The use of the Arrays.copyOf() method to pad the keyBytes array to a fixed length of 16 may result in the loss of entropy and reduce the strength of the cryptographic key. The key should be randomly generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as the SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() method.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the cryptographic key, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
