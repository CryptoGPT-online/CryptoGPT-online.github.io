        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
        "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate secure random numbers. However, the setSeed method can be used to specify a custom seed, which can be predictable and reduce the randomness of the generated numbers. This can make the code vulnerable to attacks that rely on predictable random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid using the setSeed method of the SecureRandom class and instead use the default constructor, which generates secure random numbers based on the system clock."
