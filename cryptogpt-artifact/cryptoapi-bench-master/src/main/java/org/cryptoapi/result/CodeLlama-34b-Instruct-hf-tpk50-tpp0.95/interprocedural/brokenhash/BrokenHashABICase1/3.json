"description": "The crypto algorithm used in this code is broken. SHA1 is a broken crypto algorithm and it should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use a more secure crypto algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead.",
"recommendation": "Replace the crypto algorithm with a more secure one. For example, you can replace 'SHA1' with 'SHA-256' or 'SHA-512'."
