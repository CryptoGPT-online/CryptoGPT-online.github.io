    "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Data Exposure in a URL",
    "vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(new URL(url));",
    "description": "The URL class in Java can be used to create a URL object from a string. However, it does not provide any protection against plaintext data exposure. This means that any sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, that are included in the URL can be easily intercepted and stolen.",
    "recommendation": "Use the URLDecoder class to decode the URL before using it. This will help to protect against plaintext data exposure."
