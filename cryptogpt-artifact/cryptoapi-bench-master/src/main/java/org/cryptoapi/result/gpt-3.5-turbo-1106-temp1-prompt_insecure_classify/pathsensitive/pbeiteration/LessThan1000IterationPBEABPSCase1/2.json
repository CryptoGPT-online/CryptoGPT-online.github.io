    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The code is using a low iteration count (5) for the Password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm, which can weaken the encryption strength and make it susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a secure value, generally recommended to be at least 10,000 or higher."
