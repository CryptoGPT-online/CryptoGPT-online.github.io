    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not properly seeded before generating random bytes for the salt. This can result in a weak or predictable salt, which can compromise the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable source of randomness to seed the SecureRandom instance. This can be done by using `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."

    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 20;",
    "description": "The iteration count for the PBKDF2 algorithm is set to 20, which is too low. This means that an attacker could potentially brute-force the password by trying a small number of possible combinations.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 100,000 to make it more difficult for an attacker to brute-force the password."
