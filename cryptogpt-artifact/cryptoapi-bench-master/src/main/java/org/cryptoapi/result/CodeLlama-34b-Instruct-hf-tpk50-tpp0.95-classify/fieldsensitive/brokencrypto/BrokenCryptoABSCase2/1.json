"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Blowfish",
"description": "Blowfish is a broken encryption algorithm that has been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks. It should not be used for any purpose.",
"recommendation": "Replace Blowfish with a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES."

"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "passedAlgo",
"description": "The encryption algorithm used is determined by the passedAlgo variable, which is not verified or validated. This could allow an attacker to specify a weak or broken encryption algorithm, which could be exploited.",
"recommendation": "Validate the passedAlgo variable to ensure it is a valid and secure encryption algorithm."
