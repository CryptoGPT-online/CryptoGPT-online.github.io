"description": "The passedSeed variable is used as the seed for the SecureRandom constructor. However, the seed is not properly randomized, as it is set to a fixed value (100) in the constructor of class C2. This can lead to predictable outputs from the SecureRandom class, which can be used to compromise the security of the application.",
