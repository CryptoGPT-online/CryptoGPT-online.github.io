        "vulnerable_code": "\"https://www.google.com\"",
        "description": "The URL to the keystore is hardcoded to a web address, which isn't necessarily a misuse on its own, but could imply that the keystore could be publicly accessible which is a security risk if it contains sensitive information.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the keystore is securely located and not publicly accessible, and consider using a configuration file or environment variables for specifying the keystore location."

        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
        "description": "Using 'random.ints()' does not guarantee a secure password because it generates a stream of random integers which is then converted to a string. This might not provide a sufficiently random or long enough value for secure password generation.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more robust method for generating passwords, such as a secure password generator API that guarantees sufficient complexity and length."

        "description": "The code is loading a KeyStore from a URL stream without any validation of the server's SSL certificate, which could expose the application to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper SSL certificate validation by configuring the SSL context and trust manager to ensure the authenticity of the connection."
