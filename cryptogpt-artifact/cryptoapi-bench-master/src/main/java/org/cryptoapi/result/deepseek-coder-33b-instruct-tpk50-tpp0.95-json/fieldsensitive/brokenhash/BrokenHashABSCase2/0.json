    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in the code is not secure as it uses MD5, which is a broken and considered vulnerable cryptographic algorithm. Broken or weak hash and cryptographic algorithms might leave room for attackers to exploit the system, especially for data integrity and authentication.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'MD5' with a secure and strong cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256, SHA-3, or Blake2."
