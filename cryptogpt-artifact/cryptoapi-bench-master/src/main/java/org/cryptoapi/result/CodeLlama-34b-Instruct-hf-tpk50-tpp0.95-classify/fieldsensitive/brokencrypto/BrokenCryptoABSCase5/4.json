{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\")",
"description": "The IDEA algorithm is a 64-bit block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks. It should not be used for secure communication.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, for encrypting sensitive data."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey()",
"description": "The generateKey() method of the KeyGenerator class generates a secret key based on the default algorithm, which in this case is IDEA. However, the default algorithm may not be secure, and it is important to use a secure algorithm for generating secret keys.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, for generating secret keys."
