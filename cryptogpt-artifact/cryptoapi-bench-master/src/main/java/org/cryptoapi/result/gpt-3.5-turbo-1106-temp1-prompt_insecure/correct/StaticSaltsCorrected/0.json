[{"misuse": "Use of Weak Random Number Generator (CWE-330)", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The SecureRandom instance is being used to generate salt for key derivation, but the use of the default constructor for SecureRandom may not guarantee a strong random number generation algorithm. Additionally, the size of the salt (32 bytes) might be excessive and not align with best practices.", "recommendation": "Initialize the SecureRandom instance with a specific cryptographic PRNG, such as SHA1PRNG, and ensure that a cryptographically secure random number generator (RNG) is used for generating the salt. Adjust the size of the salt to align with best practices, such as 16 bytes for salt length."}]
