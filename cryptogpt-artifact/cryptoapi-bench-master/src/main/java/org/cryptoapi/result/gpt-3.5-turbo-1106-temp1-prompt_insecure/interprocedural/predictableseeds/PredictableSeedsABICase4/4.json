    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The code uses SecureRandom with a byte array initialized with the value of a String representation of the seed. The String representation of the seed is directly converted to a byte using Byte.parseByte, and this can result in unexpected behavior or loss of data. ",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using the String representation of the seed directly, it is recommended to use a proper cryptographic algorithm like AES with a secure key generation and initialization process."
