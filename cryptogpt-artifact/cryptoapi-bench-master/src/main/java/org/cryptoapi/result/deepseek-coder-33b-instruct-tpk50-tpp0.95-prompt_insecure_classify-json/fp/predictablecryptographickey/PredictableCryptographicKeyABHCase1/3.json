public class P1 {
    public static void main(String [] args) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGenerator.init(128);
        SecretKey key = keyGenerator.generateKey();
        byte[] keyBytes = key.getEncoded();

        SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, "AES");
    }
}
```
In this example, we're generating a random 128-bit AES key using the `KeyGenerator` class, which is considered more secure than the previous method. The `SecretKey` object's encoded bytes are then used to create a `SecretKeySpec` object, which can be used for cryptographic operations.

Here, `UnsupportedEncodingException` and `NoSuchAlgorithmException` are added because these methods could throw such exceptions.

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values

Please note that these warnings are not always indicative of vulnerabilities. These may be legitimate uses if the algorithm is specifically chosen as part of a secure protocol or if the strength and suitability of the algorithm are guaranteed.
