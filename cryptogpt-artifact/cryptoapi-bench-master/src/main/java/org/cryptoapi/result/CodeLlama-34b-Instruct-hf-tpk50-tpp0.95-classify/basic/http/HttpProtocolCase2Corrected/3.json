        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "go(url)",
        "description": "The `go` method uses the `new URL(url)` constructor to create a URL object, which can potentially use an insecure algorithm for URL parsing. This can be a problem if the input URL contains malicious input that exploits a vulnerability in the algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure URL parser library, such as the Java URL class, to ensure that the URL is parsed correctly and safely."
