        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes)",
        "description": "When the random number generator is provided with a seed (via `setSeed()`), it may generate only predictable sequences because the values it produces are entirely based on the seed. In this case, the seed is not completely random but a specific byte array, which is a common mistake because it makes the generated sequence predictable. The random seed used should ideally be obtained from a secure random number generator to ensure it is genuinely random and cannot be predicted.",
        "recommendation": "In this case, you can generate the seed from a secure random source rather than manually setting it. A better approach would be to use 'SecureRandom' to generate the seed, so it's truly random. However, if you must use a specific seed, it should be generated from a source that is genuinely random, such as 'java.security.SecureRandom' or '/dev/urandom' in Unix systems."
