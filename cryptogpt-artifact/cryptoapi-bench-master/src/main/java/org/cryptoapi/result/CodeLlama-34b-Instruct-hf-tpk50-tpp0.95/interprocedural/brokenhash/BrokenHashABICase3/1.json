"description": "The MD4 algorithm is known to be insecure and should not be used for any purpose, especially for hashing sensitive data. Using MD4 in this example code can lead to a vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Replace the usage of MD4 with a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-384. It is also recommended to use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or argon2, for password storage."
