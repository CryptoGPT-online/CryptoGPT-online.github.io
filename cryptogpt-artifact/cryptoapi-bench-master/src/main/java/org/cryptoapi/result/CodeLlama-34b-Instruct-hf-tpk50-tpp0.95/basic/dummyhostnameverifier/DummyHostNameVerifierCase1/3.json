 {"misuse": "Weak Hostname Verification", "vulnerable_code": "return true;", "description": "The verify method always returns true, allowing any hostname to be verified without checking the SSL session. This can lead to a MITM attack where an attacker can intercept the communication between the client and server.", "recommendation": "Use a secure hostname verification mechanism, such as a whitelist of allowed hostnames, to prevent MITM attacks."}
