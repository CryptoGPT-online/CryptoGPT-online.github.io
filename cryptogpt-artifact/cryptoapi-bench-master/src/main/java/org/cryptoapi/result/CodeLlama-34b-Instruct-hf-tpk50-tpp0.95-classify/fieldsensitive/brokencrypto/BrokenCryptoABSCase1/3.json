{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C2 class constructor: new C2(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "The code uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for encryption. DES is a 64-bit encryption algorithm that can be cracked in a few hours on a reasonably powered computer. It should be replaced with a more secure algorithm, such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the usage of DES encryption algorithm with AES encryption algorithm in the C2 class constructor."

{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "C2 class constructor: KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo)",
"description": "The code uses the KeyGenerator class to generate a key without properly validating the certificate. This can lead to the usage of an insecure or broken key, which can compromise the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Add proper certificate validation to the KeyGenerator class in the C2 class constructor."

{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "C2 class constructor: Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo)",
"description": "The code uses the Cipher class to initialize a cipher without properly validating the certificate. This can lead to the usage of an insecure or broken key, which can compromise the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Add proper certificate validation to the Cipher class in the C2 class constructor."
