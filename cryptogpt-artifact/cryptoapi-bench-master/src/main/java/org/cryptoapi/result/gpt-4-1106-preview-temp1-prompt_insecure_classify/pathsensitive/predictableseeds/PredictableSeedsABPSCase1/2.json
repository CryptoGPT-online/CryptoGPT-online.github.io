        "description": "The code is seeding the SecureRandom instance with a fixed, predictable byte array, which can lead to insufficiently random values that are not cryptographically secure.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting the seed with predictable values. If you must set a seed, ensure it comes from a highly random source. In most cases, you should let the SecureRandom instance seed itself automatically."
