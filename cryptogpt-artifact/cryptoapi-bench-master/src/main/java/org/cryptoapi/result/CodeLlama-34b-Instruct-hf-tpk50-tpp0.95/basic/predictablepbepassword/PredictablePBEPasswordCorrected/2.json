"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom().ints()",
"description": "The SecureRandom.ints() method generates a sequence of random integers, but it does not guarantee that the sequence is cryptographically secure. This can lead to predictable output, which can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the encryption algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) instead, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
