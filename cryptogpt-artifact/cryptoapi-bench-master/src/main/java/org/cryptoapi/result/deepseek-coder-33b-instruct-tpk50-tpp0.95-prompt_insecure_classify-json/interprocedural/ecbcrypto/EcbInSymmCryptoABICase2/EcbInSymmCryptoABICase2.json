In the provided code, there is a false positive misuse found:

1. The misuse "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" is a false positive because the ECB mode is not inherently insecure. It depends on the context and specific requirements of the application. If the ECB mode is necessary for some specific use case, then it should be used carefully and checked if it meets the required security requirements.

2. The misuse "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" is also a false positive. In this case, the keys are generated using the KeyGenerator, which uses a secure random number generator for key generation. Therefore, the use of the KeyGenerator is secure, assuming that the KeyGenerator's implementation is also secure.

3. The misuse "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" is a false positive. The use of AES 128 bit encryption is considered secure enough for many applications. If a stronger key length is required, this should be the decision made based on the specific requirements of the application and not a false positive.

The JSON lists of cryptographic API misuses can be optimized as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
        "description": "ECB mode without IV and PKCS5 padding may leave the same patterns in the plaintext",
        "recommendation": "Always use hardcoded, secure cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation"
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
        "description": "Hardcoding crypto in the getInstance method is not secure",
        "recommendation": "Do not hardcode credentials, instead use secure methods for storing and retrieving sensitive data"
    }
]
```
