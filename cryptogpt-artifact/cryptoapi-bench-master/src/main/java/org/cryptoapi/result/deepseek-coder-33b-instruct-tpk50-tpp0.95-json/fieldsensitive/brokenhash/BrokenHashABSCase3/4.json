    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MessageDigest class to generate a hash, and the algorithm used is determined by a variable named crypto. The algorithm for generating the hash is determined in the constructor of the C3 class. The crypto variable is initially set to 'MD4', but then it is used directly in the MessageDigest.getInstance() method without validation. 'MD4' is a weak hash algorithm and should not be used for security-critical purposes.",
    "recommendation": "You should not use the MD4 hash algorithm for security-critical operations. Instead, use a stronger algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3. Also, you should add a whitelist of acceptable algorithms and check the passed algorithm against the whitelist before using it to create a MessageDigest instance."
