        "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
        "description": "The count parameter in the PBEParameterSpec constructor is an integer that represents the number of iterations of the hashing function. A low number of iterations can make the hash vulnerable to brute force attacks. The recommended minimum number of iterations is 10,000.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to at least 10,000."
