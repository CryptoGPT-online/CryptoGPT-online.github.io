  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
  "description": "The use of a single-byte seed for SecureRandom does not provide a sufficiently random seed value. This can lead to predictability in generated values which may be exploited.",
  "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without a seed to allow the underlying platform to generate a sufficiently random seed, or use a more complex and unpredictable seed value sourced from a proper entropy source."
