    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is seeded with a user-supplied seed that is not properly generated. This can lead to a predictable sequence of random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is seeded with a high-quality source of entropy, such as /dev/urandom on Linux or CryptGenRandom on Windows."
