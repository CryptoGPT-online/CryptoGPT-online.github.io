    "description": "The iteration count for the PBEParameterSpec is not generated randomly. The count is generated based on the value of the 'count' variable, which is set to the 'count' value from the go3() method, which was set in the go2() method. The count value is set as the result of transforming the DEFAULT_COUNT value to a char array in the go2() method, which is '20'. This leads to insecure encryption.",
