  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
  "description": "The security of SecureRandom depends on the unpredictability of the seed. Providing a single, static byte as a seed may result in predictable output, which is inappropriate for secure applications.",
  "recommendation": "Use the no-argument constructor of SecureRandom to allow the implementation to produce a secure, unpredictable seed, or provide a properly generated seed with adequate entropy."
