        "description": "The iteration count of the PBE algorithm is not securely generated or defined. A low iteration count may make the PBE algorithm slow, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks. Furthermore, it may leak information about the password being used.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding an iteration count, it should be set based on a trusted resource. A higher iteration count can reduce the impact of brute force attacks. It's recommended that the iteration count be at least 10000 and should be increased as computational power increases."
