        "description": "The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, such as the `SecureRandom` class in Java, can lead to insecure random number generation. In this case, the `SecureRandom` class is being used with a fixed seed, which can lead to predictable random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure and properly seeded random number generator, such as the `Random` class with a secure seed."
