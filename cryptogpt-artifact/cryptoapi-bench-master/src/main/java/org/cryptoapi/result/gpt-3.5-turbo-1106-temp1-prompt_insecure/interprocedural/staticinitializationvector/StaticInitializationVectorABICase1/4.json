  "description": "The KeyGenerator.generateKey() method is a known insecure method for generating the AES key. It uses a platform-dependent source of randomness, and the generated key might not be suitable for cryptographic operations.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure method to generate the AES key, such as SecureRandom to generate a secure random key, or use a key derivation function like PBKDF2 to derive a key from a password or passphrase."}]
