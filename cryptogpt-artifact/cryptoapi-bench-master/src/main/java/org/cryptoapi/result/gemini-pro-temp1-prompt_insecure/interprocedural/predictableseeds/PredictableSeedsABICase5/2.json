    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Seeding of Random Number Generator",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The seed value for the `SecureRandom` instance is generated from a small number of bytes, which may not be sufficient to ensure randomness. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger seed value, such as one generated from a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). Java provides the `SecureRandom` class for this purpose."
