"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();\nint x = randomGenerator.nextInt();",
"description": "The Random class in Java is a pseudorandom number generator, which means that it does not produce true random numbers, but rather a deterministic sequence of numbers that appears to be random. This can be a problem if the numbers are used for security-related purposes, as an attacker may be able to predict the sequence of numbers and exploit it. In this example, the Random class is being used to generate a random number, but it is not being seeded with a secure random value, which means that it is not truly random.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as the SecureRandom class, to generate random numbers for security-related purposes. Also, make sure to seed the secure random number generator with a high-entropy seed."
