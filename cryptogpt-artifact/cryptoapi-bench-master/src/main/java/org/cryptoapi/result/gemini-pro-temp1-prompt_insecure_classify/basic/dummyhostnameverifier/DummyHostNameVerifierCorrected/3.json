    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
    "description": "Using the default hostname verifier (`HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier()`) is insecure because it does not perform proper certificate validation. This means that an attacker could present a certificate for a different hostname and the connection would still be established, allowing them to impersonate the intended server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a hostname verifier that performs proper certificate validation, such as one that checks the hostname against the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field in the certificate."
