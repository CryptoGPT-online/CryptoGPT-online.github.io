    "description": "The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1977. DES has been succeeded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is more secure and efficient. DES should not be used for new applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic algorithm, such as AES."
