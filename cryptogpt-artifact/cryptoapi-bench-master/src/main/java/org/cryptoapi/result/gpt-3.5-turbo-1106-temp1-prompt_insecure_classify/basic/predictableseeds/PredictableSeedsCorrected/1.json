[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "long l = sr.nextLong();\nsr.setSeed(l);\nint v = sr.nextInt();", "description": "In the given code, the SecureRandom object is seeded with a single long value generated by the nextLong() method. This single value does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "To ensure sufficient randomness, it is recommended to use a stronger seed generation mechanism, such as using multiple random values or a combination of system time and other sources of randomness."}]
