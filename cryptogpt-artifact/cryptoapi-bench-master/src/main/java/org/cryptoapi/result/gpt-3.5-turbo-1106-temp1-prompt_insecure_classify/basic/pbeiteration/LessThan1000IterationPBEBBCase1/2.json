    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a salt, but the length of the salt is hard-coded to 32 bytes, which may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator with an adequate salt length for the specific cryptographic operation. The salt length should be in line with best practices for the specific algorithm being used."
