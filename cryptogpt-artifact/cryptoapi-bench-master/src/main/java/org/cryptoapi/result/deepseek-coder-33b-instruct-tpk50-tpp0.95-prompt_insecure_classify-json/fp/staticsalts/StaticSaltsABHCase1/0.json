byte[] salt = {b,b};
```

Description: The salt is generated from a single byte, which is deterministic and can be easily guessed.

Recommendation: To fix this, the salt should ideally be a random or pseudo-random value derived from a secure seed. The size of the salt could be set to a high enough value to make the salt virtually unique.

Please note, this recommendation would need careful consideration based on the specific use case and requirements for the PBEParameterSpec salt.
