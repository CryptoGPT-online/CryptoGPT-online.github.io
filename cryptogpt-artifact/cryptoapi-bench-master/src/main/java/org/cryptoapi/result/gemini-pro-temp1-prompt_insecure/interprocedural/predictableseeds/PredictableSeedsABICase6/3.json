    "misuse": "Insufficient Entropy for Random Number Generator (CWE-321)",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "Using a single byte as the seed for the `SecureRandom` instance does not provide sufficient entropy, making the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that accepts a larger seed size, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and seed it with a high-quality source of entropy, such as `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows."
