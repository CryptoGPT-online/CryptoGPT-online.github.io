[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The code is generating a salt using the SecureRandom class, but it is using a fixed length of 32 bytes for the salt. This can result in a weak salt value which can make the cryptographic operation vulnerable to attacks.", "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator and generate a random salt with sufficient length, typically 128 bits or more."}]
