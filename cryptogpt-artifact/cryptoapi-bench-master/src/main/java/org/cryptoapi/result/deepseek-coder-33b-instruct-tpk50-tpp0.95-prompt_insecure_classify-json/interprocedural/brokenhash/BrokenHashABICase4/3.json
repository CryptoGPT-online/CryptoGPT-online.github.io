  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
  "description": "In this code, the crypto algorithm is chosen by user input. If the user input is not verified, a chosen cipher or hash can be a risky one. An attacker can use an identified weakness in the algorithm, making it easier to compromise security. MD2 is considered broken because there are significant and well-known collision attacks against it.",
  "recommendation": "Do not allow user input to choose the crypto algorithm. Instead, choose a secure algorithm and use it consistently. MD5 and SHA-256 are recommended for most common uses."
