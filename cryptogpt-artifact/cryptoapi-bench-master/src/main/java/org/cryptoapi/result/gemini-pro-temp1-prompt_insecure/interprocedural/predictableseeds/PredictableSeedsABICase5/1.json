    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Entropy",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
    "description": "The seed used for the SecureRandom object is not sufficiently random, as it is generated from a small set of fixed values. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the SecureRandom object, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating the seed for the SecureRandom object, such as using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) or obtaining the seed from a trusted source."
