    "misuse": "Weak Seeding of Random Number Generator (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "Using a single byte as the seed for the `SecureRandom` instance makes the generated random numbers predictable and susceptible to brute-force attacks. This can compromise the security of applications that rely on randomness, such as cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a cryptographically secure seed using a more robust method, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which uses a high-quality entropy source."
