    "description": "The code uses RSA in ECB mode, which is a legacy encryption mode that is vulnerable to various attacks. Attackers can exploit the ECB mode to recover plaintext information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption mode such as CBC, CFB, or OFB, which are less vulnerable to attacks."
