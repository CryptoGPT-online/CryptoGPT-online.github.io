    "description": "The use of ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode is insecure. ECB mode does not provide any confidentiality for repeated plaintext blocks, making it vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace ECB mode with a more secure mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)."
