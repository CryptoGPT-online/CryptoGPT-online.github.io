"description": "The provided crypto algorithm, MD2, is a broken and insecure algorithm that should not be used for any purpose. It is a weak and easily exploitable hash function that has been proven to be vulnerable to collisions and other attacks.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of MD2 with a more secure and robust cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. Additionally, consider using a secure and randomized salt to further protect the cryptographic hash function from attacks."
