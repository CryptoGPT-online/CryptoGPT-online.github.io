    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The key generation process in this code is using a fixed string \"defaultkey\" to derive the encryption key. This reduces the encryption strength and makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong and random key using a secure random generator, and ensure that the key length is suitable for the encryption algorithm being used."
