        "description": "The application uses the weak hashing algorithm, MD5, in this case. The MD5 algorithm is no longer considered to be secure. The developer may be using it to store passwords or for any other kind of data that needs to be hashed but should be resistant to hash flooding attacks or at least more secure than MD5.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger cryptographic hash algorithm such as SHA-256. SHA-256 is secure, more resistant to attacks, and widely accepted. You can replace MD5 with SHA-256 in your code by changing 'MD5' to 'SHA-256'."
