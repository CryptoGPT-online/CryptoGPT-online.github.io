        "description": "Using a broken crypto algorithm, SecureRandom in this case, can lead to predictable and insecure random numbers being generated. In this specific case, using a single byte as a seed for the SecureRandom algorithm can result in a small key space, which can be brute forced easily.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the SecureRandom class with a more secure cryptographic RNG, such as SHA-512 or AES-CTR, or use a larger seed size to increase the key space."

        "recommendation": "Avoid using malleable cryptographic operations and instead use a more secure approach, such as printing the random number in a binary format or using a cryptographic hash function to protect the data."
