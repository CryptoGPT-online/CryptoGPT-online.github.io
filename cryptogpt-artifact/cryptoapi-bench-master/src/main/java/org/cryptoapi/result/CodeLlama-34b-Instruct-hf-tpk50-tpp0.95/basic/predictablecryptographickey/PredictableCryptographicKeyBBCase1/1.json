"description": "The AES encryption algorithm requires a 16-byte key, but the default key provided is only 9 bytes long. This will result in the AES encryption algorithm using a weak and broken key, which can be easily broken by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a longer and more secure key for the AES encryption algorithm. It is recommended to use a randomly generated key of at least 16 bytes."
