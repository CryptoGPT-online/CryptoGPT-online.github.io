    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode for encryption, which is a vulnerable mode of operation. ECB mode does not provide any protection against repeated plaintext attacks, meaning that an attacker can easily identify and exploit patterns in the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Change the cipher mode to a more secure mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), which provide better protection against attacks."
