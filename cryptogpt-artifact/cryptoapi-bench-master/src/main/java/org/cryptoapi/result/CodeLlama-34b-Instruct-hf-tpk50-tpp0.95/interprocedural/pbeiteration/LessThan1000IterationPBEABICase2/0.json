"recommendation": "The count parameter should be validated to ensure that it is within the correct range, and that it is not a weak or compromised value. Additionally, the code should use a secure random number generator to generate the salt value."

"description": "The code generates a salt value using a random number generator, but the generated salt has a fixed length of 32 bytes. This can lead to a vulnerability in the encryption algorithm, as a fixed-length salt can be easily guessed or brute-forced.",
"recommendation": "The code should use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the salt value, and the salt should have a sufficient entropy to prevent guessing or brute-forcing."
