    "description": "`IDEA` is a legacy symmetric encryption algorithm that is considered insecure and should not be used. It is vulnerable to various attacks, including brute-force and differential cryptanalysis.",
    "recommendation": "Replace `IDEA` with a more secure symmetric encryption algorithm such as `AES` or `ChaCha20`."

    "description": "The key generator is not properly seeded with a secure random number generator. This means that the generated key may be predictable, allowing an attacker to potentially decrypt encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to seed the key generator, such as `SecureRandom`. Additionally, consider using a key derivation function (KDF) to strengthen the key before using it for encryption."
