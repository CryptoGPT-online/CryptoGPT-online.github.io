    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses the ECB block cipher mode, which is insecure. ECB mode does not provide confidentiality because identical plaintext blocks always encrypt to identical ciphertext blocks. This can allow an attacker to identify patterns in the plaintext, even if they do not know the key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC or CTR, instead of ECB."
