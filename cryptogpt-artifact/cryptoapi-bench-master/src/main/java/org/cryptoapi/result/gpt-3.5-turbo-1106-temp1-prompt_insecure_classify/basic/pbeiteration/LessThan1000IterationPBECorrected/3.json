[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The 'random.nextBytes(salt)' method is used to generate a salt for password-based encryption (PBE). However, the 'SecureRandom' class may not provide sufficient randomness, leading to weak cryptographic security.", "recommendation": "Use a cryptographic random number generator, such as 'SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()', instead of 'SecureRandom'. This ensures sufficient randomness for generating salts and other cryptographic values."}]
