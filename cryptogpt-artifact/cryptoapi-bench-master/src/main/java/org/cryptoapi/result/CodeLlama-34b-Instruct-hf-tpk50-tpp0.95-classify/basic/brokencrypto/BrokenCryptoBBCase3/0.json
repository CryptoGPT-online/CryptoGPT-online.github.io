"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC4\");",
"description": "The use of the RC4 algorithm is a known vulnerability, as it has been shown to be susceptible to attacks such as the Flame malware. This algorithm should be replaced with a more secure algorithm such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of RC4 with a more secure algorithm such as AES."
