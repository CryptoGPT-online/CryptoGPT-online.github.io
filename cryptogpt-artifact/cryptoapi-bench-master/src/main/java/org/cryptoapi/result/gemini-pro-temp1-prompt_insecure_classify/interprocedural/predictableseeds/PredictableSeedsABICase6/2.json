    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with a seed value that is generated from a single byte. This is not sufficient to generate a cryptographically strong random number.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, or generate a seed value from a secure source, such as `/dev/urandom` or `CryptGenRandom`."
