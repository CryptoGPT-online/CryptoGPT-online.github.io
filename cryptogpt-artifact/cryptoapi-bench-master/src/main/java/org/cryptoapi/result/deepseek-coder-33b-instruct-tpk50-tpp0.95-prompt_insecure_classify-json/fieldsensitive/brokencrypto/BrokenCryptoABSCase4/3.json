        "description": "The code is using RC2 as cryptographic algorithm, which is considered to be a risky and broken cryptographic algorithm. RC2 is vulnerable to a number of attacks, including attacks that can crack the key in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as AES, ChaCha20 or RSA.",

        "description": "The generated key for RC2 is not sufficiently random, which can make the encryption algorithm weaker. A good cryptographic algorithm should use random keys to ensure security. The code should use a more secure way to generate random keys.",
