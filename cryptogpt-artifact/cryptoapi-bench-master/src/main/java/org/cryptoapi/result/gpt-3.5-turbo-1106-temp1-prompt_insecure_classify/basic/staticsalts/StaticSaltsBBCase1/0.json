    "description": "The salt used for encryption is only one byte long, which is inadequate for providing sufficient entropy. The count value of 1020 is also low, which suggests that the number of iterations for key generation is insufficient.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a longer and more random salt value. Increase the count value to ensure a higher number of iterations for key generation."
