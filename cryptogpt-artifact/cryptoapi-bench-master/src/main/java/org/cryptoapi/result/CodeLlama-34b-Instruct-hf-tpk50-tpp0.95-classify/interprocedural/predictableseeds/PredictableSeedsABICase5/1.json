    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom.setSeed(seed)",
        "description": "The method `method2` initializes a new `SecureRandom` instance with a hardcoded seed value `seed`. This seed value is not truly random and may be easily predicted by an attacker, allowing them to predict the output of `sr.nextInt()`.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance. One option is to use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to obtain a CSPRNG instance, and then call `setSeed` on that instance. Another option is to use a random number generator that is designed to be resistant to tampering, such as the `java.security.SecureRandom` class."
