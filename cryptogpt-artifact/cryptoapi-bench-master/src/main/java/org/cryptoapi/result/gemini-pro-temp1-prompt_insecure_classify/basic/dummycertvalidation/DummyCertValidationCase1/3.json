    "vulnerable_code": [
      "//Trust any client connecting (no certificate validation)",
      "//Trust any remote server (no certificate validation)"
    ],
    "description": "The code disables certificate validation for both client and server certificates. This means that any client or server can connect to the application without providing a valid certificate. This can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate clients or servers and compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Always validate certificates to ensure that clients and servers are who they claim to be. This can be done by using a trust manager that checks the validity of certificates against a list of trusted certificates."
