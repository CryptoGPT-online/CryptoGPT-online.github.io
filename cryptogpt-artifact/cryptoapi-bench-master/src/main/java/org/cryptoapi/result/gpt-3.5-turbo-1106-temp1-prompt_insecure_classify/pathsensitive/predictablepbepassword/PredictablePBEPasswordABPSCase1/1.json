    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The code uses the PBEKeySpec class from Java's crypto API to derive a key from a password. However, it does not specify a secure hashing algorithm or key derivation function (KDF). Instead, it uses the default algorithm which may not provide sufficient security. The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is a CWE-327 vulnerability.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, specify a secure hashing algorithm or KDF such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt instead of using the default algorithm."
