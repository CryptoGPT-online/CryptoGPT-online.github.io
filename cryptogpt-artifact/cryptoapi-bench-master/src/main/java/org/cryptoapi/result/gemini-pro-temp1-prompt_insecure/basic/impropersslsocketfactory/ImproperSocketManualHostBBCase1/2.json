    "description": "Using the default SSLSocketFactory may result in weak encryption algorithms being used, which could allow an attacker to intercept and decrypt sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure SSLSocketFactory implementation that supports stronger encryption algorithms, such as TLSv1.2 with AES-256 encryption."
