 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RC2\")", "description": "The use of the RC2 algorithm is insecure and should be avoided. It is a 64-bit block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES with a larger block size and key size."}

{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")", "description": "The AES algorithm is a 128-bit block cipher, but the key size is only 128 bits, which is considered too small for secure encryption. Additionally, the use of CBC mode without proper padding can lead to padding oracle attacks.", "recommendation": "Use AES with a larger key size (such as 256-bit) and use an authenticated mode of operation such as GCM or EAX."}

{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "if (choice > 1) cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")", "description": "The code selects a less secure algorithm (RC2) if the choice variable is less than or equal to 1. This can allow an attacker to downgrade the encryption to a less secure algorithm, which can be easier to break.", "recommendation": "Ensure that the code always selects a secure algorithm, and that the user is not able to select a less secure algorithm."}
