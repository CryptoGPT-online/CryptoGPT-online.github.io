  "description": "The SecureRandom instance is seeded with a statically defined byte array, which does not provide strong entropy and may weaken the randomness of the generator.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure and unpredictable source of randomness for seeding the SecureRandom instance, such as the SecureRandom itself or other truly random sources like /dev/urandom."}]
