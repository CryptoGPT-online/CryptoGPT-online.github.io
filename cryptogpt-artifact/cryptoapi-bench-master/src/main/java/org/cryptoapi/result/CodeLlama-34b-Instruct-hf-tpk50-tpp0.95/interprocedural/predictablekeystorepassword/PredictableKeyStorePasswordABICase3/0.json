"description": "The method uses the JKS (Java Keystore) format for storing and managing the cryptographic keys. However, the JKS format is considered insecure and should not be used for storing sensitive data.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic storage format such as PKCS#12 or a hardware security module (HSM) to store the cryptographic keys."

"misuse": "Mishandling of Sensitive Data",
"vulnerable_code": "P3.method2",
"description": "The method loads the cryptographic keys from a remote URL. However, the method does not validate the authenticity and integrity of the data being loaded, which could lead to the loading of malicious data, such as a malicious keystore file.",
"recommendation": "Add validation and authentication mechanisms to ensure that the data being loaded is authentic and has not been tampered with."

{
"misuse": "Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "P3.main",
"description": "The method hardcodes the keystore password in the code, which could be easily extracted and used to compromise the security of the cryptographic keys.",
"recommendation": "Do not hardcode sensitive information such as passwords in the code. Instead, use secure storage mechanisms such as environment variables or configuration files to store and manage sensitive data."
