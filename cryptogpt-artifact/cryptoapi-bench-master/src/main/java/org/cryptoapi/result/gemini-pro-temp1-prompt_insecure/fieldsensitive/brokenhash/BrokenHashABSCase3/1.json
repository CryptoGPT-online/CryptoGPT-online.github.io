    "description": "The MD4 algorithm is considered weak and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD4 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
