    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The MessageDigest class uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure. MD4 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as message forgery and identity theft.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."

    "description": "The code allows the caller to specify the algorithm to use for encryption, but if the caller does not specify an algorithm, the code falls back to using MD4, which is a weak algorithm. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as message forgery and identity theft.",
    "recommendation": "Do not allow the caller to specify the algorithm to use for encryption. Instead, always use a strong algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
