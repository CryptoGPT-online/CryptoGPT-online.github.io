    "description": "The code directly uses `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()`, which is a hardcoded credential. This is not secure because it means that anyone with access to the code can see the hostname and port that the socket is being created for.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()`, the code should use a more secure method for creating a socket, such as using a `SSLContext` object."
