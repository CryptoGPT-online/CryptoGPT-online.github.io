{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"IDEA\")\nCipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\")",
  "description": "The code is using the \"IDEA\" algorithm for both generating the key and initializing the cipher. IDEA is considered a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm because it is no longer considered secure and has been replaced by more secure algorithms like AES.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm like AES instead of IDEA."
