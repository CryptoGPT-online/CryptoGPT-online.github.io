"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes)",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is designed to provide a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generator. However, the setSeed method used in this code is not suitable for cryptographic use cases. It uses the given byte array to set the seed, which is predictable and can be easily guessed. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as predictable random number generation, which can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, such as the SecureRandom class in Java, and avoid using the setSeed method. Instead, use the generateSeed method to generate a random seed."
