        "description": "The key generated by the key generator is too short, which weakens the overall security of the encryption. The recommended minimum key size for the RC2 algorithm is 128 bits, but it is recommended to use at least 256 bits for all keys.",
        "recommendation": "Increase the key size by specifying the 'keysize' parameter in the 'KeyGenerator.getInstance()' method. For example, 'KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto, 256)'. This will generate a key with a size of 256 bits."
