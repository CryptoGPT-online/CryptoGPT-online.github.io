 {
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed})",
"description": "The seed value used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is not truly random and may be predictable, which can weaken the security of the random number generation.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure and unpredictable method to generate the seed value, such as using the Random class to generate a random byte array, or using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the seed value."
