    "description": "The code uses the RC4 encryption algorithm, which is considered vulnerable and unfit for many purposes. It was designed in 1994 and it was found vulnerable due to extensive cryptanalytic research. Modern cryptography suggests that the RC4 algorithm is no longer secure and should not be used in new systems, with the exception of legacy systems which require it.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the RC4 algorithm with a more secure one. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely recommended choice due to its balance of strength and efficiency. Alternatively, consider using a block cipher mode of operation (like Cipher Block Chaining Mode, which is commonly used with AES)."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC4\");\n Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\");",
    "description": "RC4 does not have a key size parameter. This means that keys generated by this algorithm can be of arbitrary size, ranging from 1 byte to the entire byte array available. The key size can be set beforehand, but it's common to use a fixed size for simplicity, such as 128-bits (16 bytes). If no key size is set explicitly, it may default to using a small key size, making encryption weaker than necessary.",
    "recommendation": "When using RC4, it is highly recommended to set a secure key size. AES, for instance, requires a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The exact key size to use depends on the specific requirements of the application."
