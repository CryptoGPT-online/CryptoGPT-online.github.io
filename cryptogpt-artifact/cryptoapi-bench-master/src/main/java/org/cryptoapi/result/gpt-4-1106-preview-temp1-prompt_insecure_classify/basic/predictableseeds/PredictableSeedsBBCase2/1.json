        "description": "The code is initializing a SecureRandom instance with a single-byte seed, which does not provide enough entropy for secure random number generation.",
        "recommendation": "Do not manually seed SecureRandom unless absolutely necessary; allow the system to self-seed from entropy sources. If seeding is required for unit tests, consider using a mocking framework instead of compromising security."
