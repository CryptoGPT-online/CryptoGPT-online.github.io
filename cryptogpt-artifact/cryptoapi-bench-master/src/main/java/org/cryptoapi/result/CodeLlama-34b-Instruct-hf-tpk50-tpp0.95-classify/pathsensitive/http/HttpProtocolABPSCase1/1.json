 {"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "if(choice>1)\n            url = \"https://www.google.com\";", "description": "The URL being printed is based on the value of the 'choice' variable, which is user-provided. If the user provides a value greater than 1, the URL will be printed as \"https://www.google.com\", which may not be the intended or secure URL.", "recommendation": "To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the URL being printed is a trusted and secure URL, rather than relying on user-provided input."}
