"description": "The encryption key is generated using a password-based key derivation function (PBKDF), which is a vulnerable way to generate encryption keys. Additionally, the iteration count of 10000 is too low, making it vulnerable to attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger key derivation function, such as Argon2 or PBKDF2, with a higher iteration count to generate the encryption key securely. Additionally, the salt used should be randomly generated and stored securely."},

"vulnerable_code": "private static char[] ENCRYPT_KEY = KEY.toCharArray();",
"description": "The encryption key is statically defined in the code, which makes it vulnerable to attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks. Additionally, the key is not properly generated, as it is based on a hardcoded string 'sagar' which is not randomly generated.",
"recommendation": "Use a randomly generated encryption key, stored securely, and with a higher iteration count to generate the encryption key securely. Additionally, use a stronger key derivation function, such as Argon2 or PBKDF2, to generate the encryption key."},

"description": "The encryption key size is too small, making it vulnerable to attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks. Additionally, the key is not properly generated, as it is based on a hardcoded string 'sagar' which is not randomly generated.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key size, such as 256 or 512 bits, and use a randomly generated encryption key, stored securely, and with a higher iteration count to generate the encryption key securely. Additionally, use a stronger key derivation function, such as Argon2 or PBKDF2, to generate the encryption key."}
