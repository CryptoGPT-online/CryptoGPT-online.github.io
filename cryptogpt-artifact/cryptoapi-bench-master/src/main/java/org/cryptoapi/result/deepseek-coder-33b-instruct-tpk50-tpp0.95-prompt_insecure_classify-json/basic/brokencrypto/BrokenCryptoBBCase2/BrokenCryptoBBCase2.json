Based on the code provided and the misuses listed, it is confirmed that there is a cryptographic API misuse that can be classified as "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm".

The vulnerable_code in the first JSON misuse is "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish\");", which suggests that the Blowfish algorithm is being used. The description suggests that Blowfish is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. 

However, when comparing this misuse to the optimized code, it can be observed that a more secure algorithm (AES) is being used. Therefore, the first misuse in the JSON can be considered a false positive.

Based on the rest of the code and the misuses, there is no cryptographic misuse left in the code, which means the second misuse in the JSON can also be considered a false positive.

Thus, the list of optimized cryptographic API misuses would be:
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "None",
        "vulnerable_code": "",
        "description": "The provided code does not contain any specific cryptographic misuses.",
        "recommendation": "No specific recommendations needed."
    }
]
```
