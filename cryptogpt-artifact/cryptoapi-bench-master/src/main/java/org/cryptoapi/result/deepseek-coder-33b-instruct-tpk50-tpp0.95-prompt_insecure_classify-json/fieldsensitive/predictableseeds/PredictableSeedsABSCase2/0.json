        "description": "The SecureRandom instance is using a non-random number as a seed. Using a static or predictable seed can lead to vulnerabilities in the encryption algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Generate random keys for your encryption algorithm. If the SecureRandom class is being used to generate nonce or initialization vectors, use a unique seed for each operation. If a static seed is necessary, ensure the seed is difficult to predict and is changed regularly."
