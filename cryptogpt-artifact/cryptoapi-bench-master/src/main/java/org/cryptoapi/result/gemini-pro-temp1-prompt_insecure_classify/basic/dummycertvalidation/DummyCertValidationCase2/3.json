    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public class D2 implements X509TrustManager {...}",
    "description": "The code implements a custom X509TrustManager, which is used to validate SSL certificates. However, the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods are empty, which means that any certificate will be accepted without any validation. This is insecure and could allow an attacker to impersonate a trusted party.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods. This can be done by verifying that the certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) and that the hostname matches the certificate's Common Name (CN)."
