{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1",
"description": "The P1 class uses the `PBEKeySpec` class, which is a known broken crypto algorithm. The `PBEKeySpec` class is based on the PBE algorithm, which uses a password as a key, and is vulnerable to brute force attacks. The `PBEKeySpec` class also uses a static salt, which can be easily obtained by an attacker, making the encryption even easier to break.",
"recommendation": "Replace the `PBEKeySpec` class with a more secure crypto algorithm, such as AES or RSA. Additionally, use a dynamically generated salt, and increase the iteration count to at least 10,000."}
