        "description": "Using hard-coded values can make the application less flexible and prone to errors. For example, in this case, the iteration count could be set higher or lower than expected, leading to decreased security. Similarly, the key length could be different from what the application expects.",
        "recommendation": "Consider defining these values as constants or parameters in the application configuration. This makes the application more flexible and easier to maintain."
