        "description": "The code snippet provided does not show any implementation of certificate validation for the SSL connection. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks because the client may trust any certificate presented to it without verification.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification and certificate chain validation according to your organization's security policy. Use a custom X509TrustManager to check the server's certificate against a list of trusted certificates or certificate authorities."

        "description": "The hostname is hardcoded into the application, which is not a direct security vulnerability in the context of cryptographic operations, but can be considered a bad practice from a configuration management perspective.",
        "recommendation": "Externalize the hostname configuration to a configurable property file or environment variable, allowing for more flexibility and security in deployment without needing to recompile the code."
