Sure, here is the security analysis of the provided code in JSON format:

```
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"defaultkey\";",
    "description": "The cryptographic key is hard-coded in the source code, which makes it easily accessible to potential attackers.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the cryptographic key dynamically or securely store it in a protected location."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Key-Derivation Function without Salt",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The key derivation function (KDF) is used without a salt, which makes it vulnerable to dictionary attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF with a random salt to generate the cryptographic key."
  }
]
```

In summary, the code suffers from two major crypto API misuses:

1. Hard-coding the cryptographic key in the source code.
2. Using a KDF without a salt.

To fix these issues, it is recommended to generate the cryptographic key dynamically or securely store it in a protected location, and to use a strong KDF with a random salt to generate the cryptographic key.
