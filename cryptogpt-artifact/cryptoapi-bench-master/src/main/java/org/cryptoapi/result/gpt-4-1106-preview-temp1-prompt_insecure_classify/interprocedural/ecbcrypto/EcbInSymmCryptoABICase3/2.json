        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
        "description": "The code uses AES encryption with ECB mode, which is considered less secure because it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality. Each block of plaintext is encrypted independently, which can lead to patterns being visible in the ciphertext when there are repeating blocks of plaintext.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation like CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM. Also, consider adding an Initialization Vector (IV) for these modes."
