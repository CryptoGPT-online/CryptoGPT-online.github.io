    "description": "Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher. However, Blowfish does not specify a key size, which makes it susceptible to side-channel attacks and other timing attacks. If a key of an insecure size is used, an attacker may be able to guess the key, and therefore decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "You should avoid using Blowfish in new code. Instead, use a newer, more secure algorithm such as AES. If you must use Blowfish, always use a key size of 128 bits. If you absolutely cannot do this, generate a new random key every time a key is needed."
