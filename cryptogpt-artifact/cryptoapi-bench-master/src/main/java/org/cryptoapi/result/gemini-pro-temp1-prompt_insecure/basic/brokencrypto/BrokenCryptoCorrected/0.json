    "description": "The code uses the default key size for AES, which is 128 bits. This key size is considered weak and can be broken with a brute-force attack in a reasonable amount of time. This is especially true for sensitive data that needs to be protected for a long period of time.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size, such as AES-256 or AES-192, for sensitive data."

The code in the `BrokenCryptoBBCase1` class uses AES with a 128-bit key size, which is considered weak. This could allow an attacker to break the encryption and access the sensitive data being protected. To fix the issue, a stronger key size should be used.
