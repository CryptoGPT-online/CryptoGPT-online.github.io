        "description": "The code uses the IDEA encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for new systems. It has a small key size of 128 bits, which makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks.",

        "description": "The code uses the getBytes() method to convert a string to a byte array. This method uses the default character encoding, which may not be consistent across different systems. It may also produce insecure or predictable byte arrays if the input string is predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure and consistent method to convert a string to a byte array, such as using a fixed character encoding or generating a random salt."
