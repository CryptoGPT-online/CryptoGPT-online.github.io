{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "defaultAlgo = defAlgo;",
"description": "The cipher algorithm used in the code is vulnerable to attacks, specifically Blowfish. The encryption algorithm should be upgraded to a more secure algorithm such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the Blowfish algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as AES."},

{"misuse": "Insecure Key Generation",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
"description": "The key generation method used in the code is vulnerable to attacks. The keys should be generated using a secure key generation algorithm such as PBKDF2.",
"recommendation": "Replace the key generation method with a secure key generation algorithm such as PBKDF2."},

{"misuse": "Insecure Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
"description": "The key size used in the code is too small, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks. The key size should be increased to a larger size, such as 256 bits.",
"recommendation": "Increase the key size to a larger size, such as 256 bits."},

{"misuse": "Insecure Encryption Mode",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
"description": "The encryption mode used in the code is vulnerable to attacks. The encryption mode should be upgraded to a more secure mode such as GCM.",
