public class P2 {
    public static void main (String [] args){
        SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] seed = new byte[32]; // 256 bits of randomness
        sr.nextBytes(seed);
        int v = sr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
```

This code generates a secure random seed of 256 bits (32 bytes) which should provide more randomness. The `nextInt` method then generates a random integer based on this seed. 

In terms of crypto API misuses, your code doesn't expose any.
