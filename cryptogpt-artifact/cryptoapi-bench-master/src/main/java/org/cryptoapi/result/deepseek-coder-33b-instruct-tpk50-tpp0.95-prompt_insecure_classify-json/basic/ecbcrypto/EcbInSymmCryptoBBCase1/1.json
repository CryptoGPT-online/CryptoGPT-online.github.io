    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The KeyGenerator.getInstance method is used to get an instance of a key generator for the specified algorithm. The AES algorithm is used here, which is a symmetric encryption algorithm. The KeyGenerator.generateKey method is used to generate the key. It uses a default key size for the specified algorithm, but in this case, the AES algorithm key size is fixed at 128 bits. Thus, the generated key may not be random enough, as it is only 128 bits long.",
    "recommendation": "The key size should be increased to at least 256 bits to make the encryption more secure against brute force attacks. AES is a symmetric block cipher, which means it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. If it is possible to upgrade to a different encryption algorithm (like AES-256), you should do so. Additionally, you should make sure the key is generated randomly and securely. For instance, you could use a secure random number generator, which is designed to produce only random numbers. This will ensure that your keys are truly unpredictable and cannot be guessed by an attacker."
