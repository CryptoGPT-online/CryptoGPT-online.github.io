"description": "The encryption mode used in the code is CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. An attacker can use this vulnerability to decrypt the ciphertext and recover the plaintext.",
"recommendation": "Use a modern encryption mode such as GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) or EAX (EAX Mode) instead."
