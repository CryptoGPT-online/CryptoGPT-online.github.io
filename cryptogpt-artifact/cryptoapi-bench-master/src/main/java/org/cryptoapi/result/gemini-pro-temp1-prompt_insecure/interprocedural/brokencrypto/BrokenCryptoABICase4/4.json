    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)",
    "vulnerable_code": "`KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);` and `Cipher.getInstance(crypto);`",
    "description": "The code uses the `crypto` variable to create a `KeyGenerator` and a `Cipher` instance. If the `crypto` variable contains a weak or insecure algorithm (such as RC2), it can lead to a broken crypto algorithm vulnerability.",
    "recommendation": "Use strong and well-known cryptographic algorithms like AES or RSA instead of RC2."
