Explanation:

This code fixes the issue by using SHA-256 as the algorithm. The SHA-256 algorithm produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, which is much stronger and more commonly used.

Note: It is also recommended to handle the hash value properly, especially when you need to represent it as a string. This code converts each byte of the hash value into a two-digit hexadecimal string and concatenates them to produce the final string representation of the hash value.
