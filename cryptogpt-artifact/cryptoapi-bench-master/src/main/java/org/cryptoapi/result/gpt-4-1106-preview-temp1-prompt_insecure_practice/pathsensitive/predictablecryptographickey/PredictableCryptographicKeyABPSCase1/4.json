        "description": "The use of the random.ints() method gives an IntStream, which is not converted to a proper format before being used as a key. Converting the IntStream to a String and then calling getBytes() does not provide cryptographic-strength randomness and could potentially form a weak encryption key.",

        "description": "Using a default string as a key source is insecure as it's predictable and can easily be brute-forced. Additionally, the conversion from String to byte array depends on the default charset and may not use a complete range of byte values.",

        "description": "The use of a static key ('defaultkey') is insecure as it never changes, making it susceptible to repeated use in different encryptions, which can lead to attacks like key reuse attacks in stream ciphers or modes of operation such as ECB.",
        "recommendation": "Keys should be generated dynamically and securely for each encryption operation using SecureRandom, or derived from a passphrase with a strong Key Derivation Function (KDF) like PBKDF2 or Argon2."

        "description": "While AES allows key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, the code seems to assume that the key will always fit into 16 bytes (128 bits) without ensuring this is the case. This may lead to a key of incorrect size if the original array is smaller than 16 bytes or may truncate a larger, more secure key.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that generated keys meet the required size for the intended use. If using 128-bit AES, ensure the key is exactly 16 bytes. If a longer key is desired for a different version of AES, adjust the array copy accordingly."
