    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public class D3 implements X509TrustManager { ... }",
    "description": "The code defines a custom X509TrustManager, but it does not perform any certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods. This means that any certificate will be accepted, which could allow an attacker to impersonate a trusted entity.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods. This can be done by verifying the certificate chain against a trusted root certificate store and checking for any errors or warnings. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure trust manager implementation, such as the `PKIXTrustManager` class."
