        "description": "The `hm.get(\"aaa\")` method retrieves the value associated with the key \"aaa\" in the map. However, the value is not guaranteed to be random, as it is derived from the `Byte` class. This may lead to predictable behavior in the secure random number generation.",

        "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not guaranteed to be secure, as it may use a less secure algorithm during negotiation. This can be a problem if the algorithm is compromised or if the implementation is vulnerable to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a different secure random number generation algorithm, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which is guaranteed to be secure."
