    "description": "The use of AES algorithm is generally secure. However, AES with ECB mode is susceptible to chosen-plaintext attacks and should not be used. Additionally, the use of PKCS5Padding for block ciphers is not recommended as it has security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use AES algorithm with a more secure mode such as CBC or GCM, and use PKCS7Padding instead of PKCS5Padding for block ciphers."
