    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code is using SecureRandom to generate a 32-byte salt for the PBEParameterSpec. However, the SecureRandom instance is not seeded with any non-predictable value, which means the generated salt may not be sufficiently random.",
    "recommendation": "Seeding the SecureRandom instance with a non-predictable value before generating the salt, such as using a system-specific source of entropy or a random number generator provided by the operating system."
