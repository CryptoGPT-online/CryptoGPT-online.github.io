"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\")",
"description": "The use of the RSA algorithm in this code is not secure. RSA with a key size of 1024 bits is considered insecure and can be easily broken. It is recommended to use a secure algorithm with a larger key size, such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the RSA algorithm with a secure algorithm, such as AES, and increase the key size to at least 2048 bits."
