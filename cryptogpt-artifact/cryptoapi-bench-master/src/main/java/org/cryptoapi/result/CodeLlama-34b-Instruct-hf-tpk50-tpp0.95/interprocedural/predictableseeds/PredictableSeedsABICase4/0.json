"description": "The SecureRandom constructor is called with a single byte array argument, which is a potential security vulnerability. The SecureRandom class should be initialized with a SecureRandomParameters object, which provides more security and flexibility.",
"recommendation": "Replace the SecureRandom constructor call with a call to SecureRandom.getInstance(), passing in the appropriate algorithm and SecureRandomParameters object as arguments."

"vulnerable_code": "int v = sr.nextInt()",
"description": "The SecureRandom.nextInt() method generates a random number, but it is not guaranteed to be cryptographically secure. It is possible for an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated by this method, which could compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Replace the SecureRandom.nextInt() method with SecureRandom.nextBytes(), which generates a secure random number that is guaranteed to be cryptographically secure."

"misuse": "Lack of Entropy",
"vulnerable_code": "seed = SEED",
"description": "The seed variable is initialized with a constant value, which reduces the entropy of the random number generation process. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated by the system.",
"recommendation": "Add more entropy to the seed variable by using a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.nextBytes(), to generate the seed value."
