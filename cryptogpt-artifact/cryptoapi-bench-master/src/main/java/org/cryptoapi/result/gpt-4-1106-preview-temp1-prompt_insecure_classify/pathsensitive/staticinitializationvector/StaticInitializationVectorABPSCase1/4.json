    "description": "The code does not specify the key size for the AES encryption algorithm. AES supports 128, 192, or 256 bits key sizes. By default, Java uses 128 bits, which might not be sufficient for certain applications requiring stronger encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly when generating the key to ensure adequate encryption strength, such as 256 bits if supported by the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files."
