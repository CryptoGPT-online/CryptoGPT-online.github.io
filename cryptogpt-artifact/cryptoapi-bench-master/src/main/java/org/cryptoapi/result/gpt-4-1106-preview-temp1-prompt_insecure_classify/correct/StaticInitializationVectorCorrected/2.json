    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "BigInteger i = BigInteger.valueOf(sr.nextInt());\nbyte [] bytes = i.toByteArray();",
    "description": "The code generates an IV using an integer from SecureRandom and converts it to a byte array, potentially leading to a smaller IV size than required for AES (should be 16 bytes) and not sufficiently random due to the predictable length.",
    "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom's nextBytes method to generate a properly sized IV directly."
