    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",

    "description": "The key length of 16 and the iteration count of 11010 are considered to be inadequate for encryption strength, as they may not provide sufficient security against brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length and iteration count to achieve a higher level of encryption strength. For example, consider using a key length of 128 and an iteration count of at least 100,000."
