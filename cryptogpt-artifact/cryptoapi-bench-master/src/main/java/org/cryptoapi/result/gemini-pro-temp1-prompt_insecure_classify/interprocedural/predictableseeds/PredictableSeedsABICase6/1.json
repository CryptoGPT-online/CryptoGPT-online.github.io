    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The `seed` variable is used to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance, which is used to generate a random integer. However, the `seed` variable is only a single byte, which is not sufficient to generate a cryptographically secure random number.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, which uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG). You may also want to pass a larger seed value to the random number generator to make it more difficult to predict."
