    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The setSeed() method is used to set the seed of the SecureRandom instance. The seed should be a random value with sufficient entropy to provide strong randomness. However, in this code, the seed is initialized with a static byte array(DEFAULT_SEED), which may not provide sufficient randomness.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a secure random seed using a cryptographically secure random number generator before setting it in SecureRandom instance."
