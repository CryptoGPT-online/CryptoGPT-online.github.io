"description": "The code uses the MD5 hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be used to create a forgery. It is recommended to use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead.",
"recommendation": "Replace the usage of the MD5 hash algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
