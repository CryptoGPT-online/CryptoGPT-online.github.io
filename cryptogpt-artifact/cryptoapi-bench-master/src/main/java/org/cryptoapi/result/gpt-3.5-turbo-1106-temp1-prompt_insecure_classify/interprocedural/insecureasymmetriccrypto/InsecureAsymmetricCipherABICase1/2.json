    "description": "The code is using the RSA algorithm for key pair generation, which is considered secure. However, the key size of 1024 bits is considered weak and can be easily cracked. It is recommended to use a larger key size (e.g., 2048 bits or more) for better security.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to at least 2048 bits."
