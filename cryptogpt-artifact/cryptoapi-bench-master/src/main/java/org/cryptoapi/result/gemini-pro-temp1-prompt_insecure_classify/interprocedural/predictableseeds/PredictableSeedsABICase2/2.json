    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a single byte as the seed, which is not sufficient to generate unpredictable random numbers. An attacker could potentially guess the seed and predict the random numbers generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger seed, such as one generated from a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) or a combination of multiple sources of randomness."
