 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "crypto.method1()",
"description": "The method1() method uses the JKS (Java Key Store) algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used in new code. The JKS algorithm is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and is not considered secure.",
"recommendation": "Replace the JKS algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as the BKS (Bouncy Castle Key Store) algorithm or the JCEKS (Java Cryptography Extension Key Store) algorithm. These algorithms are more secure and provide better protection against dictionary attacks."
