    "vulnerable_code": "public class D3 implements X509TrustManager { ... }",
    "description": "The class `D3` implements the `X509TrustManager` interface without performing any certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods. This means that any certificate will be accepted, which is insecure.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this, the certificate validation should be implemented in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods. This can be done by using the `X509Certificate` methods `verify` and `getBasicConstraints` to check the validity of the certificate."
