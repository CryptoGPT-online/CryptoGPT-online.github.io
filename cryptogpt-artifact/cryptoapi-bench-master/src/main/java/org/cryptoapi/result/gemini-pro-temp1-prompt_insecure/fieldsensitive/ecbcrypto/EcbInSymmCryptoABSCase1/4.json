    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which is vulnerable to various attacks. ECB mode encrypts each block of plaintext independently, which can lead to predictable patterns in the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)."
