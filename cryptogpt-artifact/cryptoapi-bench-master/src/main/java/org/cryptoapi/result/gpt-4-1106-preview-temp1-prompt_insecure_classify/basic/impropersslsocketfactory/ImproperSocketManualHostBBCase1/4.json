        "vulnerable_code": "ssf.createSocket(\"my.host.name\", 443)",
        "description": "The code snippet does not demonstrate any form of custom certificate validation, such as hostname verification or checking against a list of trusted certificates. It relies on the default Java SSL socket, which might not be secure depending on the runtime environment and trust store configuration.",
        "recommendation": "Implement and enforce proper certificate validation by using a custom `X509TrustManager` and/or `HostnameVerifier`. Ensure that the trust manager checks that the certificate presented by the server matches a trusted certificate and that the hostname verifier ensures the hostname in the certificate matches the hostname of the server being connected to."
