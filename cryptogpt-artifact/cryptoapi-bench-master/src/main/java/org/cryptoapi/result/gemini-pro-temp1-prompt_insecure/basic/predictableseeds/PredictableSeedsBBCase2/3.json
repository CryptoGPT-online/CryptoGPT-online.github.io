    "misuse": "Insufficient Entropy (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "Using a single byte as the seed for `SecureRandom` is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. An attacker could easily guess the seed and predict the generated values.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (such as `java.security.SecureRandom`) with a strong seed, such as one generated from a hardware random number generator or a combination of multiple sources of entropy."
