[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The password is generated using the random.ints() method, which returns a stream of pseudorandom int values. This is not a secure method for generating a password as it lacks sufficient randomness.", "recommendation": "Generate a secure random password using a cryptographically secure random number generator (such as SecureRandom) and a strong password generation algorithm (such as using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters)."}]
