[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();", 
  "description": "The SecureRandom class is being used to generate a random number for the salt, but the code does not specify a specific algorithm or provider for the SecureRandom object. This can lead to a weak random number generator being used, which can compromise the security of the cryptographic operation.",
