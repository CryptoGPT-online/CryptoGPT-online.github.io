        "vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed})",
        "description": "The `SecureRandom` constructor with a `byte[]` argument is used to set the seed for the random number generation. However, the seed is a single `byte` value, which is not sufficient to provide a proper seed for the secure random number generator. This could lead to predictable and vulnerable random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper seed for the secure random number generator, such as a secure random seed provided by the `SecureRandom` class itself, or a secure random seed from a trusted source such as the OS or a hardware random number generator."
