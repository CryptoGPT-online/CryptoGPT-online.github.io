"description": "The `PBEParameterSpec` class is used to generate a pseudo-random key for password-based encryption, but it uses a fixed key size of 16 bytes, which is not secure for modern key sizes. This can lead to a weak key being generated, which can be easily guessed or cracked by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key generation algorithm such as `PBKDF2` or `scrypt` instead of `PBEParameterSpec` to generate the key. Additionally, make sure to use a secure password hashing algorithm such as `bcrypt` or `argon2` to store the password securely."

"description": "The `PBEParameterSpec` class is used to generate a pseudo-random key for password-based encryption, but the salt used is not secure. The salt should be generated randomly for each user and should be stored securely, ideally using a secure key-value store or a database with strong security measures in place.",
