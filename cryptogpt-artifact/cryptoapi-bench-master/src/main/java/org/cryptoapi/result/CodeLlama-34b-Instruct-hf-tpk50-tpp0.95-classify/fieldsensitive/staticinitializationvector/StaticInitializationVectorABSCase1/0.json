"description": "The use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for encryption purposes. It is vulnerable to attacks such as padding oracle attacks and IV attacks. The algorithm should be updated to a more secure algorithm such as AES-GCM or AES-CBC with a secure padding scheme such as PKCS7.",
"recommendation": "Change the algorithm to a more secure one and use a secure padding scheme. Additionally, consider using a library that automatically selects a secure algorithm and padding scheme based on the given input. "
