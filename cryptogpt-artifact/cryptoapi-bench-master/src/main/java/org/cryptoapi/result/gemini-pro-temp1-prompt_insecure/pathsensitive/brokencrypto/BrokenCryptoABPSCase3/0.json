    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses AES with a key generated by `KeyGenerator`, which is not sufficient to protect sensitive data. AES keys should be at least 128 bits long, but the code does not specify a specific key length, so the generated key may be too short.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure key generation method, such as `SecureRandom` or `KeyAgreement`, and specify a key length of at least 128 bits."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Data Exposure",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RC4\");",
    "description": "The code uses RC4, which is a known weak algorithm and should not be used for encryption. RC4 is susceptible to various attacks, including key recovery attacks and collisions, which can lead to plaintext data exposure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses the CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data by manipulating the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption mode, such as GCM or CTR, with a secure padding scheme, such as OAEP."
