    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code generates a 32-byte salt using `SecureRandom`'s `nextBytes` method. However, generating a salt of a fixed size is not considered secure. An attacker could potentially guess the salt if it is of a predictable size.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a salt of a variable size, typically between 16 and 32 bytes. Additionally, consider using a salt derivation function, such as PBKDF2, to strengthen the salt."
