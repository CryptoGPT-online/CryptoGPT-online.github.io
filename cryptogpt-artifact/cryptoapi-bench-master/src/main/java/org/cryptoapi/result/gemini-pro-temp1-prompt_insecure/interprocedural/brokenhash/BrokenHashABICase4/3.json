    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MD2 algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. MD2 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be exploited to create digital signatures that cannot be verified or to impersonate other users.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
