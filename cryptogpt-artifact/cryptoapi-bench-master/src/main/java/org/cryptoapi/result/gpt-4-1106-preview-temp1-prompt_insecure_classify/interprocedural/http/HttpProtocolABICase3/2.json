The code provided does not involve any crypto API usages. It simply demonstrates strings being passed through methods and a URL object being created and printed. There are no cryptographic algorithms, certificate validations, random value generations, or hardcoded credentials being utilized in this code snippet. Therefore, there are no crypto API misuses to report within the context of the code given. If you have a different code snippet that includes cryptographic operations, I would be happy to review that.
