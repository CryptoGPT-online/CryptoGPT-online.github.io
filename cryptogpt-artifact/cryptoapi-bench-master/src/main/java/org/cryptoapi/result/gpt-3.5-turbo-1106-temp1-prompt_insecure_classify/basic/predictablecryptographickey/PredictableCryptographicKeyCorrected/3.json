[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\")", "description": "The code uses AES algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding, which is outdated and considered to be less secure compared to modern algorithms and padding schemes.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 and use an authenticated encryption mode."}, {"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();String defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The code uses a single call to generate a random number to create a key for encryption.
