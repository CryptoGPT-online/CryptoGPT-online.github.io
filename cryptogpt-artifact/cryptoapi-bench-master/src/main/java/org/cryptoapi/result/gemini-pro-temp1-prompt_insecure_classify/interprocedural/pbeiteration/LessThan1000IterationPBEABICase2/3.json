```

**CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**

The provided code uses the `SecureRandom` class without a seed. This means that the generated random numbers may be predictable, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

**CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**

The provided code uses an insufficient iteration count for the PBKDF2 algorithm. A low iteration count makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.

**Recommendation**

To fix these misuses, you should:

* Use a strong random number generator (RNG) with a good entropy source, such as `java.security.SecureRandom` with a seed obtained from a secure random number generator or a hardware RNG.
* Use a sufficiently high iteration count for the PBKDF2 algorithm, such as at least 100,000 iterations.
