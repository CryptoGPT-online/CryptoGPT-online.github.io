    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The code uses the RC4 algorithm for encryption which is insecure. The RC4 algorithm was broken because of its key size which is too small. It is recommended to use a stronger encryption algorithm like AES.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'RC4' with a more secure encryption algorithm like 'AES', 'DES', or 'Blowfish'. If you can't change 'RC4' to another algorithm, try using a strong key."
