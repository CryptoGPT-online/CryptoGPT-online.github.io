  "description": "The key is derived from a string literal and then directly converted to bytes, and then truncated to a specific length. This is an insecure way to generate a key for encryption.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a secure random key generation method such as SecureRandom to generate cryptographic keys. Additionally, consider using a key derivation function like PBKDF2 to derive a key from a password."}]
