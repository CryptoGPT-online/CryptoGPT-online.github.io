"description": "The use of a broken cryptographic algorithm, such as Blowfish, which is considered insecure. This algorithm has been vulnerable to various types of attacks, including linear and differential cryptanalysis.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or RSA, instead of Blowfish. It is also recommended to use a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS#7, to prevent padding attacks."
