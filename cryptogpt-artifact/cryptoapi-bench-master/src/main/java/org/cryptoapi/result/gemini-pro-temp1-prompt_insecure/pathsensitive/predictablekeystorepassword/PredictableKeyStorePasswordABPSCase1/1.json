    "description": "The code generates a password using `SecureRandom.ints()` which is not suitable for generating cryptographically strong passwords. It should use a more secure random number generator like `SecureRandom.generateSeed()` or `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, the password should be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) with sufficient entropy.",

    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded password, \"changeit\", which is insecure and easily guessable. Hard-coded passwords should be avoided, especially when used to protect sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating passwords, such as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or a password manager."
