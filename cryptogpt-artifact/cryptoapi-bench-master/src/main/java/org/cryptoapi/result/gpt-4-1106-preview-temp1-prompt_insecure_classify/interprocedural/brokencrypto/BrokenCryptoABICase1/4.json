        "description": "The use of DES with a 56-bit key is inadequate for encryption strength, as it can be broken relatively easily with modern computing resources.",

        "description": "ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols because it does not provide serious message confidentiality; identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks, thus it does not hide data patterns well.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM which provide better data pattern obfuscation."
