"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Blowfish",
"description": "The use of Blowfish algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It has been shown to be vulnerable to various attacks, such as differential and linear cryptanalysis.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure and widely used algorithm, such as AES, GCM, or EAX."

"misuse": "Insufficient Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "key.generateKey()",
"description": "The key size generated by the key generator is not specified, which could result in a key size that is not strong enough to provide adequate security. It is recommended to specify a key size that is at least 256 bits.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and widely used key size, such as 256 bits or higher."

"misuse": "Insecure Mode",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE",
"description": "The cipher is being used in encrypt mode, which is vulnerable to attacks such as plaintext recovery and padding oracle attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure mode, such as GCM or EAX.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure mode, such as GCM or EAX."
