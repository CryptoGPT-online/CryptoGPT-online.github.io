"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The `MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)` method uses the algorithm specified in the `crypto` parameter to perform a cryptographic operation. However, this method does not check if the algorithm is supported by the underlying Java platform. Therefore, it is possible to use an unsupported algorithm, which can result in a security vulnerability.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, you should verify that the `crypto` parameter is a supported algorithm. You can do this by using the `MessageDigest.getAlgorithms()` method to obtain a list of supported algorithms, and then checking if the `crypto` parameter is in the list. If it is not, you should throw an exception or take other appropriate action."

"vulnerable_code": "method1(str2,hashAlgo);",
"description": "The `method1` method uses the `MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)` method to perform a cryptographic operation. However, the `hashAlgo` parameter is passed directly to the `getMessageDigest` method without any validation or sanitization. This can result in a security vulnerability if an attacker is able to specify an insecure or unsupported algorithm.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, you should validate and sanitize the `hashAlgo` parameter before passing it to the `getMessageDigest` method. You can do this by using a regular expression or other mechanism to ensure that the `hashAlgo` parameter is a valid and supported algorithm."

However, the `cryptoHash` parameter is passed directly to the `method1` method without any validation or sanitization. This can result in a security vulnerability if an attacker is able to specify an insecure or unsupported algorithm.",
