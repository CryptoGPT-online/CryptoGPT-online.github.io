        "description": "The use of `sr.nextInt()` generates a number that is not sufficiently large to ensure a strong Initialization Vector (IV) for AES CBC mode encryption. This may lead to a weak IV that could compromise encryption.",

        "description": "The key size for AES is not explicitly defined, which means it might default to a weak key size depending on the provider. Typically, 128 bits is the default but it's not guaranteed across all providers.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly by using `keyGen.init(256);` to ensure a strong key size, such as 256 bits for AES."
