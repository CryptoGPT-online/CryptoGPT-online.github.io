        "description": "The method uses the algorithm passed in as a parameter to generate a secret key and to encrypt the input text. However, if the passed in algorithm is empty, the method falls back to using the default algorithm, which is hardcoded to 'RC4'. RC4 is a broken encryption algorithm and should not be used in new code. This can lead to the encryption being easily broken by an attacker.",
