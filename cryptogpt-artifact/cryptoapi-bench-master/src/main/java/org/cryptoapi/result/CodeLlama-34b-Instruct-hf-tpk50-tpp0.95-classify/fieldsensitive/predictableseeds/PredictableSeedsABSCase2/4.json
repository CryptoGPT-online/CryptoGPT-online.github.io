        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});",
        "description": "The `SecureRandom` constructor is used with a single byte as the seed. This can be a security misuse because it can be easily guessed and reduce the randomness of the generated output.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger seed, such as a `byte[]` with a length of at least 20, and use a proper secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."
