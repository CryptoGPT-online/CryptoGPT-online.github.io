"description": "The method is using the default Java URL constructor to create a URL object from a user-provided string, which can lead to a vulnerability known as the 'Open Redirect' attack. An attacker can manipulate the user-provided URL to redirect the user to a malicious website, leading to phishing or other attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure method to create a URL object, such as the `java.net.URL` class with a `protocol` parameter set to `https` to ensure that the URL is secure."
