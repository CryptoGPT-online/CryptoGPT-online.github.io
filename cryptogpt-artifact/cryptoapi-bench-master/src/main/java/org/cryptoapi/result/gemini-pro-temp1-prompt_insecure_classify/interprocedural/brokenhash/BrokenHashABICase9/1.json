    "description": "`SHA-1` is a broken cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be used to forge digital signatures and other security-sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`."
