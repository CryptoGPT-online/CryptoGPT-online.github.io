    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses Cipher.getInstance(crypto) to create a new Cipher object without checking if the underlying provider is trustworthy or not. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to provide a malicious provider.",
    "recommendation": "Use a security-approved provider to create the Cipher object. For example, you can use the `Provider.getProvider(String provider)` method to get a provider by its name and then use it to create the Cipher object."
