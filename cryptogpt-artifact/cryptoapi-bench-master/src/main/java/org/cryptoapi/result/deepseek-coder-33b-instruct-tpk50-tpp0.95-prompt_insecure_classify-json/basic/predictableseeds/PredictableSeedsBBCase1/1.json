    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "The use of a hardcoded seed (bytes array) in the SecureRandom instance may produce predictable results and could potentially allow an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a hardcoded seed, the seed should be generated securely from a high-quality random number source. For instance, the SecureRandom class can be used to generate a seed from the operating system's random number generator."
