 {"misuses":[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code":"PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(encryptKey,salt,10000,16);",
"description": "The use of the PBEKeySpec with a low iteration number and short key size is considered a risky or broken cryptographic algorithm. This can be exploited by attackers to perform attacks such as brute force attacks or dictionary attacks.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, it is recommended to use a stronger and more secure cryptographic algorithm with a higher iteration number and longer key size. Additionally, it is important to use a salt that is unique and unpredictable for each encryption operation."}]}
