    "description": "The code is using the MD5 cryptographic algorithm, which is considered broken and unsafe for many cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and should not be used for secure hashing or checksum operations.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the usage of MD5 with a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256."
