[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\r\nlong l = sr.nextLong();\r\nsr.setSeed(l);", "description": "The use of SecureRandom's `setSeed` method with a single long value is not sufficient for secure random number generation. Recalling the same seed will result in the same random number sequence, which can lead to predictable values.", "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without manually seeding it to ensure sufficient randomness."}]
