The provided code uses a constant seed value (`byte[] bytes`) to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance. This is considered insecure because attackers can easily guess the initial seed state and predict subsequent random numbers. To fix this issue, one should use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that generates unpredictable and non-repeating values.
