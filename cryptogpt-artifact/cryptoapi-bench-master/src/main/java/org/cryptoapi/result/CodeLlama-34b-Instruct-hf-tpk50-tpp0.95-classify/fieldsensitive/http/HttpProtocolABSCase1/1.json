        "vulnerable_code": "new URL(passedURL)",
        "description": "The method `C1.method1()` uses the `new URL(String url)` constructor to create a URL object, which is a deprecated method that does not provide proper validation of the URL. This can lead to attacks such as DNS rebinding or man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure method such as `URI.create(String uri)` or `URL.parse(String url, boolean strict)` to create a URL object."
