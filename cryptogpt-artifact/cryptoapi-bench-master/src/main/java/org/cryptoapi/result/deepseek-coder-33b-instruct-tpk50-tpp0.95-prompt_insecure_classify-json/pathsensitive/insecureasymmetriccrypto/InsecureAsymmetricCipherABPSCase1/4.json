    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator kgp = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");",
    "description": "This code is using the RSA algorithm for key generation and encryption. However, the RSA algorithm is not considered broken or risky, but its key length of 1024 is considered weak. The choice of the key size depends on a variable choice. If the choice is greater than 1, the key size will be 2048, otherwise, it will be 1024. As such, this program can have cryptographic keys with insecure lengths, making it insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a fixed key size, consider using a method of key size derivation from a password or passphrase. Also, consider using a more secure algorithm like AES."
