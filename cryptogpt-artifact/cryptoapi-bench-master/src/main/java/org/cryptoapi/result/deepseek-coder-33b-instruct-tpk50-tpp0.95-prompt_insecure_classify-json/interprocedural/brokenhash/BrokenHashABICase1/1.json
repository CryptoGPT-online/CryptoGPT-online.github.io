        "description": "The SHA1 hash algorithm is a known weak hash function that is considered risky and broken. It's easy to generate a hash collision and this is a problem if you need to protect against someone knowing the original data.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
```

In addition, SHA1 is not considered secure for use in digital signatures, as it's possible to generate collisions. It's recommended to use SHA-256 or SHA-3.
