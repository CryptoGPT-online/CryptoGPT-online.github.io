"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The method `MessageDigest.getInstance()` is used to obtain a `MessageDigest` object that can perform cryptographic hash functions. However, the `crypto` parameter is user-controlled, which means that an attacker can provide a malicious value that can lead to a vulnerability. In this case, the attacker can provide the string `MD5`, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm that can be used for hash function collision attacks.",
"recommendation": "The `MessageDigest` class provides several methods for obtaining a `MessageDigest` object, such as `getInstance(String algorithm)`, `getInstance(String algorithm, String provider)`, and `getInstance(String algorithm, Provider provider)`. It is recommended to use one of these methods instead of `getInstance(String crypto)` and to validate the `crypto` parameter to ensure that it is a valid cryptographic algorithm."
