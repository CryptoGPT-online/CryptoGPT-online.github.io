    "description": "The initialization vector (IV) for AES/CBC mode is not randomly generated, instead it is derived from a static, non-random string, leading to predictable IVs. Using a predictable IV undermines the security of the encryption by making it vulnerable to certain types of attacks.",

    "description": "The IV generation method is weak. Parsing a single byte from a static string does not create a sufficiently large IV for AES/CBC, and as such, it does not provide the necessary security guarantees for a strong IV. Typically, an IV should be as large as the AES block size (16 bytes).",

    "description": "The key generator does not specify a key size, which may lead to generating weak keys if the default size is not adequate. For AES, key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits are considered secure, but the default size may vary depending on the Java implementation.",

    "recommendation": "Remove the static keyword from the INITIALIZATION array declaration and ensure that a unique IV is used for every encryption operation."
