    "description": "The code is using a SecureRandom instance to generate a salt, but it does not specify a source of randomness. This means that the SecureRandom instance may not be properly seeded, resulting in a predictable salt.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator that is properly seeded, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate the salt."
