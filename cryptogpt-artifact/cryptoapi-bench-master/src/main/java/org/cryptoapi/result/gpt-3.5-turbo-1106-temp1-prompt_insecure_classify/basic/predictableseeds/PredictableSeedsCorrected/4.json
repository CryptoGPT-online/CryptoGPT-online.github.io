[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", 
"vulnerable_code": "long l = sr.nextLong();\nsr.setSeed(l);\nint v = sr.nextInt();", 
"description": "The code is using a single random value generated from SecureRandom.nextLong() to seed the SecureRandom instance. This can lead to predictable and weak random values, as the seed may have low entropy. Additionally, calling setSeed() with a single value reduces the randomization process. Finally, generating a single random number with nextInt() may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", 
"recommendation": "Instead of using a single random value as a seed, it is recommended to generate a sufficient amount of random data and use that as the seed for SecureRandom. Also, generating multiple random values using nextInt() or nextBytes() can provide better randomness for cryptographic purposes."}]
