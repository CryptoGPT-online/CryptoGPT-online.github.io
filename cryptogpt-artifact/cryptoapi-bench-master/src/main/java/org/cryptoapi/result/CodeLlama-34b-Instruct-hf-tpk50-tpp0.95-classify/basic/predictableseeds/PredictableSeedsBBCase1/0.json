"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};\n        sr.setSeed(bytes);",
"description": "The random seed is not generated securely, and the byte array is hardcoded. This can lead to predictable and weak random numbers, which can compromise the security of the cryptographic algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as the `java.security.SecureRandom` class, to generate the random seed. Avoid hardcoding random seeds and use secure and unpredictable methods to generate them."
