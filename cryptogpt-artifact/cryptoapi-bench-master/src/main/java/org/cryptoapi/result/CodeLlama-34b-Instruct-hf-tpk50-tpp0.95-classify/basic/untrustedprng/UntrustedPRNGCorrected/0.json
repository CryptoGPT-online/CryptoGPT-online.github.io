        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\n        int x = random.nextInt();",
        "description": "The use of the `SecureRandom` class is a potential misuse as it uses a broken algorithm that is not designed to be cryptographically secure. The `nextInt()` method is also not recommended as it can be predicted easily.",
        "recommendation": "Instead, use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) such as `java.security.SecureRandom` or `com.google.common.base.Crypto`. These classes provide a more secure way of generating random numbers and can be used to replace the use of `SecureRandom`."
