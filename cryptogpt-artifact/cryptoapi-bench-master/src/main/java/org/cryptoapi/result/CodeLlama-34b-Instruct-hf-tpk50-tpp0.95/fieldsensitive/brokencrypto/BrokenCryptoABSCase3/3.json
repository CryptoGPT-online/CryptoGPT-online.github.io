"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new C4(\"RC4\")",
"description": "The use of RC4 algorithm is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including the Flamingo attack, which can allow an attacker to recover the encryption key. RC4 is also known to have a high rate of collisions, which can result in the same output for different input values.",
"recommendation": "Replace RC4 with a secure and widely adopted encryption algorithm such as AES."
