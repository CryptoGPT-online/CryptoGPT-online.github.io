    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();\nint x = randomGenerator.nextInt();",
    "description": "The code uses the Random class from the Java standard library to generate a random integer. However, the Random class uses a linear congruential algorithm which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. This means that the generated random values may not be sufficiently unpredictable and secure.",
    "recommendation": "For cryptographic purposes, it is recommended to use the SecureRandom class instead of Random. SecureRandom is designed specifically for generating secure random numbers. Replace 'Random randomGenerator = new Random();' with 'SecureRandom randomGenerator = new SecureRandom();'"
