    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;",
    "description": "The `pbeParamSpec` variable is initialized to `null`, which means that no encryption will be performed. This is a serious security issue because it leaves the data unencrypted and vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong encryption algorithm and key size, and ensure that the `pbeParamSpec` variable is properly initialized with appropriate values."

    "description": "The use of `PBEParameterSpec` with a weak or outdated algorithm is a security risk. `PBEParameterSpec` is a legacy class that should not be used for new development.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-256 or ChaCha20, and consider using a modern key derivation function such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt."

    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "Generating a salt using `SecureRandom` is not secure because the salt is generated using a fixed seed, which makes it predictable and vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a cryptographically strong salt. Consider using a password hashing function, such as bcrypt or scrypt, which automatically generates a salt and hashes the password securely."
