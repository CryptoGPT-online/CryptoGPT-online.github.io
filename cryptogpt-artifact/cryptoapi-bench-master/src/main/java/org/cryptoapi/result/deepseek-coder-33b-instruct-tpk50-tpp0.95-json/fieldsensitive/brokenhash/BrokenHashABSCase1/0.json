    "vulnerable_code": "crypto = new C1(\"SHA1\");",
    "description": "The code creates an instance of class C1 with SHA1 as the default encryption algorithm. SHA1 is a cryptographic hash function that provides secure hash algorithms 1. It is not suitable for further processing and should be avoided because it may be broken and could be subject to collision attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use stronger hash functions like SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2 or bcrypt to secure hash sensitive information."
