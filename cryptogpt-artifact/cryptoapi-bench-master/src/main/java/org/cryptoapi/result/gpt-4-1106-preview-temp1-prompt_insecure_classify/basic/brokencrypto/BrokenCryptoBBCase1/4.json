        "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered insecure due to its key size of 56 bits being too small by today's standards, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Additionally, using ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode for encryption is not recommended because it does not provide serious message confidentiality; identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm like AES with a key size of at least 128 bits, and switch to a more secure mode of operation such as CBC, GCM, or CTR."
