    "description": "The use of PBEKeySpec with a weak key derivation function (KDF) such as PBKDF2 with a low iteration count can make it easier for attackers to brute-force the password and compromise the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger KDF such as bcrypt or scrypt with a higher iteration count (e.g., 100,000 or more) to make it more difficult for attackers to crack the password."
