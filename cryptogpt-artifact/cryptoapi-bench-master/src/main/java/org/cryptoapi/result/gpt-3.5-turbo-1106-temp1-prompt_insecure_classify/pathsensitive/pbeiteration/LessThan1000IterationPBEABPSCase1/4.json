    "description": "The SecureRandom object is used to generate random values for the salt. However, the salt size is defined as 32 bytes, which may not be sufficient for strong cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the size of the salt to at least 128 bits (16 bytes) or more to ensure sufficient randomness."
