    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a salt for the key derivation function. However, it does not specify a source of randomness for the `SecureRandom` instance. This means that the generated salt may not be sufficiently random, which could compromise the security of the key derivation process.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, the code should specify a secure source of randomness for the `SecureRandom` instance. This can be done by using `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` or by providing a `SecureRandom` instance that is seeded with a strong source of randomness."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The code uses a key length of 16 bytes, which is only 128 bits. This is considered to be insecure by modern standards, as it is susceptible to brute-force attacks. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits for symmetric encryption.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, the code should increase the key length to at least 256 bits."
