    "description": "The code uses a single byte as the seed for the SecureRandom instance, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed for the SecureRandom instance. For example, use a combination of the current time, a random device, and a secret key."
