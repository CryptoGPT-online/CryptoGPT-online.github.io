[{
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code is creating an AES key with a length of 128 bits, which is a low level of encryption. The NIST recommended length for symmetric keys is at least 112 bits. With shorter key lengths, the protection against brute force attacks is significantly reduced.",
    "recommendation": "You should use a higher level of encryption, preferably a 256-bit key. You can do this by modifying the KeyGenerator initialization like so: KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\", \"BC\"); instead of KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");"
