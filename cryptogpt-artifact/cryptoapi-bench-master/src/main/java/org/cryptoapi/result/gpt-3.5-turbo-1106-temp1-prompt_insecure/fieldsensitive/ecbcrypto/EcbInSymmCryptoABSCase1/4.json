"description": "The code is using Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode which is known to have security vulnerabilities and is not recommended. ECB mode does not provide serious message confidentiality and it is not semantically secure. It should not be used in secure systems.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure mode like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) instead of ECB."}]
