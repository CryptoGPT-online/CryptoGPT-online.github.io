    "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Key Storage",
    "vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = \"changeit\";",
    "description": "Storing cryptographic keys in plaintext increases the risk of unauthorized access and key compromise. Using static or hardcoded keys reduces the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a secure key management system or a hardware security module (HSM) to store cryptographic keys. Additionally, keys should be rotated regularly to limit the impact of key compromise."

  {
    "misuse": "CWE-547: Unprotected Key Transport",
    "vulnerable_code": "URL cacerts = new URL(\"https://www.google.com\");",
    "description": "Transmitting cryptographic keys over an insecure channel increases the risk of interception and key compromise. Sending keys over public networks or unencrypted channels can allow attackers to eavesdrop and obtain the keys.",
    "recommendation": "Encrypt or protect cryptographic keys during transmission to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Consider using secure protocols such as TLS or SSH for key transport."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-756: Use of Weak or Insecure Cipher",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
    "description": "Using a weak or insecure cipher algorithm can compromise the confidentiality or integrity of encrypted data. The choice of cipher should consider factors such as key size, algorithm strength, and resistance to cryptanalysis.",
    "recommendation": "Select a strong and secure cipher algorithm that is appropriate for the specific application and data sensitivity. Consider using industry-standard and well-tested algorithms such as AES, RSA, or ECC."
