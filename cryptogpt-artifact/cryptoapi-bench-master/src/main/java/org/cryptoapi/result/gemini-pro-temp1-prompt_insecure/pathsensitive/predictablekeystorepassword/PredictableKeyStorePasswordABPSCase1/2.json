    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\ndefaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` to generate a key for the keystore. However, it doesn't specify the algorithm to use for generating the key. This can result in a weak key being generated, which can be easily broken.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator (RNG) algorithm such as `SHA1PRNG` or `SHA256PRNG` to generate the key. Additionally, consider using a key derivation function (KDF) to strengthen the key."
