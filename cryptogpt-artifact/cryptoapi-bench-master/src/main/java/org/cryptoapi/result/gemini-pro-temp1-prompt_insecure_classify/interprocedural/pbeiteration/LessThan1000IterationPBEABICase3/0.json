    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[])` to generate a salt for the PBE encryption. This method is known to be insecure when used with a small array, as it may generate weak or predictable values. This is especially problematic when used in a security context, such as when generating salts for encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using `SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[])` with a small array, it is recommended to use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and generate a larger salt value."
