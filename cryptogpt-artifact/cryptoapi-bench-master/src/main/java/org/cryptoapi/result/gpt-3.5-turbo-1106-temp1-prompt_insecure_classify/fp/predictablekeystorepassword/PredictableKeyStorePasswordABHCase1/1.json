[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());","description": "The code uses random.ints() to generate a password, which does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes. The generated password may be easily predictable or guessable.", "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., java.security.SecureRandom) to generate a strong and unpredictable password."},{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), new String(keyBytes).toCharArray());","description": "The code uses a weak password as the key to load the keystore. The strength of the encryption depends on the strength of the password. Using a weak password reduces the encryption strength and makes the system more vulnerable to attacks.","recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure password with sufficient length, complexity, and entropy to enhance the encryption strength of the keystore. Consider using a key derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2) with a high iteration count to strengthen the password-based key derivation process."}]
