    "description": "The cryptographic key (hostname and socket) is hardcoded in the code, which makes it easy for attackers to obtain and use to decrypt or forge messages.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding cryptographic keys. Instead, use a secure method to generate and store the keys, such as a key management system (KMS) or a hardware security module (HSM)."
