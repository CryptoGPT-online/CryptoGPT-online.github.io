Sure, here is the JSON report of the crypto API misuses I found in the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "String key = \"changeit\"",
    "description": "The cryptographic key is hardcoded in the code, which could be easily compromised if the attacker gains access to the code.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure method of key generation, such as generating a random key at runtime."
  }
]
```

This code uses a hardcoded cryptographic key, which is a common vulnerability. Hardcoded keys are easy for attackers to find and exploit. Instead, you should use a key that is generated randomly and stored securely.

To fix this issue, you can use a library to generate a secure key for you. For example, the Java SecureRandom class can be used to generate a random key. You can then store the key securely in a keystore or other secure location.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
