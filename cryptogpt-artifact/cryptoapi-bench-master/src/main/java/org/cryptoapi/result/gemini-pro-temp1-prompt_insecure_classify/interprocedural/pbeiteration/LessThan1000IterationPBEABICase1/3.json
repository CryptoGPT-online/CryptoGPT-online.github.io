    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code generates a 32-byte salt for the PBEParameterSpec using the SecureRandom class. However, 32 bytes is not a sufficient amount of entropy for a salt value. A longer salt value is recommended, at least 64 bytes.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the size of the salt array to provide more entropy. For example, using a salt array of size 64 or 128 bytes would be more secure."
