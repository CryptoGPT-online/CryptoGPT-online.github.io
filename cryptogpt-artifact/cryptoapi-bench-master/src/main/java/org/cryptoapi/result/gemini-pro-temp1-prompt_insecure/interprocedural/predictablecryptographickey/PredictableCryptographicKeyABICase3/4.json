    "description": "The key is derived from a String using the `getBytes()` method, which uses the default platform encoding. This may lead to weak keys if the encoding is not appropriate for the algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a strong key, or derive the key from a password using a key derivation function (KDF) such as PBKDF2."
