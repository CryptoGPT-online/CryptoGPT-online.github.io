  "description": "By setting the seed of the SecureRandom instance to a value that was just generated by the same instance, you are potentially reducing the entropy available for subsequent random number generation, which can make the random numbers predictable.",
  "recommendation": "Do not manually set the seed for SecureRandom with a value that was generated by the SecureRandom instance itself; allow the SecureRandom instance to self-seed with its default entropy sources."
