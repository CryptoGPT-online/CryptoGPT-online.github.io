{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
 "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n    return true;\n}",
 "description": "The implementation of the verify method in class D1 returns true unconditionally, indicating that it skips the verification of the SSL certificate presented by the remote server. This means that the code is not properly validating the server certificate, which can lead to a risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.",
 "recommendation": "Ensure that the verify method properly validates the SSL certificate by implementing appropriate logic to check the certificate chain, its expiration, and its integrity. Consider using a trusted certificate authority and enabling revocation checking for enhanced security."}
