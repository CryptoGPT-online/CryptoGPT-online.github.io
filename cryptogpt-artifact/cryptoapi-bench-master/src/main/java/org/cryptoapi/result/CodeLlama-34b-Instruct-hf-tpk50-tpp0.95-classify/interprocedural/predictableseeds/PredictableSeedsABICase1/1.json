 {
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The provided seed is not securely generated and may not be random enough. Using a static seed like this can make it easier for attackers to predict the output of the random number generator and potentially compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator or a secure seed instead. For example, you can use SecureRandom() to generate random bytes."
