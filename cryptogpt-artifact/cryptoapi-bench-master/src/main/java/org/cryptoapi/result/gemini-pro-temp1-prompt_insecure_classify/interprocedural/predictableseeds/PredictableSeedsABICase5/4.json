    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. However, in this case, the seed used to initialize the SecureRandom object is not sufficiently random. The seed is generated using the `new byte[]{(byte) 100, (byte) 200}` statement, which always produces the same sequence of bytes. This means that the generated random numbers will be predictable and not secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate a random seed. CSPRNGs are designed to generate unpredictable and non-repeating sequences of bytes. Some examples of CSPRNGs include `java.security.SecureRandom` and `java.util.Random`."
