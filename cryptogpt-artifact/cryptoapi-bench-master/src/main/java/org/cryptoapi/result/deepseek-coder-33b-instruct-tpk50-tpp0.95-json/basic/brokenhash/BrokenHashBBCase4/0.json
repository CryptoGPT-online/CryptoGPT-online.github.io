        "description": "MD2 is an old cryptographic hash function which is insecure and no longer recommended for use due to a vulnerability discovered in 2004. The MD2 algorithm produces 128 bits of output, while the expected output of collision resistance is 2^n where n>=128, which is a very low value. Thus, collision attacks on MD2 are practically feasible.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using more secure hash algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, or if high security and speed is required, consider using bcrypt or scrypt."
