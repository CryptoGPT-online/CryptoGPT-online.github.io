    "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The code uses `random.ints()` to generate a password, which is not cryptographically secure. This makes the password predictable, allowing an attacker to easily compromise the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`, to generate the password."
