"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "String crypto = 'MD5'",
"description": "The code uses the MD5 hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collisions and can be easily attacked.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
