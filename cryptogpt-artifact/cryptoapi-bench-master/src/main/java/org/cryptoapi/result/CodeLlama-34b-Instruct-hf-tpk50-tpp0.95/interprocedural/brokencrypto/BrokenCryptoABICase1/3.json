"misuse": "Insecure Use of Crypto API",

"description": "The code uses the `Cipher.getInstance(crypto)` method to get an instance of the `Cipher` class, but does not specify the provider. This can lead to the use of insecure algorithms or providers, which can result in vulnerabilities such as CWE-256, 295, 297, 321, 326, 327, 338, 547, 650, 757, 759, and 760.",
"recommendation": "The code should specify the provider explicitly, either by using the `Cipher.getInstance(crypto, provider)` method or by setting the `java.security.properties` system property to specify the default provider."
