    "description": "Using ECB (Electronic Codebook) block cipher mode without proper countermeasures (e.g., authenticated encryption) can lead to predictable plaintext patterns and thus information leakage.",
    "recommendation": "Replace ECB with a more secure block cipher mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with appropriate padding."
