[{"misuse": "Weak Algorithm", 
  "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
  "description": "The code is using a low iteration count (11010) which may weaken the security of the key derivation process.",
  "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count (e.g., 100,000 or more) to make the key derivation process more secure."}]
