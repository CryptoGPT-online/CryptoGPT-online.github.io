  "description": "The getKey method retrieves the value of the system property 'pass.key', which may not be a secure source of cryptographic randomness. This can lead to insecure or predictable keys being used for encryption.",

  "description": "The algorithm 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding' is used for encryption without considering the appropriate mode of operation or IV (Initialization Vector), which can lead to cryptographic weaknesses.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure and appropriate mode of operation (e.g., GCM) with an unpredictable IV for AES encryption to mitigate potential cryptographic vulnerabilities."}]
