    "description": "The code generates a random salt using the SecureRandom class. However, the salt is only 32 bytes long, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the size of the salt to ensure sufficient randomness. For example, a salt length of 128 bits (16 bytes) is commonly used in cryptographic applications."

    "vulnerable_code": "count = 1050;",
    "description": "The code sets the number of iterations for the password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm to a static value of 1050. This may not provide sufficient encryption strength against brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a higher number of iterations to increase encryption strength. A commonly recommended number is at least 10,000 iterations, but the optimal value depends on the specific use case and performance requirements."
