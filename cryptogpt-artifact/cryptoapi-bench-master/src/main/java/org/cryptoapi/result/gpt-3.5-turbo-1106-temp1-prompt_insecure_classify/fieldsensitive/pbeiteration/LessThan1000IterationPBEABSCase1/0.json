    "description": "The method random.nextBytes(salt) is used to generate a salt value. However, the salt value is not long enough (only 32 bytes) to ensure sufficient randomness and uniqueness.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a longer random salt value, such as 128 bits (16 bytes), using a cryptographically secure random number generator."
