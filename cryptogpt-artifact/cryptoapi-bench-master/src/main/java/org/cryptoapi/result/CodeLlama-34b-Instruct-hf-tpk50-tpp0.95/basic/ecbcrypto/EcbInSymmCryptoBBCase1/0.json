"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm in ECB mode, which is vulnerable to attacks. ECB mode is deterministic and does not use an IV, which makes it easy for an attacker to deduce the encryption pattern and potentially decrypt the data. Additionally, PKCS5Padding is a weak padding scheme that can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM mode, and use a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS7 or RFC 5208. Additionally, use a randomly generated IV for each encryption operation."
