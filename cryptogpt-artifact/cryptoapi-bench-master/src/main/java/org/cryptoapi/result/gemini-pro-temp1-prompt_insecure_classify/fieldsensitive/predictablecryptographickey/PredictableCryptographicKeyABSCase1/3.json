    "description": "The key is truncated to 16 bytes, which is not secure for AES encryption. AES requires a key length of at least 128 bits (16 bytes) for adequate security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a key derivation function (KDF) to derive a key of the appropriate length from the password, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt. This will ensure that the key is sufficiently long and unpredictable."
