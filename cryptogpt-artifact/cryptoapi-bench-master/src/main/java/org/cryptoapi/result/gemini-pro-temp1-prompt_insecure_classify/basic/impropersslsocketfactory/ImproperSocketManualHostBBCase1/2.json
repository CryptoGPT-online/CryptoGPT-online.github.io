    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
    "description": "The code establishes an SSL socket connection with the default socket factory, which selects the strongest available encryption algorithms and protocols. However, using the default settings might not be secure enough in some cases. An attacker could leverage weak or outdated SSL/TLS implementations to downgrade the connection to a less secure configuration.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using the default SSLSocketFactory, consider creating a custom socket factory that explicitly specifies the desired security settings, such as the supported protocols and cipher suites. This approach allows you to enforce stricter security requirements and prevent potential downgrade attacks."
