    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used without a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). This can lead to predictable and weak keys.",
    "recommendation": "Use a CSPRNG that is appropriate for the application, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a more secure key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2."

    "description": "The password or key used to derive the encryption key is derived from a hard-coded value. This makes it easy for an attacker to guess the key and decrypt the data.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the password or key using a secure random number generator and store it in a secure location, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a key management system (KMS)."
