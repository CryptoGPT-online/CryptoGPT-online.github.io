 Here is the JSON response:
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyStore.getInstance(type)",
    "description": "The code uses the `KeyStore.getInstance()` method to create a new instance of `KeyStore` with a less secure algorithm. The `type` parameter is set to `JKS`, which is a less secure algorithm compared to other options like `PKCS12` or `BKS`.",
    "recommendation": "The code should use a more secure algorithm for creating the `KeyStore` instance. The `PKCS12` or `BKS` algorithms are recommended as they provide better security than `JKS`."
