    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is used to generate a salt value for cryptographic operations. However, the SecureRandom instance is not properly seeded with random values, which may result in a predictable or weak salt value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator like java.security.SecureRandom for generating salts. Additionally, ensure that the SecureRandom instance is properly seeded with unpredictable values for better randomness."
