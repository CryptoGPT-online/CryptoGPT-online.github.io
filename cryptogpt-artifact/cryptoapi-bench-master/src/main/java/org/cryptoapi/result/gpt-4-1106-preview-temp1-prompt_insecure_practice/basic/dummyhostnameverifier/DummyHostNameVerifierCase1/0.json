        "description": "This HostnameVerifier implementation bypasses all the hostname verification checks by always returning true. This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks as it accepts any SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server without validating whether the hostname matches the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Names (SANs).",
