  "description": "The usage of SecureRandom with a fixed seed obtained from Byte.parseByte(seed.toString()) is insecure and will result in a predictable random number sequence. Furthermore, the usage of parseByte method to obtain a seed from a character array is incorrect.", 
  "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom with a cryptographically secure seed obtained from a secure source such as SecureRandom.generateSeed method. Additionally, use proper data conversion and handling methods to convert the seed to byte array."}]
