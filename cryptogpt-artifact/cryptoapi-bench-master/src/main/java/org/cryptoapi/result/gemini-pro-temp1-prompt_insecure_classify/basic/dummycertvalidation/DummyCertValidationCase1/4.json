    "vulnerable_code": [
      "//Trust any client connecting (no certificate validation)",
      "//Trust any remote server (no certificate validation)"
    ],
    "description": "The code snippet disables all certificate validation for both client and server certificates. This means that any client or server with a valid certificate (or even an invalid certificate) will be trusted, which can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "recommendation": "Proper certificate validation should be implemented, such as checking the certificate's issuer, expiration date, and revocation status against a trusted certificate authority (CA). Additionally, the code should use specific algorithms for certificate validation, such as the X.509 standard."
