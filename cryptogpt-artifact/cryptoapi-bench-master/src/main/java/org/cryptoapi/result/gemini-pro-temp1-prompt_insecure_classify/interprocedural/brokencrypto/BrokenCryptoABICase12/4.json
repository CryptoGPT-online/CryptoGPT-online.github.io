    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "`method2(String c)` and `method1(String crypto)`",
    "description": "The code uses `KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto)` and `Cipher.getInstance(crypto)` to initialize the key generator and cipher respectively, where `crypto` is a user-supplied string. This allows an attacker to specify any cryptographic algorithm, including weak or broken ones, leading to insecure encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES, instead of relying on user input."
