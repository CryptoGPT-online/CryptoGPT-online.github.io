    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The code is using a static and hardcoded key with AES encryption. Additionally, the key is truncated to 16 bytes, which weakens the encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a strong and random key using a secure random number generator. Use a key derivation function like PBKDF2 or bcrypt to derive a key from a password if necessary."
