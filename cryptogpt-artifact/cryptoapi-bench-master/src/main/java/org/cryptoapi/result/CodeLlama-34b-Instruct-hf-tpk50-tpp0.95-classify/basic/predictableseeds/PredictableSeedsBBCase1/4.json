This code is vulnerable to the `CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values` misuse because the SecureRandom instance is seeded with a predictable value, which reduces the randomness of the output. The use of a predictable seed can make the random number generation predictable, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. To fix this misuse, the code should use a secure and random source of entropy to seed the SecureRandom instance.
