[{    "misuse": "Insecure Use of Cryptographic Hash Functions",    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",    "description": "The MD5 cryptographic hash function is no longer considered secure for many applications. It's been compromised, and there are valid use cases where it should not be used due to its susceptibility to collision attacks. An attacker could intentionally generate different inputs that hash to the same output.",    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead. Also, consider using a proper hashing library that helps mitigate all known vulnerabilities to hash functions."  }]
