    "description": "PBEKeySpec is initialized with a weak KDF. The PBEKeySpec constructor uses a weak KDF, which can be easily brute-forced. This makes it easy for attackers to recover the password and access the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF, such as PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 or bcrypt, to derive the key from the password. Also, increase the iteration count to at least 100,000 to make it more difficult for attackers to brute-force the password."
