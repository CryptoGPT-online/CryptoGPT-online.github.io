    "description": "The code is using a hard-coded key for encryption, which is insecure because anyone who knows the key can decrypt the ciphertext. A unique and unpredictable key should be generated for each encryption operation.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a unique key for each encryption operation. For example, you can use the `SecureRandom` class in Java."
