"description": "The SecureRandom class is intended to be used as a source of cryptographically secure random numbers. However, the setSeed method sets the seed of the SecureRandom object to the value of the provided byte array. This can potentially reduce the entropy of the generated random numbers, making them less secure. It is recommended to use the setSeed method with a cryptographically secure seed, rather than a user-provided byte array.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure seed, such as the output of a cryptographic hash function, to set the seed of the SecureRandom object."
