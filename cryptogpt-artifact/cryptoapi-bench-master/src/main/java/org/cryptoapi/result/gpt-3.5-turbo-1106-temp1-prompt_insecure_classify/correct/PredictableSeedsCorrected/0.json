[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "long l = sr.nextLong(); sr.setSeed(l);", "description": "The code uses the same value 'l' obtained from a single call to sr.nextLong() to seed the SecureRandom instance, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations.", "recommendation": "Use a more diverse source of entropy, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed(), to seed the SecureRandom instance for cryptographic operations."}]
