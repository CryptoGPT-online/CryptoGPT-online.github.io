    "vulnerable_code": `"DES"` in `KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");` and `Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");`,
    "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric block cipher that is considered insecure due to its short key length of 56 bits, which can be easily broken by modern computers. Using DES can compromise the security of your data.",
    "recommendation": "It is strongly recommended to use more secure and modern cryptographic algorithms, such as AES-256 or ChaCha20."
