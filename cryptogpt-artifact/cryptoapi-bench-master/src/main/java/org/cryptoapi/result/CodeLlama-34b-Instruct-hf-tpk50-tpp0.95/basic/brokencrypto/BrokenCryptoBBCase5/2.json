"description": "The encryption mode is set to ENCRYPT_MODE without any authentication. This can lead to tampering with the ciphertext, and can result in the attacker being able to modify the plaintext.",
"recommendation": "Use a mode that provides authentication, such as GCM or EAX, or provide a MAC separately."

"misuse": "Misuse of Key",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
"description": "The key is generated without any input, which means that the key is completely random. This can result in a weak key that is vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Provide a strong random seed for the key generation, or use a secure key derivation function to derive the key from a password or other input."
