 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers, but the `setSeed` method is used with a fixed array of bytes, which is not secure. This can lead to predictable output, which may be vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure source of entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getSeed`, to generate the seed for the `SecureRandom` object."
