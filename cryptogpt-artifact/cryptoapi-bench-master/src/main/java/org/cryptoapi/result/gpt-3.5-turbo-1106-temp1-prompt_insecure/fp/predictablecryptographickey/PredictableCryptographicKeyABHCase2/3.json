  "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");", 
  "description": "The key generation is insecure as it uses a key derived from a String using getBytes method, and then performs a fixed key length of 16 bytes by using Arrays.copyOf method. These practices can weaken the security of the AES encryption.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a secure random-based key generation method such as SecureRandom to generate the AES key with the required length."}]
