{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
"description": "The code uses the `AES` algorithm, which is a known broken algorithm and should not be used for any purpose. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding` instead.",
"recommendation": "Replace the `AES` algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding`."

"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
"description": "The code uses hardcoded credentials in the form of a byte array. This is a security risk as it allows an attacker to easily extract the credentials from the code.",
"recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials in the code. Instead, use a secure way to store and retrieve the credentials, such as a secure database or a secure storage service."

"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
"description": "The code uses a hardcoded byte array as the initialization vector (IV) for the cipher. This is a security risk as it allows an attacker to easily predict the IV and potentially decrypt the data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure way to generate the IV, such as using a secure random number generator."
