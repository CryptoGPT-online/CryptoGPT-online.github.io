"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
"description": "The use of AES in ECB mode is not secure, as it can result in the plaintext being recovered easily. ECB mode is also vulnerable to attacks that can result in the recovery of the encryption key. It is recommended to use a secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM mode, with a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS#7 or PSS.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM mode, with a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS#7 or PSS. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure random number generator to generate the Initialization Vector (IV) for the cipher."
