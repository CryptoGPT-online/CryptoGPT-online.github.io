"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is vulnerable to attack when the provided salt is small and the iteration count is high, as it can lead to a brute-force attack on the derived key.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random salt with at least 64 bits of entropy, and set the iteration count to a minimum of 1000. Additionally, use a secure Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) such as PBKDF2 or Argon2."
