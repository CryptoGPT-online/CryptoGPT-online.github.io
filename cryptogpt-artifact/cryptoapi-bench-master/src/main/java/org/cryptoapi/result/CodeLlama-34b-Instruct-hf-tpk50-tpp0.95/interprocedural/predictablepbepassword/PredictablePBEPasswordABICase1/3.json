"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.go(String password)",
"description": "The P1 class is using the outdated PBEKeySpec and PBEParameterSpec classes to derive a key from a password. These classes use a broken cryptographic algorithm (DES) which has been shown to be insecure. The iteration count is also too low, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES, and increase the iteration count to make it more secure. Also, use a larger key length to make the derived key more secure."
