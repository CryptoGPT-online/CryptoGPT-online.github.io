 {"misuses": [{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, kp.getPublic());", "description": "The encryption algorithm used is not secure. The 'RSA' algorithm is vulnerable to attacks, such as the commonly used 'RSA-PKCS1-v1_5' scheme, which can be broken by a determined attacker.", "recommendation": "Use a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, and a secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM, for encrypting sensitive data. Additionally, use a secure key exchange algorithm, such as Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Cryptography, to securely exchange keys between parties."}],
