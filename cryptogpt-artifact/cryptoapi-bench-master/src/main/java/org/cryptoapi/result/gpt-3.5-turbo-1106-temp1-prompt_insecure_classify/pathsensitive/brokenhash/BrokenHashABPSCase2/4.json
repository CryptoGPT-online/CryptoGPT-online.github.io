    "description": "The code is using SHA-256 algorithm only when the 'choice' variable is greater than 1. This implies that a less secure algorithm (MD5) might be used when 'choice' is less than or equal to 1.",
    "recommendation": "Always use a secure algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-512 and do not rely on runtime conditions for algorithm selection."
