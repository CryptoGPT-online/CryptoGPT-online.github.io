        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "String cryptoAlgo = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
        "description": "The code is using AES with ECB mode, which is not recommended as it does not provide serious message confidentiality. In ECB mode, identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to identical ciphertext blocks, making it susceptible to pattern attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM which provide better encryption schemes with an initialization vector to produce different ciphertexts even if the same plaintext block is encrypted multiple times."

        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
        "description": "The cryptographic key is generated without specifying a secure randomness source or a key size. This could potentially lead to the generation of weak keys that can be easier to break.",
        "recommendation": "Explicitly specify a key size for the AES key generator. For AES, a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits is recommended. Also, use SecureRandom to generate a strong source of randomness."
