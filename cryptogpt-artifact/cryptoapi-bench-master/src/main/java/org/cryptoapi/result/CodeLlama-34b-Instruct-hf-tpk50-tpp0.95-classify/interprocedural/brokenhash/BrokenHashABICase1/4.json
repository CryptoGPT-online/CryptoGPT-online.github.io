"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The method `getMessageDigestInstance(String algorithm)` takes the name of a cryptographic algorithm as an argument. The implementation of this method in the SunJCE provider is vulnerable to a misuse attack, where an attacker can supply a malicious algorithm that computes a collision with SHA-1. This can be used to compromise the security of the application. The recommended solution is to use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, and avoid using any algorithms that are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks."
