"vulnerable_code": "defaultKey.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")",
"description": "The `defaultKey` variable is generated using `SecureRandom`, but the generated key is not guaranteed to be of sufficient length. The `getBytes` method is then used to convert the `defaultKey` to a byte array, which may result in a truncated key if the generated key is longer than the maximum length of the `String` representation. This can lead to weakened encryption and potential vulnerabilities.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and well-defined key generation method, such as `KeyGenerator`, to generate a cryptographically secure key of sufficient length."
