  "description": "The setSeed method is being used to set the seed value for SecureRandom. This can introduce predictability and weaken the randomness of the generated values.", 
  "recommendation": "Instead of using setSeed method, it is recommended to directly initialize the SecureRandom instance with a strong seed using new SecureRandom(DEFAULT_SEED) or new SecureRandom(DEFAULT_SEED.clone()), where DEFAULT_SEED is a properly generated random byte array."}]
