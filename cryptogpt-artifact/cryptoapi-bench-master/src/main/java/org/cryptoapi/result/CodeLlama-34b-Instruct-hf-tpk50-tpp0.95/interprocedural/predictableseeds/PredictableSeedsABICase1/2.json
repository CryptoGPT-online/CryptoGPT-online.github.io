 Here is the JSON response:

{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
sr.setSeed(seed);",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is a cryptographic random number generator. However, using the setSeed method to set the seed can lead to a broken crypto algorithm. It is important to use a cryptographically secure random number generator for security-related purposes.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator for security-related purposes. Avoid using the setSeed method of the SecureRandom class."
