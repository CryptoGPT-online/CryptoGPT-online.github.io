    "description": "The code uses a weak KDF (Key Derivation Function) by creating a PBEParameterSpec object with a fixed iteration count. This can make it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong KDF, such as PBKDF2, with a high iteration count (e.g., 100,000 or more) to protect the password."
