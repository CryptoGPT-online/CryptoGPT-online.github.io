This could potentially lead to a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker can intercept and modify the communication between the server and the client.",
        "recommendation": "It is highly recommended to add proper validation or security checks in the checkServerTrusted() method. If you want to trust all servers, you can use a TrustManager that does not perform any checks at all."
