"description": "The code specifies a key size of 16 bytes, which is too small for a secure AES key. AES keys should be at least 256 bits (32 bytes) to be secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 256 bits (32 bytes) for AES encryption. Consider using a larger key size for additional security."
