"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "method2(crypto,key);",
"description": "The method method2 is using the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered to be broken and should not be used. The method is also using the ECB mode of operation, which is not semantically secure. Additionally, the key generation algorithm is not specified, which could result in the use of an insecure key.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure encryption algorithm such as AES, and specify a secure key generation algorithm such as RSA or DSA. Also, use a secure mode of operation such as GCM or CBC."
