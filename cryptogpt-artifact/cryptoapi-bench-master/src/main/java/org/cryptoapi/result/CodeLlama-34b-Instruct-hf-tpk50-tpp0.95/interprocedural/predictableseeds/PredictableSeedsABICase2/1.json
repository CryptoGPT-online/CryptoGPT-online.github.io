"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed})",
"description": "The SecureRandom constructor is not designed to be used with a single seed value. It is intended to be used with a byte array that has a length of at least 440 bits. Using a single seed value can lead to a predictable output, which can be exploited by an attacker to guess the next random number generated by the SecureRandom instance.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator that is designed for key generation, such as the KeyGenerator class. This class provides a cryptographically secure way of generating random keys."
