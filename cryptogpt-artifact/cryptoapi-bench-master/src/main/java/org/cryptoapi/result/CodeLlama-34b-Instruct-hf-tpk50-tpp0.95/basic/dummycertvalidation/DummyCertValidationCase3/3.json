"description": "The D3 class implements the X509TrustManager interface, but does not provide any meaningful implementation for the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods. This allows any certificate to be trusted, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Implement the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods to properly validate the certificate chain and reject any certificates that are not trusted."
