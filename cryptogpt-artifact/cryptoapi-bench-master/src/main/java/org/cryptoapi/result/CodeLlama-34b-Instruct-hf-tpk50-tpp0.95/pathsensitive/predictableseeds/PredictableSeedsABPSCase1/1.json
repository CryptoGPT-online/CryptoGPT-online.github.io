"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(bytes);",
"description": "The method `SecureRandom.nextBytes()` is used to generate a random byte array, but it is not used correctly in this code. The method generates a random byte array, but it is not used to seed the random number generator, which is what `SecureRandom.setSeed()` is for. Instead, the byte array is used to set the seed, which may not be secure.",
"recommendation": "Replace `sr.nextBytes(bytes)` with `sr.setSeed(bytes)` to fix the misuse."

{
"misuse": "Insufficient Entropy",
"vulnerable_code": "int choice=2;",
"description": "The variable `choice` is set to a fixed value, which means that the random number generated will always be the same. This is a form of insufficient entropy, as the random number is not truly random.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the value of `choice` to fix the misuse."
},
{
"misuse": "Lack of Input Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "if(choice>1)",
"description": "The input variable `choice` is used in the if statement without any validation or sanitization. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the value of `choice` to a value other than 2, which could cause unintended behavior in the code.",
"recommendation": "Validate and sanitize the input variable `choice` to fix the misuse."
