        "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random values, but the seed used is not cryptographically strong. The seed is derived from a map that is populated with hardcoded values, which can be guessed by an attacker. This can lead to predictable and exploitable values being used for random number generation.",
        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the seed. For example, `SecureRandom` can be used to generate random bytes, which can then be used as the seed."
