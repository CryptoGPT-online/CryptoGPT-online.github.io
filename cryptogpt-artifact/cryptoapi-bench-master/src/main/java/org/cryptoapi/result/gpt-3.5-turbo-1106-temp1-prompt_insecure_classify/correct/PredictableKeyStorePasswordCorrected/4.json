[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", "description": "The SecureRandom object is used to generate a password, however, the implementation does not guarantee the security of the generated password. Using random.ints() without specifying the bound may not provide sufficient randomness for generating a secure password.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating a random password, such as SecureRandom's nextBytes method with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG)."}]
