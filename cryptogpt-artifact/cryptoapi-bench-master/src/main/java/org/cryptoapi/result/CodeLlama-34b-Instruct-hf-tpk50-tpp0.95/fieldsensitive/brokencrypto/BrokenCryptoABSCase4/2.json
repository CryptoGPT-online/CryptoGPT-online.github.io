"vulnerable_code": "C5.encrypt() method using RC2 algorithm",
"description": "The C5.encrypt() method uses the RC2 algorithm, which is considered to be weak and insecure. RC2 has been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including brute force and known-plaintext attacks. Additionally, the key generation method used in the method is not secure, as it does not use a secure random number generator to generate the key material.",
"recommendation": "Replace the RC2 algorithm with a stronger and more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20. Additionally, use a secure random number generator to generate the key material for the encryption algorithm."
