 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "P2.java", "description": "The code uses the outdated and insecure password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm to derive a key from a password. The PBE algorithm was designed to be used with a slow hashing function, but in this case, it is not being used with a slow hashing function. This makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.", "recommendation": "Replace the PBE algorithm with a more modern and secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or Argon2."}
