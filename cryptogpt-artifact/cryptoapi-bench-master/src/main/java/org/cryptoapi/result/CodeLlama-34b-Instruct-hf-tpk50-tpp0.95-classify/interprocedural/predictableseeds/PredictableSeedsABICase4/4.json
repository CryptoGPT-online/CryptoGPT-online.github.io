{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "seed = SEED;",
"description": "The variable `seed` is assigned the value of `SEED`, which is a constant string with a low entropy. This can be used to generate a predictable seed, which can lead to a vulnerability in the random number generation.",
"recommendation": "Use a high-entropy source of randomness, such as `/dev/urandom` or `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate the seed for the `SecureRandom` instance."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())",
"description": "The method `Byte.parseByte(String)` is used to convert a string to a byte value, which can be used as a seed for the `SecureRandom` instance. However, the method only accepts a string of up to 3 characters, which can lead to a very small number of possible seeds, reducing the encryption strength.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger string for the seed, or use a different method to generate a secure random seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().nextBytes()`."
