"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\")",
"description": "The RSA algorithm with a key size of 1024 is considered to be broken and should not be used for encryption. A key size of 2048 is recommended for secure encryption. The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm can compromise the security of the encryption and make it vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "The code should be modified to use a secure cryptographic algorithm such as RSA with a key size of 2048 or higher."
