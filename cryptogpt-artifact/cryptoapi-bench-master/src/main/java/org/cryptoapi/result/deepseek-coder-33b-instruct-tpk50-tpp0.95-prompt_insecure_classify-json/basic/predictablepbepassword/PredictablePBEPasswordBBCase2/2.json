        "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;",
        "description": "The number of iterations in the password-based encryption is very high (11010 iterations). High iteration counts significantly slow down the hashing process, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks. It also eats up valuable computing resources, which can be exploited to launch denial of service attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Reduce the number of iterations. It is recommended to have at least 1000 iterations for SHA-256-based algorithms and at least 10,000 iterations for SHA-512-based algorithms. Consult the standards that govern the use of each algorithm to ensure compliance."
