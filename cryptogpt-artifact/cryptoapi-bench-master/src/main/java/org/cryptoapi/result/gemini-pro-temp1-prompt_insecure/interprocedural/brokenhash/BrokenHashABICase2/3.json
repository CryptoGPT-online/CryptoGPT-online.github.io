    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm for hashing, which is considered broken and no longer secure. Attackers can easily find collisions and preimages for MD5, making it unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
