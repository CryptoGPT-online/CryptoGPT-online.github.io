    "description": "The provided code defines a custom X509TrustManager (class D3) that doesn't perform any certificate validation. This means that any certificate will be accepted as trusted, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a custom X509TrustManager, it's recommended to use a well-known and trusted implementation, such as the default TrustManager provided by the Java runtime. Additionally, if a custom TrustManager is necessary, it should be carefully implemented to perform proper certificate validation."
