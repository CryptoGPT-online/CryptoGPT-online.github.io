        "description": "The code snippet uses the Random class from java.util, which generates predictable random numbers and is not cryptographically strong. Cryptographic operations rely on strong randomness to ensure the security of generated keys, nonces, and other elements. Using this insecure randomness source can lead to the generation of predictable values, which can be exploited by an attacker.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of java.util.Random with java.security.SecureRandom which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator."
