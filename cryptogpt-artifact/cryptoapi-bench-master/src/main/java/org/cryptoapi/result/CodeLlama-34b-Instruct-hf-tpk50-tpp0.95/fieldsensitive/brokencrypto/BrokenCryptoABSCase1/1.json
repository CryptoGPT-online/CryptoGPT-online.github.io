"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C2.encrypt()",
"description": "The C2 class uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered to be insecure and should not be used for encryption purposes. Additionally, the class uses the ECB mode of operation, which is not secure for encrypting arbitrary data. Instead, a secure encryption algorithm such as AES should be used, and the mode of operation should be set to CBC or GCM.",
"recommendation": "Replace the DES encryption algorithm with a secure algorithm such as AES, and use a secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM."
