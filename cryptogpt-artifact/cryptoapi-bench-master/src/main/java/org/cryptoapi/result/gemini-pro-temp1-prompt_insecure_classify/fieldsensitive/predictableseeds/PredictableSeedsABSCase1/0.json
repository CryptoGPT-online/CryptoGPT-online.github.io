    "description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom object is not sufficiently random. Using a constant or predictable value for the seed can make it easier for an attacker to predict the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the seed. For example, you can use the `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` method to obtain a CSPRNG."
