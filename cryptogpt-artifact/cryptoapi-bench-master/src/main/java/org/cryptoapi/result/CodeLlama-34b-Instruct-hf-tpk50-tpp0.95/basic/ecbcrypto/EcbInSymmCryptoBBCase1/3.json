"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "ECB mode is a known insecure mode of operation for AES. It does not provide any authenticity or integrity guarantees, making it vulnerable to tampering attacks. Additionally, PKCS5Padding is not secure for use with AES, as it does not provide any integrity guarantees. Instead, use a secure padding scheme such as PKCS7 padding or authenticated encryption modes such as GCM.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure padding scheme such as PKCS7 padding or authenticated encryption modes such as GCM. Avoid using ECB mode and instead use a mode that provides authenticity and integrity guarantees, such as CBC or GCM."}
