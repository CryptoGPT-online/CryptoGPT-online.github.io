        "description": "The SecureRandom class does not provide a cryptographically strong random number generator. The default constructor of SecureRandom uses a weak random number generator and it only uses the provided seed to generate its first value.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using the SecureRandom class with a small, user-provided seed, use a more secure random number generator or seed. For instance, you could use java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
