        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
        "description": "The method 'ints' of the class 'SecureRandom' generates a sequence of random integers, but the values are not used securely. In this case, the integers are converted to a string without proper validation, which makes it easier for attackers to guess the values.",
        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate random values, and properly validate the values to ensure they are securely used."
