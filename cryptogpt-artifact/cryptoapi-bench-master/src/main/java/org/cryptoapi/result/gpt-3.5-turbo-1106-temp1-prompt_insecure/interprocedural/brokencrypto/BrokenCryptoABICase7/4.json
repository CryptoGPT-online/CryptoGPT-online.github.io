  "description": "The KeyGenerator and Cipher instances are being created using a string value representing the algorithm, but the actual value is not defined in the code or initialized properly.",
  "recommendation": "Define and initialize the actual cryptographic algorithm to be used, such as AES or 3DES, rather than using an arbitrary string value."
