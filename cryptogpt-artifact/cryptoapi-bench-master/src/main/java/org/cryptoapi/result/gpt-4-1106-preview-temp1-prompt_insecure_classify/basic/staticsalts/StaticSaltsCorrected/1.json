  "description": "The iteration count of 1020 for PBEParameterSpec may be too low for modern security standards, potentially leading to inadequate encryption strength.",
  "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a value that is considered safe by current cryptographic standards, such as at least 10,000 iterations."
