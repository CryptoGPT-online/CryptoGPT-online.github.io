### False Positives Misuse:###
The misuse of the cryptographic algorithm MD2 is recognized as a false positive. The MD2 algorithm is known to be broken and has been used in insecure implementations. However, in this code snippet, there's no obvious manipulation of the input, so it might not constitute a real cryptographic misuse. However, MD2 usage is strongly discouraged, especially without a good reason.
