        "description": "While SecureRandom is used, which is good practice, it is not inherently a misuse. However, if the SecureRandom instance is not properly seeded, it may not provide sufficiently random values. This would be a potential issue if the SecureRandom instance is not using a strong seed source.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the SecureRandom instance is properly seeded with a strong seed source. In most cases, the default seeding should be sufficient, but this should be verified for the specific usage."
