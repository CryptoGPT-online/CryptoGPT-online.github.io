    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not properly initialized with a seed. As a result, the random values generated may not be cryptographically strong, which can lead to weakened security for cryptographic operations such as key generation or encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Initialize the SecureRandom instance using a strong source of entropy, such as by using SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() or by providing a seed from a secure random source."
