    "description": "The code is using a crypto algorithm (Blowfish) that is considered weak for security purposes. Blowfish has a block size of 64 bits and a key size of up to 448 bits. The keys in Blowfish can easily be brute forced, making it vulnerable to attacks if it were used for encryption of sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger crypto algorithm, such as AES (which provides a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits). Consider using a higher key size for encryption of sensitive data. Additionally, ensure the key is correctly managed and protected from unauthorized access."
