"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
"description": "The provided salt is a single byte with a low entropy value, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. It is recommended to use a larger and more random salt to increase the security of the cryptographic algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger and more random salt, such as a 16-byte or 32-byte value, and use a secure random number generator to generate the salt. This will make it more difficult for an attacker to guess the salt and compromise the cryptographic algorithm."
