    "description": "The code returns an empty array from `getAcceptedIssuers()`, which means that the trust manager will trust any certificate presented by the server. This is insecure because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a proper trust manager that validates certificates against a trusted certificate store."
