In CTR mode, each ciphertext block is XORed with the plaintext before encryption, so it doesn't reveal any information about the plaintext. In GCM mode, the authentication tag in the ciphertext will guarantee the authenticity and integrity of the ciphertext. This mode protects not only confidentiality but also authenticity and integrity of the data."
