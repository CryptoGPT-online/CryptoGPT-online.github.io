[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
 "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
 "description": "The code generates AES encryption keys with the default key size, which may be considered insufficient for secure encryption.",
 "recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 128 bits (e.g., AES-128) or stronger."},
{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
 "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
 "description": "The code uses a static byte array as the Initialization Vector (IV), which can lead to predictable IV values and weaken the security of the encryption.",
 "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation."}]
