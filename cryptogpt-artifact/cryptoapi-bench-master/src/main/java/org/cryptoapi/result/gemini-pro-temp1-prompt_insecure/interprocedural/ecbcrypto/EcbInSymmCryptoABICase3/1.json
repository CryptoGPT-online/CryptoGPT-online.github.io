    "description": "The code uses the default key size for AES, which is 128 bits. This is considered inadequate for modern cryptographic applications. An attacker could potentially brute-force a 128-bit key in a reasonable amount of time.",

    "description": "The code uses the \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\" cipher, which is known to be vulnerable to certain attacks. ECB mode does not provide confidentiality, and PKCS5Padding is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher, such as \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\"."
