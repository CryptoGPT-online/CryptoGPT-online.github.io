    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom constructor is initialized with a byte array containing a single byte, which is not sufficient to generate a cryptographically secure random number.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is initialized with a sufficient amount of entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a different seed generation strategy to ensure that the seed is unpredictable and unique."
