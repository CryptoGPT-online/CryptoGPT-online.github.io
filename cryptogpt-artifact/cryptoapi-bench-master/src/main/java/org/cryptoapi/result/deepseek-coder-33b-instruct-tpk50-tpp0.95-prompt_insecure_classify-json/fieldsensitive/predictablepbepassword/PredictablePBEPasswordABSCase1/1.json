        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator to create the salt value. For example, java.security.SecureRandom. Alternatively, you can use a Password Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) instead of PBEKeySpec, which can generate a secure salt value."

        "description": "The iteration count is set to 11010 and key length is set to 16, which are both insecure configurations for PBE encryption. This will allow for faster brute-force and dictionary attacks on the encrypted data.",
