    "description": "The code uses RSA encryption without specifying padding, relying on the default padding scheme. Historically, Java defaults to 'RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding' which is secure, but might differ across providers and versions. Unpadded RSA ('RSA/None/NoPadding') is insecure and should not be used.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure padding mechanism like OAEP when initializing the Cipher instance. For example, use 'RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding'."

    "description": "The code allows the use of a 1024-bit RSA key, which is considered weak and could potentially be broken with sufficient computational resources.",
    "recommendation": "Use key lengths of at least 2048 bits for RSA to ensure sufficient security against modern cryptographic attacks."
