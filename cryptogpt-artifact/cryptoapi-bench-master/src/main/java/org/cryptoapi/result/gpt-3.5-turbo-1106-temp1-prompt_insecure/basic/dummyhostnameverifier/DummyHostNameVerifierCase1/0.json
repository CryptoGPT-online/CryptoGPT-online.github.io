  "vulnerable_code": "public class D1 implements HostnameVerifier {\n    public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) {\n        return true;\n    }\n}",
  "description": "The code always returns true, which means it does not perform any hostname verification for SSL/TLS connections. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or server impersonation.",
  "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification logic in the verify method to ensure the hostname of the server matches the expected hostname. Consider using the default HostnameVerifier implementation provided by the Java platform or a custom implementation based on specific requirements."}]
