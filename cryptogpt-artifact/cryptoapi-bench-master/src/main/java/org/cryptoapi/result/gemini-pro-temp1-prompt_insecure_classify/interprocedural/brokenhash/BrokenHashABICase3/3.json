    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto) is used to create an instance of a MessageDigest algorithm using the specified algorithm name. The specified algorithm is MD4, which is a broken and insecure cryptographic algorithm. Using this algorithm can lead to attacks such as collision attacks, which can be used to find two messages that produce the same digest.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic hashing algorithm instead of MD4, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
