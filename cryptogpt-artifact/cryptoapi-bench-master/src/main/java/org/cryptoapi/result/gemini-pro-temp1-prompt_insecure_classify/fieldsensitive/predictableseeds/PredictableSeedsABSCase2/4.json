    "description": "The SecureRandom object is initialized with a single byte seed, which is not sufficient to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. This makes it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), or use a larger seed value."
