    "description": "The call to setSeed() may reduce the entropy of the random number generator if the seed is not random, possibly leading to predictable random numbers. By seeding SecureRandom with a static, known value, an attacker may be able to predict future outputs of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid setting a seed from a predictable source. It is usually not necessary to seed SecureRandom when using it for cryptographic purposes, as it is designed to be self-seeding from an entropy source on the platform."
