 {"misuses": [{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"IDEA\");",
"description": "The code uses the \"IDEA\" algorithm, which is a less secure algorithm compared to AES. This could be due to a misconfiguration or a lack of understanding of the security implications of the algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES with a sufficient key length and proper key management."},
{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "keyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
"description": "The code uses the \"AES\" algorithm with a default key length of 128 bits, which may not be sufficient for all use cases. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits for most applications.",
"recommendation": "Increase the key length to 256 bits or higher to ensure adequate encryption strength."},
{"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "int choice = 2;",
"description": "The code hardcodes the value of the \"choice\" variable, which could be used to store sensitive information such as encryption keys or credentials.",
"recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded value and use a more secure method for storing and managing sensitive information."}]}
