    "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
    "description": "The key is generated from a weak password `defaultkey` and is used without any salting or strengthening, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong password or passphrase and consider using a key derivation function (KDF) to derive a cryptographic key from the password, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt."
