[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", 
  "description": "The code generates a random password by converting the random integers to a string. However, this approach does not guarantee the creation of a strong password. Random integers may not have sufficient entropy to create a secure password.", 
  "recommendation": "Instead of converting random integers to a string, use a secure and reliable method to generate a random password with sufficient entropy, such as SecureRandom class."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;\nint keyLength = 16;", 
  "description": "The code uses a relatively low iteration count (11010) and a short key length (16). This can lead to inadequate encryption strength. Both the iteration count and key length should be set to values that match the recommended industry standards for the selected cryptographic algorithm.", 
  "recommendation": "Consult cryptographic guidelines or standards to determine the appropriate iteration count and key length for the chosen cryptographic algorithm."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", 
  "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);", 
  "description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec class, but the choice of the specific algorithm used internally is not specified. It is possible that a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is being used, which may compromise the security of the application.", 
  "recommendation": "Use PBEKeySpec with a secure and trusted cryptographic algorithm, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt."}]
