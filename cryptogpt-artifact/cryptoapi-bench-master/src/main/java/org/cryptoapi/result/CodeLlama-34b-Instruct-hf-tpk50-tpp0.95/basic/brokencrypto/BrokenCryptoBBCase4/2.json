"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
"description": "The code uses the RC2 encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for secure communication. RC2 is a weak block cipher that has been shown to be vulnerable to cryptanalysis.",
"recommendation": "Replace RC2 with a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES or Blowfish."
