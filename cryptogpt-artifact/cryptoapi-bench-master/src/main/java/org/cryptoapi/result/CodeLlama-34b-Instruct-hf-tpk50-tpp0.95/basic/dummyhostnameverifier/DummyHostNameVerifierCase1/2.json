"misuse": "Broken Hostname Verification",
"vulnerable_code": "return true;",
"description": "The verify() method always returns true, which means that any hostname will be accepted without any verification. This is a vulnerability because it allows an attacker to intercept and manipulate the communication between the client and the server.",
"recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verification mechanism, such as the built-in Java HostnameVerifier class, to verify the hostname of the server before establishing a secure connection."
