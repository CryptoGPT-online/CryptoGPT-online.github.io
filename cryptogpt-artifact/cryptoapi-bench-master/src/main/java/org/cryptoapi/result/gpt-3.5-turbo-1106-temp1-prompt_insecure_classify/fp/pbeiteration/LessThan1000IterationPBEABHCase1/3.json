    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class should be used to generate random values for security purposes. However, in this code snippet, the random.nextBytes() method is used to generate salt for password-based encryption, but the salt generation is not properly randomized, which may lead to weak encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) such as SecureRandom to generate a strong and unpredictable salt for password-based encryption. Example: byte[] salt = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().generateSeed(32);"
