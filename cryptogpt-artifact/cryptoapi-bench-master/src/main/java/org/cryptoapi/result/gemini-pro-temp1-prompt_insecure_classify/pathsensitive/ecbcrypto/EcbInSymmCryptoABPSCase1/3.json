    "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses ECB (Electronic Codebook) block cipher mode, which is considered insecure due to its lack of data confidentiality. It is recommended to use a more secure block cipher mode like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) instead.",
    "recommendation": "Change the block cipher mode to a more secure one. For example, use \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" instead of \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\"."
