        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
        "description": "The use of a fixed array of bytes as a seed for a SecureRandom instance is not secure. It allows an attacker to predict the random values generated by the SecureRandom instance.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), to generate a random seed. Also, consider using a sufficient seed length, at least 128 bits, to make it harder for an attacker to predict the random values."
