    "description": "The code initializes 'SecureRandom' with a static seed which can make the random number predictable. This defeats the purpose of using 'SecureRandom' which is designed to produce non-predictable random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that seeds are not static and are generated in a secure manner to provide high entropy for the random number generator."
