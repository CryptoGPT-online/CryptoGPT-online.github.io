    "description": "The code uses a static char[] crypto to determine the cryptographic algorithm name. However, the value of crypto is not properly set and can be changed by other methods at runtime. This can lead to the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using static and mutable char[] to determine cryptographic algorithm names. Instead, use a constant string variable that is set to a specific algorithm name."
