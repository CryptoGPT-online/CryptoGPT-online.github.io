 "description": "The AES algorithm is used with the default key size, which is considered to be inadequate for strong encryption. The default key size for AES is 128 bits. Using a smaller key size can make the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks.", 
 "recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 256 bits for AES encryption to ensure stronger security."},

 "description": "The PKCS5Padding is used, which is considered to be insecure. It is recommended to use PKCS7Padding instead.", 
 "recommendation": "Change the padding scheme to PKCS7Padding for improved security."},
