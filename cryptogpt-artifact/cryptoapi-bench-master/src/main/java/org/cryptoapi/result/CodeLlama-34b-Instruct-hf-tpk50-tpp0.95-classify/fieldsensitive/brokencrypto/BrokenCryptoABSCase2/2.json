"description": "The code uses the Blowfish algorithm, which is considered weak and vulnerable to attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, to encrypt data.",
"recommendation": "Replace the Blowfish algorithm with a more secure algorithm, such as AES, in the code and update the key generation and encryption functions accordingly."
