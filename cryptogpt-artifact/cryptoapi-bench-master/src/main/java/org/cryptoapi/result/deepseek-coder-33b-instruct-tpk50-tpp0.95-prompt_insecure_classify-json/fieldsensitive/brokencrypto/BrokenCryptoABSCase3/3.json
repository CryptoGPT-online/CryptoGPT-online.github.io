    "description": "The code is using the RC4 encryption algorithm which is considered insecure and is also known to be susceptible to attacks like padding oracle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Do not use RC4 or any other insecure encryption algorithm. Instead, use an encryption algorithm that is secure and recommended by the cryptography community, such as AES. Also, ensure the cipher instance is always set to a secure algorithm, rather than using the default algorithm."

    "recommendation": "When generating keys, ensure they are of sufficient length for the chosen algorithm. Also, consider using secure random number generators to generate keys."
