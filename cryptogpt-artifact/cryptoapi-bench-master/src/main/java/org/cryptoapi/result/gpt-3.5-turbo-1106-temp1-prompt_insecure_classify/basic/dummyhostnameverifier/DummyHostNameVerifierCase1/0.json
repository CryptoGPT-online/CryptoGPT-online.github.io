  "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
  "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String s, SSLSession sslSession) { return true; }",
  "description": "The implementation of the 'verify' method in the 'D1' class accepts any hostname without performing any validation. This can lead to insecure connections as the server's certificate is not properly validated to ensure the correct hostname is being accessed.",
  "recommendation": "Properly validate the server's certificate during SSL/TLS connections. Implement proper hostname verification using the 'verify' method."
