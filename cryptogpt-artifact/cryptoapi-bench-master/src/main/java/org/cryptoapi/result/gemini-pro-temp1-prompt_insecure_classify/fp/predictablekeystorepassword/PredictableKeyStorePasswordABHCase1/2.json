Sure, here is the JSON report of the crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = password.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");",
    "description": "Key is generated based on the system time. This is not a cryptographically secure way to generate a key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a key. For example, `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."
  }
]
```

The code generates a key for the keystore using `SecureRandom.ints()`, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. This means that the generated key is predictable and could potentially be guessed by an attacker. This is a violation of CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.

To fix this issue, the code should use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the key. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
