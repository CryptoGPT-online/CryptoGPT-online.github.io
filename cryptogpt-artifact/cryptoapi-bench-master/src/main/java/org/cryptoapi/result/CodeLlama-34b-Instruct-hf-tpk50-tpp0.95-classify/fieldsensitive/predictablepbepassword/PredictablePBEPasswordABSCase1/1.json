 {"misuses":[{"misuse":"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm","vulnerable_code":"password","description":"The password is hardcoded and can be easily obtained by an attacker.","recommendation":"Use a secure password generation algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to generate a salted hash of the password. Store the salt and hash in a secure location, such as a password vault, and never hardcode them."},{"misuse":"CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials","vulnerable_code":"sagar","description":"The username and password are hardcoded and can be easily obtained by an attacker.","recommendation":"Do not hardcode credentials. Store them in a secure location, such as a password vault, and never use them in plaintext."},{"misuse":"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values","vulnerable_code":"new byte[16]","description":"The salt value is not securely generated. It can be easily predicted by an attacker.","recommendation":"Use a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate the salt. Store the salt in a secure location, such as a password vault, and never hardcode it."},{"misuse":"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength","vulnerable_code":"int keyLength = 16","description":"The key length is too short and can be easily brute-forced by an attacker.","recommendation":"Use a larger key length, such as 256 or 512, to make the encryption more secure."}]}
