  "description": "The code uses a hardcoded initialization vector (IV) which poses a security risk as it does not provide uniqueness or randomness, potentially leading to cryptographic vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Generate a secure, random IV for each encryption operation using a secure random number generator (RNG), such as SecureRandom class."}]
