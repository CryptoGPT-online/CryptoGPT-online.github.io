        "description": "The encryption strength is determined by the `count` parameter, which is derived from the `DEFAULT_COUNT` constant. This constant has a value of 20, which is considered inadequate for modern encryption standards.",
        "recommendation": "Use a larger value for the `count` parameter, such as 1000 or more, to increase the encryption strength."

        "description": "The `PBEParameterSpec` class is used to generate pseudorandom numbers for the encryption key. However, the `PBEParameterSpec` class is considered less secure than other methods, such as the `SecureRandom` class.",
        "recommendation": "Use the `SecureRandom` class instead of the `PBEParameterSpec` class to generate pseudorandom numbers for the encryption key."
