        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used (RC4) is considered broken or insecure. It provides a weak level of encryption and should not be used for any serious or sensitive data. Weak algorithms such as RC4 can be easily broken using modern computing resources.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use strong, modern cryptographic algorithms for encryption. For example, you could use AES with a 256-bit key size. AES is the current most secure encryption algorithm and has been accepted by the U.S. government."
