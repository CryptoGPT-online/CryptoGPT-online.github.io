    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate a random salt. However, the default implementation of `SecureRandom` uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. A PRNG is a deterministic algorithm that can be predicted if the seed is known. This means that an attacker could potentially guess the salt and compromise the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the salt. CSPRNGs are designed to be unpredictable and resistant to guessing attacks. Some common CSPRNGs include `java.security.SecureRandom` with a suitable provider (e.g., `new SecureRandom(new CryptoProvider())`) or `java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."
