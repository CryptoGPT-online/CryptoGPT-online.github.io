 {
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")",
"description": "The code is using AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding as the cipher algorithm, which is a less secure algorithm than the recommended AES/GCM/NoPadding. Using a less secure algorithm can leave the data vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Replace the AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm with AES/GCM/NoPadding for better security."
