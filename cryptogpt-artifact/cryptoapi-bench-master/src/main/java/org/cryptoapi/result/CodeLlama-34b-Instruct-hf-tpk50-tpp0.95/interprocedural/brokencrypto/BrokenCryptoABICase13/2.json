        "description": "The use of the RC4 algorithm is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including the Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir (FMS) attack, which can recover the secret key and decrypt the data. This is because RC4 is a stream cipher that uses a 64-bit random key, and the FMS attack can recover the key by exploiting the serial correlation in the cipher stream.",
