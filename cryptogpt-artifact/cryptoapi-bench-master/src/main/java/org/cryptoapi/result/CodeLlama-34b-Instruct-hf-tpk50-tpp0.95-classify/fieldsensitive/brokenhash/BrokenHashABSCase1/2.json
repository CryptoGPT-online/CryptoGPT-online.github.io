"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C1 crypto;  crypto = new C1(\"SHA1\");",
"description": "The SHA-1 hash algorithm is vulnerable to collisions and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. Instead, a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 should be used.",
"recommendation": "Replace the SHA-1 algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."

"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "String passedAlgo;  if(passedAlgo.isEmpty()){passedAlgo = crypto;}",
"description": "The 'crypto' variable is initialized with a hardcoded value, which makes it vulnerable to a fixed-iv attack. The passedAlgo variable is also initialized with a hardcoded value, which makes it vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack. To prevent these attacks, the cryptographic algorithm should be initialized with a randomly generated value.",
"recommendation": "Initialize the 'crypto' and 'passedAlgo' variables with randomly generated values using a secure random number generator."
