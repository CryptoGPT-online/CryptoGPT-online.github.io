    "description": "Blowfish is considered a weak encryption algorithm due to its small block size. The use of Blowfish presents a risk of weak encryption strength.",

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish\")",
    "description": "By not specifying the encryption mode and padding, the Cipher will default to ECB mode which is insecure for encrypting multiple blocks of data due to pattern preservation.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a secure mode of operation like CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM and provide an appropriate padding mechanism, e.g., 'Cipher.getInstance(\"Blowfish/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")'. Also, manage initialization vectors (IVs) appropriately when using modes other than ECB."

    "description": "The KeyGenerator does not explicitly specify a secure random source which might lead to weak keys if a weak random source is used.",
    "recommendation": "Explicitly specify a secure random source by using 'keyGen.init(keysize, secureRandom)' where 'secureRandom' is an instance of 'SecureRandom' initialized with a high entropy source."
