        "description": "DES is considered a weak algorithm due to its small key size of 56 bits, which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."

        "description": "The DES algorithm, coupled with ECB mode, does not provide strong encryption strength. ECB mode is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols because it does not provide serious message confidentiality.",
        "recommendation": "Switch to AES encryption and use a more secure mode of operation like CBC, GCM, or CTR."
