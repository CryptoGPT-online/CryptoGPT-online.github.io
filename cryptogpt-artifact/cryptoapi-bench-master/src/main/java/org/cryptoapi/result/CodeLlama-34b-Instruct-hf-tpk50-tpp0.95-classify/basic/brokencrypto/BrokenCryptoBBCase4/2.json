"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"RC2\");",
"description": "The code uses the RC2 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Change the algorithm to a more secure one, such as AES."
