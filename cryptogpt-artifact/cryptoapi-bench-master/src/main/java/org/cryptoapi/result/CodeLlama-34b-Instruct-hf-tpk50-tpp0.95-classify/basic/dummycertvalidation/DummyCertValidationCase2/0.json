        "description": "The code implements the X509TrustManager interface, which is used to handle X.509 certificates. However, the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are empty, which means that any certificate will be trusted without any validation.",
        "recommendation": "The code should be updated to validate the certificates properly. The checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods should be implemented to check the validity of the certificates and to verify the trust chain."
