[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\")", 
  "description": "The code is using AES algorithm in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with PKCS5 padding. However, CBC mode does not provide secure encryption without an initialization vector (IV), and PKCS5 padding can introduce padding oracle vulnerabilities.", 
  "recommendation": "Use an authenticated encryption mode like AES-GCM or AES-CCM that provides both confidentiality and integrity of the ciphertext. Generate a random IV for each encryption operation."}]
