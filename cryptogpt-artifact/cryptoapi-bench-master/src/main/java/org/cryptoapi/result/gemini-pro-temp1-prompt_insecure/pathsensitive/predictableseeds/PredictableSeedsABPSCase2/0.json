    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` with an insecure seed. The seed used is a byte array containing only two bytes, which is not sufficient for creating a secure random number generator. An attacker could easily guess the seed and predict the random numbers generated by `sr`.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed for `SecureRandom`. This can be achieved by using `SecureRandom#getInstanceStrong()` or by providing a secure seed explicitly to the `SecureRandom` constructor."
