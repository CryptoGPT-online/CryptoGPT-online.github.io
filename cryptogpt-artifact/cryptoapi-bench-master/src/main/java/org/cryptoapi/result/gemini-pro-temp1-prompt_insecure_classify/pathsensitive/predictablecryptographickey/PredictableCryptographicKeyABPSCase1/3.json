    "description": "The code is using a SecureRandom to generate a key for the AES algorithm. However, the SecureRandom is being used to generate a string of ints, which is then converted to a byte array. This is not a secure way to generate a key, as the resulting key will not be cryptographically strong.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a SecureRandom to generate a string of ints, the code should use the SecureRandom to generate a byte array directly. This will ensure that the resulting key is cryptographically strong."
