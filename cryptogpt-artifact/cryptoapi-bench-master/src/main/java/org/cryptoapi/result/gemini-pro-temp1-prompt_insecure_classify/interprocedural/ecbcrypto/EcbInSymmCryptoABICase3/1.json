CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength. (e.g. Low key/salt length or iteration number, static password/salt...)

* Vulnerable code:
```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);
```

* Description:
The code uses ECB mode, which is known to be insecure. It is recommended to use a more secure mode such as CBC or GCM.

* Recommendation:
Change the cipher to use a more secure mode, such as CBC or GCM.
