"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm with ECB mode and PKCS5Padding, which is vulnerable to attacks such as block replay and padding oracle attack. It is recommended to use a more secure mode such as GCM or CBC, and to use a secure padding scheme such as OAEP or PKCS7.",
"recommendation": "Replace the line `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");` with `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");` and remove the line `cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);`. Also, make sure to use a secure random number generator to generate the key, and to use a secure key management system to store and retrieve the key."
