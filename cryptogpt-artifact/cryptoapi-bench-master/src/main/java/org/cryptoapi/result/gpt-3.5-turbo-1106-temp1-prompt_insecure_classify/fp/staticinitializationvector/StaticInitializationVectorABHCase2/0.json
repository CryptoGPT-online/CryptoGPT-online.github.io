    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = str.getBytes();",
    "description": "The method 'getBytes()' without any parameter uses the platform's default charset which might not be a suitable charset for representing the password as bytes. It can lead to inconsistencies when running the code on different platforms or machines. In addition, using the user's provided input directly as a password can expose the system to potential attacks such as injection or manipulation of the password.",
    "recommendation": "Use a charset such as UTF-8 to get the bytes of the input string. Additionally, consider using a stronger key derivation function to generate a secure key from the password such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt."
