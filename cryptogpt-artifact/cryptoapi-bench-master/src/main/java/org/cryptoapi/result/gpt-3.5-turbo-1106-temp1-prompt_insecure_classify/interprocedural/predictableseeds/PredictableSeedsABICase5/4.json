    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The code is using an insecurely generated seed for the SecureRandom object. The seed is set using a byte array that only consists of two predetermined bytes.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a static seed, use a stronger and more random source of entropy to initialize the SecureRandom object. For example, you can use SecureRandom.generateSeed() to generate a random seed."
