[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")\nCipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")", "description": "The code is using AES as the cryptographic algorithm. Although AES is generally considered secure, it is important to review the key size and encryption mode to ensure they meet current security standards.", "recommendation": "Ensure that a strong key size (128 bits or higher) and a secure encryption mode (such as AES/GCM) are used."}]
