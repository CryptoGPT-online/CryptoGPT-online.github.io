 {"misuse": "Weak Random Number Generation", "vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom();\n        sr.setSeed(seed);", "description": "The code uses a weak random number generation algorithm, which can be vulnerable to prediction attacks. The SecureRandom class is designed to be a cryptographically secure random number generator, but the seed used in this code is too small and not truly random, making it vulnerable to attacks.","recommendation": "Use a stronger random number generator, such as the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) SecureRandom class, and ensure that the seed used is truly random and of sufficient length."}
