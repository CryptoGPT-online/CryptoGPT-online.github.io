### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The use of a Low Entropy IV (CWE-330)
The IV in the given example is a static string, not randomly generated, which is an indicator of insecure behavior. However, the static string is very short and not considered a good practice. Thus, this misuse needs to be updated accordingly.
