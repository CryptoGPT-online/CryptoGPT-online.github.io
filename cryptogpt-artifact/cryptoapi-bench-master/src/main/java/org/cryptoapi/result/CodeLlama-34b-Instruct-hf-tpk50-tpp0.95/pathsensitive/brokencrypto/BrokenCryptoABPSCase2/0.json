[
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Blowfish",
"description": "The use of Blowfish as a crypto algorithm is not recommended due to its weakness and known vulnerabilities.",
"recommendation": "Replace Blowfish with a more secure and up-to-date crypto algorithm, such as AES."
},
{
"misuse": "Insufficient Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "key = keyGen.generateKey();",
"description": "The key size used for AES encryption is not specified, which means that a default key size of 128 bits is used. This is not considered secure enough for modern cryptographic standards.",
"recommendation": "Always specify the desired key size when generating keys for crypto operations, and use a key size of at least 256 bits for maximum security."
},
{
"misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
"description": "The `KeyGenerator` class uses a pseudorandom number generator to generate the key, which may not be secure enough for cryptographic purposes. This can be mitigated by using a secure random number generator, such as the `SecureRandom` class in Java.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the key, or use a pre-shared key that is known to be secure."
