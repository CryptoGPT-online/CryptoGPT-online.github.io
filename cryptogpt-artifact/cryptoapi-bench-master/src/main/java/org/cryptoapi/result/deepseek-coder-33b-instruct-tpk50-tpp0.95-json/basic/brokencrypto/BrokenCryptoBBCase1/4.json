[{  "misuse": "Weak Encryption Algorithm",  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"DES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",  "description": "The DES encryption algorithm is considered to be weak due to its small key size of only 56 bits. It is easy to brute-force the key using modern-day computers. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or similar algorithms with a key size of 128 bits are recommended.",  "recommendation": "Use AES for encryption instead of DES. Replace the \"DES\" string in the KeyGenerator.getInstance() method with \"AES\". Also, change \"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\" to \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" or \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\". For mode of operation, you can consider using CBC or GCM modes."}]
