    "description": "The code uses the value of the 'crypto' variable to specify the cryptographic algorithm for the KeyGenerator and Cipher instances. However, the 'crypto' variable is never initialized or set to a secure cryptographic algorithm. Using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm can lead to vulnerabilities, such as weak encryption or decryption.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or RSA, instead of using the 'crypto' variable or the 'DEFAULT_CRYPTO' value."

    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded value of 'IDEA' as the default cryptographic algorithm. Hardcoding credentials or sensitive information can expose them to unauthorized access or misuse.",
    "recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials or sensitive information. Instead, consider using secure configuration management practices to store and retrieve sensitive information."
