"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto)",
"description": "The method MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto) is used with the String variable 'crypto', which is not a trusted source of information. An attacker could potentially manipulate this value to use a different algorithm that is not secure, leading to vulnerabilities in the cryptographic operations.",
"recommendation": "Use a hardcoded string for the algorithm name, or validate the user input before passing it to the method."
