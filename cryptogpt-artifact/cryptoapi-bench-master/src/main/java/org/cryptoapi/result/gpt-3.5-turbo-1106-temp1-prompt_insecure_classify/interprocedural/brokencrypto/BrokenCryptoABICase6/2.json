    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
    "description": "The code uses the value of the 'crypto' variable to determine the algorithm for key generation. The 'crypto' variable is a char[] array and it is not clear where the value comes from or how it is set. This can result in the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the 'crypto' variable is set to a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or RSA."
