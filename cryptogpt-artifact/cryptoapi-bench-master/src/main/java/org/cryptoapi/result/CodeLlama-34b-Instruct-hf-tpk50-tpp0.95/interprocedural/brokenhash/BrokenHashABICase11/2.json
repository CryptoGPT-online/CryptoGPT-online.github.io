"description": "The MD4 algorithm is a broken hash function that is not suitable for cryptographic use. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and should not be used for any security purposes.",
"recommendation": "Replace the MD4 algorithm with a more secure and modern hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
