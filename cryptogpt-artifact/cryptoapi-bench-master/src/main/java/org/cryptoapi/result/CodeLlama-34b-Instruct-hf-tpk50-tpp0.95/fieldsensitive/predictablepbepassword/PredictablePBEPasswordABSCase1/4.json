"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "method1(String passedPassword)",
"description": "The method uses PBEKeySpec with a fixed iteration count of 11010, which is low and can be brute-forced easily.",
"recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 100000, and make sure to increase the count as hardware power increases."
},
{
"misuse": "Insecure Password Storage",
"vulnerable_code": "defPassword = password",
"description": "The method stores the password in plain text, which is a security risk as the password can be accessed by unauthorized parties.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure password storage method, such as hashed and salted password, and never store the password in plain text."
},
{
"misuse": "Lack of Input Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "if(passedPassword.isEmpty())",
"description": "The method does not validate the input password, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.",
"recommendation": "Always validate the input password, and ensure that it meets the necessary requirements, such as length and complexity."
},
{
"misuse": "Lack of Nonce",
"vulnerable_code": "salt = new byte[16];",
"description": "The method does not use a nonce, which can lead to replay attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a nonce, which is a number that is incremented after each use, to prevent replay attacks."
