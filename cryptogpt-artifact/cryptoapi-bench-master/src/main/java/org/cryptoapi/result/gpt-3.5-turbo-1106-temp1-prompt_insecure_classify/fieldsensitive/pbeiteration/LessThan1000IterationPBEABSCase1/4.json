    "description": "The salt length of 32 bytes is considered too short for modern encryption algorithms. Secure salts should typically be at least 128 bits (16 bytes) in length.",

    "description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is being used with a single integer value as the iteration count. This usage does not provide sufficient control over the key derivation process and may use a weak or insecure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2, that allows for specification of the iteration count and other parameters."
