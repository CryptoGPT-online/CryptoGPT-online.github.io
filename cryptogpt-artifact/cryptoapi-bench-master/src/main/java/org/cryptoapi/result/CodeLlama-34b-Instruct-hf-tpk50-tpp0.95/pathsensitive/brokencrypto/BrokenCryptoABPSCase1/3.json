"description": "The code uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used. The recommended replacement is AES.",

{
"misuse": "Insufficient Key Size",
"vulnerable_code": "SecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
"description": "The code uses the KeyGenerator.generateKey() method to generate a secret key without specifying the size of the key. This can result in a key that is too small, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use the KeyGenerator.getInstance() method to specify the size of the key, and ensure that it is at least 128 bits for AES encryption."
}

{
"misuse": "Mismatched Mode and Padding",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
"description": "The code uses the Cipher.getInstance() method to specify both the encryption mode and the padding scheme, but the mode and padding scheme do not match. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as missing or duplicated padding.",
"recommendation": "Ensure that the encryption mode and padding scheme used in the Cipher.getInstance() method call match the requirements of the AES encryption algorithm."
}

{
"misuse": "Missing IV",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
"description": "The code uses the Cipher.init() method to initialize the cipher for encryption without specifying the IV (initialization vector), which is required for CBC mode encryption.",
"recommendation": "Ensure that the IV is specified in the Cipher.init() method call when using CBC mode encryption."
