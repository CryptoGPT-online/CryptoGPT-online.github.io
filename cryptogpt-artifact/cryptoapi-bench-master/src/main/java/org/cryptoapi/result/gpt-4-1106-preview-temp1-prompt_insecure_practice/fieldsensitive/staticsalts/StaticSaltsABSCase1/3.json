    "description": "The salt for Password-Based Encryption (PBE) should be at least 64 bits (8 bytes) to ensure security, and each instance should use a unique salt. Using a single-byte, hard-coded salt significantly lowers the security and increases the risk of cracking the encryption through rainbow tables or other means.",
    "recommendation": "Use a securely-generated, random salt of at least 8 bytes and ensure that it is unique for each encryption operation. For secure random salt generation, consider using SecureRandom."

    "description": "A low iteration count for PBE reduces the time required for an attacker to perform brute force attacks. The iteration count (also known as the work factor) should be set as high as possible, based on system performance, to increase security.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as at least 10,000, to make brute force attacks more difficult and time-consuming. Adjust the number according to performance tests and security requirements."
