{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "method1(null)",
"description": "The method 'method1' uses a null byte array as the salt for the password-based encryption algorithm. This can lead to a weak encryption and make the password more vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a strong and unique salt for each password encryption."

"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "defSalt = salt",
"description": "The class 'C1' uses a fixed salt value for all instances. This can make the encryption predictable and easier to crack.",
"recommendation": "Use a unique and random salt value for each instance."
