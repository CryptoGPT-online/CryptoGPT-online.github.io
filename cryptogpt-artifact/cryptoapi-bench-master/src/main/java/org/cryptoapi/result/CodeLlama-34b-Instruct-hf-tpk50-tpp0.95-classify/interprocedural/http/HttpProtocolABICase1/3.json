        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "new URL(url)",
        "description": "The use of the `URL` constructor with the `url` parameter can lead to a weak cryptographic algorithm being used for URL canonicalization, which can result in vulnerabilities such as DNS rebinding or open redirect attacks. The `URL` constructor should only be used with trusted URLs.",
        "recommendation": "Use a safer and more secure method for handling URLs, such as the `URI` class or a third-party URL manipulation library."
