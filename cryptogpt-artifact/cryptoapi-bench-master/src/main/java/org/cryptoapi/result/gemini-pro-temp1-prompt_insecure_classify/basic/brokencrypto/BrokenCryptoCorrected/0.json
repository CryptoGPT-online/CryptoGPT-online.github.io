    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses the CBC mode with PKCS5 padding for AES encryption, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext by sending carefully crafted ciphertexts to the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as GCM or CCM, which are resistant to padding oracle attacks."
