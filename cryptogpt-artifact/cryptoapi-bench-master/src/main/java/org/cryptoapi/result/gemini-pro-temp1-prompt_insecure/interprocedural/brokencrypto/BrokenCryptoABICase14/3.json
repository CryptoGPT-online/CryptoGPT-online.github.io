    "description": "The code uses the RC2 algorithm, which is a weak cryptographic algorithm and is no longer considered secure. RC2 is susceptible to various attacks, including brute-force attacks, and should not be used for any cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20."
