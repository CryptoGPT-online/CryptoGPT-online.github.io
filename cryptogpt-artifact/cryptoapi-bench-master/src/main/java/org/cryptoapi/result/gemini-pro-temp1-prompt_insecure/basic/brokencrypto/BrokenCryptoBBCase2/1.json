    "description": "Using Blowfish for encryption is considered insecure due to its relatively weak key size and susceptibility to brute-force attacks. It's recommended to use a more secure algorithm like AES with a sufficient key length (e.g., AES-256).",
    "recommendation": "Replace the usage of Blowfish with a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES."
