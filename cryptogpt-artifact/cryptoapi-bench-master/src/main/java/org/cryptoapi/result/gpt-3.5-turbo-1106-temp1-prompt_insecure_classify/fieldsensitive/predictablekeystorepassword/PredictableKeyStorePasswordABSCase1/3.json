    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "ks.load(cacerts.openStream(), passedKey.toCharArray());",
    "description": "The `load` method of `KeyStore` is used to load the keystore from the specified input stream. In this code, the keystore is loaded using a password passed as a `char` array. This is a potential misuse because using a `char` array to represent a password can lead to security vulnerabilities. `char` arrays can be explicitly zeroed out from memory after use, while `String` objects cannot. Therefore, using a `String` object to represent a password is more secure.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of passing the password as a `char` array, use a `String` object to represent the password."
