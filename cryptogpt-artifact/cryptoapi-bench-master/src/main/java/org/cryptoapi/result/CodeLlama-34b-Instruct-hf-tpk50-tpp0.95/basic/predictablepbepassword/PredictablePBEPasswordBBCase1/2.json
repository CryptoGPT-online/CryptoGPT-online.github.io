 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
"description": "The use of a static string as a default password is insecure because it can be easily discovered by an attacker. The use of a fixed iteration count is also insecure because it allows an attacker to perform a dictionary attack on the password. Additionally, the use of a fixed key length is insecure because it limits the strength of the encryption.

"recommendation": "Use a secure password generation mechanism, such as Openwall's dieharder, to generate a random and secure password. Use a secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2, to derive the encryption key from the password. Use a variable iteration count and a variable key length to increase the strength of the encryption."}
