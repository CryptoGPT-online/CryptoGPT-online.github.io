    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses MD5 for hashing, which is considered cryptographically weak and insecure. MD5 is susceptible to collision attacks, making it unsuitable for applications that require strong security.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
