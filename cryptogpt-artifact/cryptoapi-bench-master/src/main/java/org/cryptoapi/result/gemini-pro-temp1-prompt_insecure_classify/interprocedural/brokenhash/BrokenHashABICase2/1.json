    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses MD5, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm and is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
