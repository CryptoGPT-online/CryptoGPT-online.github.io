[{"misuse":"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values","vulnerable_code":"SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());","description":"The use of random.ints() may not provide a sufficiently random value for generating a cryptographic key. This can weaken the encryption strength.","recommendation":"Use a more reliable method to generate a random key, such as SecureRandom.nextBytes()."}]
