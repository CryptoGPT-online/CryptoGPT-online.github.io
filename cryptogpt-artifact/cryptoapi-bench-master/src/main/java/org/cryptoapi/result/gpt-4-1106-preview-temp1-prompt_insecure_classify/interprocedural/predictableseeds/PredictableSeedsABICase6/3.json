        "recommendation": "Remove the seed parameter from the SecureRandom constructor to allow it to self-seed with entropy from the underlying operating system. Alternatively, use a more secure source of entropy for the seed value."

        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
        "description": "Using a single byte as a seed for SecureRandom does not provide enough entropy (only 8 bits) and can lead to weak cryptographic operations due to the low entropy of the seed.",
        "recommendation": "Use a larger and more secure source of entropy for seeding SecureRandom. Ideally, allow SecureRandom to self-seed or obtain a seed from a strong source of randomness."
