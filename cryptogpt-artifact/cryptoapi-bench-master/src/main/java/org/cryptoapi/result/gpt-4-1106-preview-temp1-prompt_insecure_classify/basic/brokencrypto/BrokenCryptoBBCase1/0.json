        "description": "DES provides inadequate encryption strength due to its 56-bit key size, and ECB mode does not provide serious message confidentiality as identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks.",
        "recommendation": "Switch to AES with a secure mode of operation like CBC or GCM, and ensure that you use a key size of at least 128 bits."
