"description": "The use of the DES algorithm in ECB mode is vulnerable to attacks such as the ECB padding oracle attack. This can allow an attacker to recover the plaintext of the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm such as AES in GCM or CBC mode with a secure key management system to protect the encryption key."
