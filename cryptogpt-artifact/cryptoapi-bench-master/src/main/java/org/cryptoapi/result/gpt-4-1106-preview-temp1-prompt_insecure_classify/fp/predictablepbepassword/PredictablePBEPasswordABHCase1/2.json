        "description": "The key length specified for the encryption is 16 bits, which is inadequate for secure encryption and provides very weak security.",

        "description": "The default key is generated using a random integer sequence converted to a string, which might not provide sufficient randomness and entropy for cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper cryptographic key generation approach that ensures high entropy and randomness suitable for secure encryption."
