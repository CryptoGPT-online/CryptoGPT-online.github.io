    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate random bytes for the salt value, but the length of the salt is fixed at 16 bytes. This may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the length of the salt to at least 32 bytes to provide stronger randomness."
