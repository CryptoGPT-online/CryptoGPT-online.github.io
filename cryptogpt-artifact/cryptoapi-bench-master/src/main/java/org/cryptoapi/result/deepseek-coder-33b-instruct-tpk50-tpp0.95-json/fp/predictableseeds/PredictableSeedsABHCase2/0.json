    "description": "The provided seed array [b,b] for SecureRandom's setSeed method has only two elements, which may not be sufficient for secure random generation. If the same seed value is used multiple times, it may lead to predictable random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "To ensure secure random generation, a seed value with sufficient entropy should be used. It's recommended to use an array of at least 20 bytes for seeding. For instance, the output of a strong cryptographic hash function like SHA-1 or an established algorithm like Fortuna can be used."
