[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The SecureRandom instance is not explicitly initialized with a secure seed, and the salt generation does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator like SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() to initialize SecureRandom, and ensure that the salt used for cryptographic operations is generated using a secure random number generator."}]
