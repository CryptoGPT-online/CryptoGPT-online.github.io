"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C1 class",
"description": "The C1 class uses a hardcoded URL for cryptographic operations, which can be vulnerable to attacks that exploit the trust relationship between the application and the hardcoded URL. The use of a hardcoded URL also makes it difficult to update the cryptographic operations in the future.",
"recommendation": "Replace the hardcoded URL with a user-supplied or dynamically generated URL that can be easily updated and verified."
