    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed byte array as the seed for the SecureRandom object. Using a fixed seed reduces the randomness and makes it easier for an attacker to guess the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random seed using a secure source of randomness, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
