    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses the default AES algorithm, which is considered insecure for modern cryptographic purposes. AES should be used with a secure key length and in conjunction with a strong cipher mode and padding scheme.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES-256 with a strong cipher mode like GCM or CBC with a secure padding scheme such as PKCS#7."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inappropriate Encryption of Data: Initialization Vector (IV) Handling Errors",
    "vulnerable_code": "passedIV = defIV;",
    "description": "The code sets the passedIV variable to the default IV, which is a constant value. This means that the same IV is used for all encryptions, which makes the ciphertext predictable and vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for each encryption operation and securely transmit it to the recipient along with the ciphertext."
