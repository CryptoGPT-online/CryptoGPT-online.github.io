"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())})",
"description": "The provided code is using the SecureRandom class to generate random numbers, but the seed used is based on a hardcoded string which is predictable and can be easily guessed by an attacker. This can lead to a predictable output of random numbers, which defeats the purpose of using cryptography for security.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and unpredictable seed for the SecureRandom class, such as a truly random seed generated by a secure random number generator."
