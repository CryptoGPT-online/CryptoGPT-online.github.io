  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
  "description": "The salt array used in the PBEParameterSpec is initialized with random bytes using SecureRandom. However, the number of bytes used for the salt is fixed at 32. While it is generally recommended to use a random salt of a certain length, using a fixed number of bytes could potentially make the salt weak or insecure.",
  "recommendation": "Consider using a salt length that is securely recommended, or allow the length to be a parameter that can be adjusted based on the security needs of your application."
