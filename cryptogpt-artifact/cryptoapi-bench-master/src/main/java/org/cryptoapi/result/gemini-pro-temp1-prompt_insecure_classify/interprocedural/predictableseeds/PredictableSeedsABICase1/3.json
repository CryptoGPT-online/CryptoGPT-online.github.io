    "description": "The seed for the SecureRandom object is generated using a hardcoded value, which makes it predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator to generate the seed for the SecureRandom object. For example, the SecureRandom class provides a method called `generateSeed()` that can be used to generate a cryptographically strong random seed."
