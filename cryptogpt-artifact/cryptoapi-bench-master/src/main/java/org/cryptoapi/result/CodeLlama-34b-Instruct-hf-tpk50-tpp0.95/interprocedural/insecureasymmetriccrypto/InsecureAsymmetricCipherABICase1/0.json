It has been shown to be vulnerable to attacks such as frequency analysis and deduced plaintext. The code should use a more secure algorithm, such as elliptic curve cryptography, instead.",

"recommendation": "Use a secure key generation algorithm, such as SHA-256, and specify the required security parameters, such as a key size of at least 256 bits."
