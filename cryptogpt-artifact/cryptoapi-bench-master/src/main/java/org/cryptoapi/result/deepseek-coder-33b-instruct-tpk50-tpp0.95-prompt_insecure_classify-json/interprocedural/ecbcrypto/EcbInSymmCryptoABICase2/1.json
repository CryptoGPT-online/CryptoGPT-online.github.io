        "description": "In this case, the cryptographic algorithm used is defined in a static field. If a user can control this field, they can potentially choose a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, which may make the code susceptible to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to define the cryptographic algorithm within the method where it is being used instead of a static field. Alternatively, consider validating and sanitizing the user's input to ensure only trusted and supported cryptographic algorithms are used."

        "description": "The KeyGenerator is being used to generate an AES key, which is then used to encrypt data. While the specific issue may vary depending on the algorithm used, in general, insecure random values could lead to insecure cryptographic operations, especially if the values are not random enough.",
        "recommendation": "In order to guarantee secure random values, always use cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) or cryptographic secure random functions (CSRFs) for key generation. In Java, the class java.security.SecureRandom provides a CSPRNG."

While the specific issue may vary depending on the algorithm used, in general, using weak or inadequate encryption strength could lead to the encryption keys being easily cracked, and sensitive data being compromised.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a sufficient and strong cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-256, with a secure and well-distributed key. Remember, the security of the encrypted data also depends on the strength of the key, which should be managed securely."
