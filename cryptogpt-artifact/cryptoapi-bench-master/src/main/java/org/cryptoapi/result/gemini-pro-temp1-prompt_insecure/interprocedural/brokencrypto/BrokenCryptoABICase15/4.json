    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "`method1` and `method2`",
    "description": "The code uses the `IDEA` algorithm for encryption, which is considered insecure due to its weak key size and susceptibility to brute-force attacks. Using a weak encryption algorithm like `IDEA` can compromise the confidentiality of encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the `IDEA` algorithm with a more secure one, such as `AES` with a key size of at least 128 bits, to ensure adequate encryption strength."
