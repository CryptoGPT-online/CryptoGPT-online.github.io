    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;\nSecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The code uses a constant value `100` as the seed for the `SecureRandom` instance. This makes the generated random numbers predictable, which can be exploited by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and avoid using constant or predictable values as seeds."
