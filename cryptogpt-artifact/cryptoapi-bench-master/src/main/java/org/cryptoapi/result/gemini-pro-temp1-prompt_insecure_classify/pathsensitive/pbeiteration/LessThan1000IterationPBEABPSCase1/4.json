    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used without a seed, which may result in predictable random values. This can weaken the security of the encryption algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator, such as `SecureRandom` with a seed, to generate the salt and other random values."

    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\npbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);",
    "description": "The `PBEParameterSpec` is being used with a low iteration count (`count`) of 1050, which may not be sufficient to protect against brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value, such as 100,000 or more, to make the encryption more resistant to brute-force attacks."
