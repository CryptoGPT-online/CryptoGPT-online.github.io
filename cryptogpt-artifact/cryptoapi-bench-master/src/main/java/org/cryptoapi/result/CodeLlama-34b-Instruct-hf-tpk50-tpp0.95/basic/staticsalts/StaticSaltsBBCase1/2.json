"description": "The random salt used for password-based encryption is hardcoded, making it predictable and allowing an attacker to potentially guess the password.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generation function, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`, to generate the salt. Additionally, consider using a higher iteration count to increase the computational complexity of the password hashing algorithm."
