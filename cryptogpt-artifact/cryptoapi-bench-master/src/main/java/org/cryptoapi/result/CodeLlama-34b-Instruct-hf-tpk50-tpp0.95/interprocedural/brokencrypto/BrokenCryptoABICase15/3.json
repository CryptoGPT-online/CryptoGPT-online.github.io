"description": "The provided code uses the IDEA encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for any security purposes. It is recommended to use more secure encryption algorithms, such as AES, to protect sensitive data.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of the IDEA algorithm with a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, and retest the code to ensure that it is functioning correctly."
