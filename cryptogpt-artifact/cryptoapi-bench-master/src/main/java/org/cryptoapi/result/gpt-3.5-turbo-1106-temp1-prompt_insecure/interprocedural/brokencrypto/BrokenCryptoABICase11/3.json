  "misuse": "Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(cryptoKey);",
  "description": "The KeyGenerator.getInstance() method is called with the 'cryptoKey' parameter, which should represent the algorithm name, but in this case, it's used as the algorithm's key size. This can lead to insecure key generation.",
  "recommendation": "Use appropriate method and algorithm to generate the key size based on the cryptographic algorithm."
