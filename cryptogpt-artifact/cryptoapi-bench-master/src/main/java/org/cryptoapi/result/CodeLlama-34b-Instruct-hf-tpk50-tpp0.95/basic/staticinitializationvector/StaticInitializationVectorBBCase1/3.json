"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\")",
"description": "The code is using the AES algorithm, which is a broken encryption algorithm. It has been shown to be vulnerable to a number of attacks, including the Flush-and-Pulse attack.",
"recommendation": "It is recommended to use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."

"misuse": "Insufficient Entropy",
"vulnerable_code": "ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes)",
"description": "The code is using a fixed initialization vector (IV) for the encryption, which can lead to a vulnerability known as the IV re-use vulnerability. This can allow an attacker to potentially decrypt the ciphertext.",
"recommendation": "It is recommended to use a randomly generated IV for each encryption operation."
},
{
"misuse": "Lack of Key Management",
"vulnerable_code": "key = keyGen.generateKey()",
"description": "The code is using a generated key for encryption, but it is not properly managed. This can lead to a vulnerability known as the key misuse vulnerability, where an attacker can potentially use the same key for multiple encryption operations.",
"recommendation": "It is recommended to properly manage the encryption key, such as using a key management system or a secure key storage solution."
