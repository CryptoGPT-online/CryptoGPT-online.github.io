{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
 "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
 "description": "The code is using ECB mode for AES encryption which is insecure due to its lack of proper encryption chaining and vulnerability to certain attacks.",
 "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM."}
