[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);", "description": "The use of SecureRandom to generate random bytes is generally good practice, but in this case, the generated random salt is stored in an array with a fixed size of 32 bytes. This can potentially lead to insufficient randomness if the generated salt is truncated due to the fixed size of the array.", "recommendation": "Ensure that the salt array is large enough to accommodate the full output of SecureRandom, or consider using a different approach to store the generated salt."}]
