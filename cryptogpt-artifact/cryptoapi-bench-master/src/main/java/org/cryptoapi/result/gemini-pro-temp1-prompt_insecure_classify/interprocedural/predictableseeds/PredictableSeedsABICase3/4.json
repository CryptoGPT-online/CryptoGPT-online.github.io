    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "seed = SEED;",
    "description": "The value of the `seed` variable is directly assigned to the `SEED` variable, which is a static final variable that is initialized with a fixed value. This means that the `seed` variable will always have the same value, which makes it predictable and insecure for use in generating random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a new random seed using a secure random number generator and use that to initialize the `seed` variable. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG").generateSeed(16)` to generate a 16-byte seed."
