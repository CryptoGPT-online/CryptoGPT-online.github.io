    "description": "The code is using the Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode of operation in AES. ECB mode is not secure and should not be used due to the possibility of pattern analysis if the encrypted data has predictable patterns. In ECB mode, the same input will always produce the same output.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a different mode of operation in AES such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). CBC will add an extra security by XORing each block of data with the ciphertext of the previous block. GCM is an authenticated mode which includes an integrity check."
