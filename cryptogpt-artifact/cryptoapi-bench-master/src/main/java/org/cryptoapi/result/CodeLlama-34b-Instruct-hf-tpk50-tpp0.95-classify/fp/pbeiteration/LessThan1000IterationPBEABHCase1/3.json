"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "int iteration = hm.get(\"bbb\");\n\n    SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\n    PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\n    byte[] salt = new byte[32];\n    random.nextBytes(salt);\n    //int count = 20;\n    pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, iteration);",
"description": "The iteration count used in the PBEParameterSpec is too low. The recommended minimum value is 1000, but a higher value is recommended to improve security.",
"recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to at least 1000, or better yet, use a higher value such as 10000 or more. Additionally, consider using a more secure algorithm such as Argon2 or scrypt."
