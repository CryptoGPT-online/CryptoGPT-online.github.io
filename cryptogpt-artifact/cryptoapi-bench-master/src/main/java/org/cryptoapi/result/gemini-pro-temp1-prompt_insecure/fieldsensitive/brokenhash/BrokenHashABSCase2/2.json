    "description": "The code uses MD5, which is considered a broken and risky hashing algorithm. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
