    "vulnerable_code": "String url = \"http://gmail.com\"",
    "description": "The URL \"http://gmail.com\" is hardcoded in the code. This is a security risk because it means that anyone who can read the source code can see the URL and potentially use it to access the website or service that it points to.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded URL and instead use a configuration file or environment variable to store the URL. This will make it more difficult for attackers to find and exploit the URL."
