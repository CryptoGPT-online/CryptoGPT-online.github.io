    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses DES encryption algorithm, which is considered weak and insecure by today's standards. DES has a key size of only 56 bits, which is easily brute-forced using modern computing power.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the usage of DES with a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."

    "vulnerable_code": "if (choice > 1)\n            cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code allows the choice of encryption algorithm based on the value of the 'choice' variable. If 'choice' is greater than 1, it uses AES with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding. However, it is not clear how the value of 'choice' is determined or validated, leaving the possibility that a weak or insecure algorithm could be chosen.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the value of 'choice' is properly validated and restricted to only allow strong and secure encryption algorithms, such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits and a secure mode of operation like CBC or GCM."
