    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The code uses a SecureRandom instance with a seed derived from the `seed` array, which is mutable and potentially insecure. This practice makes the SecureRandom instance predictable and vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of generating the seed from a mutable array, consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that generates a truly random seed. Java provides the `java.security.SecureRandom` class for this purpose, which can be initialized with a cryptographically secure seed."
