"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyStore.getInstance(type);",
"description": "The code uses the `KeyStore.getInstance(type)` method to get an instance of the KeyStore class. However, this method returns a KeyStore instance that uses the default algorithm, which may not be secure. The `type` parameter is not verified, and an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to load a custom KeyStore implementation that is insecure.",
"recommendation": "To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `type` parameter is properly verified and sanitized. Additionally, you should use a secure algorithm for loading the KeyStore instance, such as `KeyStore.getInstance(type, "BC")`, where `BC` is the Bouncy Castle provider."
