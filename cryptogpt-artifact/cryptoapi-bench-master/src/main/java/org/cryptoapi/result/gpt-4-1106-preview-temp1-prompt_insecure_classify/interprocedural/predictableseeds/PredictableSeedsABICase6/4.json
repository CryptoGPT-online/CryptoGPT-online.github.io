        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
        "description": "The SecureRandom instance is seeded with a single, hardcoded byte value which does not provide enough entropy for secure randomness.",
        "recommendation": "Do not manually seed the SecureRandom unless absolutely necessary; allow it to self-seed with sufficient entropy. If seeding is required for predictability in tests, use a separate mechanism for test code, and ensure that the seed is sufficiently complex and not hardcoded in production code."
