"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
"description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers, but the seed used is a static and predictable value, which can be exploited to predict the output of the random number generator.",
"recommendation": "Use a truly random seed, such as the output of a hardware random number generator, or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator."
