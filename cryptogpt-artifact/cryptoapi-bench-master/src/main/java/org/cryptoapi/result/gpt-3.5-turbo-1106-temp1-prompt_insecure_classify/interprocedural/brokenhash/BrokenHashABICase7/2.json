    "vulnerable_code": "CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();",
    "description": "The use of hardcoded credentials is considered a security vulnerability as it allows attackers to easily guess or manipulate the credentials. In this code, the DEFAULT_CRYPTO value is hardcoded as 'MD4' and is assigned to the CRYPTO array.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using hardcoded credentials, consider using a secure credential storage such as a keystore or external configuration file to store the cryptographic algorithm information."

    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The getInstance method in the MessageDigest class is used to obtain a MessageDigest object that implements the specified cryptographic algorithm. In this code, the algorithm is obtained from the 'crypto' array, which is derived from the 'CRYPTO' array that contains the hardcoded algorithm name. The use of 'MD4' as the algorithm is considered less secure compared to newer and stronger algorithms such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a hardcoded algorithm, consider using a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. These algorithms provide stronger security and are less prone to cryptographic weaknesses."
