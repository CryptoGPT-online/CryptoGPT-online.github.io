"description": "The developer has used the `equals()` method to compare hostnames, which is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. The `equals()` method checks whether the two strings have the same characters in the same order, which is not secure when dealing with hostnames. The attacker can cause DNS rebinding by pointing the hostname to a different IP address, and then the `equals()` method will return `true` even though the actual hostname is different.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure method to compare hostnames, such as the `publicSuffixMatch()` method provided by the `javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier` interface."
