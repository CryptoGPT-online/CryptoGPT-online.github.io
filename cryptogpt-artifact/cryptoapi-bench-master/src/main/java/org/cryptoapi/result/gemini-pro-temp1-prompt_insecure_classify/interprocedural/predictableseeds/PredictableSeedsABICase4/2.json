    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The code uses a single byte as a seed for the SecureRandom instance, which is not sufficiently random. This can lead to predictable random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), which uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate random numbers."
