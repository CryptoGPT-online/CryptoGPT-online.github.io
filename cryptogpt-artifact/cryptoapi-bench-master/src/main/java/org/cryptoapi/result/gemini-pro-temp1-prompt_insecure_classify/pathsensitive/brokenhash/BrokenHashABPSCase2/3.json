    "description": "MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that has been shown to be insecure and is no longer considered a safe algorithm to use. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the use of MD5 with a more secure cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
