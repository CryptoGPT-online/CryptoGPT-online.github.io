"description": "The URL constructor is vulnerable to malicious input, as it does not validate the input URL. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the construction of a malformed URL, which can be exploited by attackers.",
"recommendation": "Use a safer URL parsing library, such as the URL class in the Apache Commons Lang library, which provides better validation and handling of malicious input."
