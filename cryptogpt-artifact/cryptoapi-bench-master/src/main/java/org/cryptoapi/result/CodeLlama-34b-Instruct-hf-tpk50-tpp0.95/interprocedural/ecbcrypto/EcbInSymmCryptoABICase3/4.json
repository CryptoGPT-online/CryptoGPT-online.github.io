"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm in ECB mode with PKCS5 padding, which is vulnerable to attacks such as Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 padding oracle attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure padding scheme such as OAEP or GCM, and consider using a secure mode of operation such as GCM or EAX."
