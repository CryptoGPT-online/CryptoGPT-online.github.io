"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
"description": "The IV is derived from a hardcoded string, which is not random and can be easily guessed. This makes the encryption predictable and vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the IV, such as SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\") or Random.SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")."
