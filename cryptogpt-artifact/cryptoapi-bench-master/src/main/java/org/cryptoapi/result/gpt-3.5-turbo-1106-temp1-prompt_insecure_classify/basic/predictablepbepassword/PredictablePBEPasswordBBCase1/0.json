[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(defaultKey.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
  "description": "The key length of 16 and iteration count of 11010 may not provide sufficient encryption strength for PBEKeySpec.",
  "recommendation": "Increase the key length and iteration count to improve encryption strength, or consider using a more secure algorithm such as AES with a secure key length and mode of operation."}]
