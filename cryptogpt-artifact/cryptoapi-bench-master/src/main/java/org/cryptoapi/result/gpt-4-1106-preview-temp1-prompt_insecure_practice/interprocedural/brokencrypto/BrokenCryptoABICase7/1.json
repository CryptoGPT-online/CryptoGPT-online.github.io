        "description": "The transformation in Cipher.getInstance() is derived from a character array, which could lead to unspecified or default transformation modes (ECB, CBC, etc.) if the array is not initialized correctly or manipulated. Moreover, the code directly converts the array to a String without specifying the transformation details like padding or operation mode, which might default to insecure ones.",
        "recommendation": "Always specify the encryption mode and padding scheme explicitly in the transformation string (e.g., AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding). Avoid using ECB mode due to its vulnerabilities, and use CBC or GCM modes with proper IVs."
