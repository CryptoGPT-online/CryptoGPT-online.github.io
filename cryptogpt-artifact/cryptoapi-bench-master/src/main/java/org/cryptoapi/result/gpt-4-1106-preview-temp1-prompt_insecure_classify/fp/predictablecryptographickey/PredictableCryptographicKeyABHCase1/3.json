    "description": "The code generates a key using SecureRandom but does not use it properly. It converts the random numbers to a String which might not use the full entropy of the generated numbers and then gets the bytes from the string, reducing the security of the key.",

    "description": "This code snippet potentially shortens the key to 16 bytes without ensuring that the initial key material was of sufficient length or randomness, which may result in a weak key that does not meet the minimum security requirements for strong encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the key material is of adequate length and randomness for the required level of security."
