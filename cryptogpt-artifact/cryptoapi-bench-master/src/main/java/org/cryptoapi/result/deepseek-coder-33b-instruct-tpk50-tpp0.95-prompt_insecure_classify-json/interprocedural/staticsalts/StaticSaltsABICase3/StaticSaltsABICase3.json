### False Positive Misuse ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2}; int count = 1020;",
        "description": "The salt length is only one byte, and the iteration count is a very high number which may increase the risk of brute-force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using longer salts and adjusting the iteration count according to the strength needed for your specific situation. A good starting point is 10,000 iterations for PBE."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};\nint count = 1020;",
        "description": "The salt value and count are insufficiently random and may be too low. They may not provide enough entropy for secure encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a random salt of sufficient length and a high iteration count for secure encryption."

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "method2(salt,count)",
        "description": "The salt has only one byte and the iteration count is 1020, which are both insecure and less than the recommended values.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a random salt of at least 64 bits (8 bytes) length and use a larger iteration count. For example, use a value like 2^20. This will increase the time and resources required to break the encryption."
