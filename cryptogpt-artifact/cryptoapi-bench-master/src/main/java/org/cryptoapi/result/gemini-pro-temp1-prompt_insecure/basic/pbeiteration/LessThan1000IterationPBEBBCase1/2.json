    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 20;",
    "description": "The encryption key is generated with an iteration count of 20, which is insufficient for modern security standards. This makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the key and decrypt the data.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a more secure value, such as 100,000 or more."
