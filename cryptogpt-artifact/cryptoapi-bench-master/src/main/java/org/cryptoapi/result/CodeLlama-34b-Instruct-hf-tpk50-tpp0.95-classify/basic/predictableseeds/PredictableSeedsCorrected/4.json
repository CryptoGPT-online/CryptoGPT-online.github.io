    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l)",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is used with a predictable seed value, which can be easily guessed by an attacker, making it easier to predict the random values generated by the SecureRandom class.",
    "recommendation": "Use a non-deterministic method to generate the seed value, such as using a random number generated by a trusted source, or using a secure random number generator that is not predictable."
