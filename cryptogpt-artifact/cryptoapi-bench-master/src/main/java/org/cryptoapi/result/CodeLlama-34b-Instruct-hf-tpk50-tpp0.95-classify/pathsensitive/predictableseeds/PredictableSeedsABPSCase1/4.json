"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes)",
"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is designed to be used as a secure source of randomness, but it can be misused if the seed is not properly generated. In this case, the seed is set to a static array of bytes, which can be easily guessed. This can lead to predictable random numbers and potentially insecure cryptographic operations.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`"
