    "vulnerable_code": "ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);",
    "description": "The initialization vector (IV) used in the cipher is generated using the \"abcde\" string, which is not a random value and can be easily guessed. Using a fixed IV can make it easier for an attacker to break the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for each encryption operation, and store it alongside the encrypted data. This will ensure that each encryption operation uses a unique IV, making it harder for an attacker to break the encryption."

```
Note that the `ivSpec` variable is generated using the fixed `bytes` array, which is not a random value. This is a security vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to break the encryption.
