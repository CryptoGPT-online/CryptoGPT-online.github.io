    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] seed = {b,b};",
    "description": "The code uses a static seed to initialize the SecureRandom instance, which makes the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is seeded with a truly random source, such as `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows."
