    "description": "The code uses a fixed size of 32 bytes for the salt, which may not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic operations.",
    "recommendation": "Generate the salt with a sufficient number of random bytes based on the requirements of the cryptographic algorithm. For example, use a salt length of at least 128 bits (16 bytes) for modern cryptographic algorithms."
