    "description": "The code sets a fixed seed for the SecureRandom instance that potentially reduces the randomness of the output, making it more predictable if an attacker knows the seed. SecureRandom should not be seeded with predictable data, especially if security depends on the randomness of the values produced.",
    "recommendation": "Do not manually set the seed for SecureRandom unless it is essential for the application. Let the implementation use its entropy source to seed itself."
