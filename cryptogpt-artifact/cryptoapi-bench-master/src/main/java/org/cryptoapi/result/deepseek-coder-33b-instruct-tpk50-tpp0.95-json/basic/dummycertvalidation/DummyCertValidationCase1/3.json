        "description": "This code is allowing any client to connect without validating the client's certificate. This can potentially expose the client to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this, you should ensure that the client's certificate is validated by implementing a proper certificate validation algorithm. For instance, you could use the javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager to validate the client's certificate against a list of trusted certificates."
