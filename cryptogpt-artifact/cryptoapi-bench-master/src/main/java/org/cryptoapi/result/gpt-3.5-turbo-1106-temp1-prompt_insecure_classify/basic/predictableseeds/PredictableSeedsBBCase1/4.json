    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "The setSeed method is used to initialize the random number generator with a seed value. In this code, a fixed byte array is used as the seed, which does not provide sufficient randomness. This can lead to predictable or easily guessable random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a fixed byte array as the seed, use a more secure and unpredictable source of randomness, such as SecureRandom's default constructor or generateSeed method."
