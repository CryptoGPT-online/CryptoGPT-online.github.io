 {
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
"description": "The salt used for PBE key derivation is not properly generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator. It is vulnerable to attacks that use precomputed tables of commonly used salts.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the salt, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() or the randomBytes() method of the SecureRandom class."
