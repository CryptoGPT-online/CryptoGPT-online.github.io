"description": "The provided code is vulnerable to a broken cryptographic algorithm, as the AES algorithm used in the code is not secure and can be easily broken using a known-plaintext attack.",
"recommendation": "Replace the AES algorithm with a secure and industry-standard algorithm, such as AES-256, and use a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS7 padding."
