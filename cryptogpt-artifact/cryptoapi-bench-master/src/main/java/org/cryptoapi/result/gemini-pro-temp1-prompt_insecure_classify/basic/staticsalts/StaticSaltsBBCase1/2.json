    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = {(byte) 0xa2};",
    "description": "Using a constant value as the salt is not secure, as it makes the encryption predictable and easier to break. Salt should be randomly generated for each encryption operation.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random salt using a secure random number generator (e.g., `SecureRandom` in Java) before constructing the `PBEParameterSpec`."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "int count = 1020;",
    "description": "Using a low iteration count for the key derivation weakens the encryption strength. A higher iteration count makes it more computationally expensive to break the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a higher value (e.g., at least 10000) to improve the encryption strength."
