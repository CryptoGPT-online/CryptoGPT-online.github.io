    "description": "The number of iterations (`count`) for the PBKDF2 algorithm is set to a low value, which makes the resulting key less resistant to brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to a higher value, such as 100,000 or more, to make the key derivation process more computationally expensive and thus more resistant to brute-force attacks."
