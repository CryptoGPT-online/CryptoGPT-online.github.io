    "description": "The PBE algorithm (e.g. PBKDF2) with a low number of iterations is used for password hashing or encryption. This may lead to brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks, which could be risky.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to a higher value like 10000, or at least to 300000 on modern systems."
