        "description": "The code is manually seeding 'SecureRandom' which can lead to predictable randomness if the seed is not unpredictable and secure. Using a fixed seed or predictable seed increases the risk of an attacker being able to predict the output of the random number generator.",
        "recommendation": "Do not manually set the seed for 'SecureRandom', unless you are certain that the seed is unpredictable and secure. SecureRandom without a manually set seed will automatically use seed material provided by the OS which is designed to be cryptographically secure. If you must set a seed, ensure it is appropriately random and comes from a high-entropy source."
