    "description": "In the given code, the encryption algorithm is explicitly set to 'RC4' which is not a secure algorithm anymore. RC4 is being deprecated in many places and cannot be used for new encryption purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using 'RC4', consider using stronger encryption algorithms like 'AES'. Also, it is a good practice to not hardcode the encryption algorithm but to configure it externally or via a parameter."
