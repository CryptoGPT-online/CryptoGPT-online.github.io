    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l);",
    "description": "The seed value for the SecureRandom object is generated using the `nextLong()` method, which may not provide sufficient randomness. Using a predictable seed value can make it easier for an attacker to guess subsequent random numbers generated by the SecureRandom object.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for generating the seed value, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. This method uses a cryptographically secure random number generator that is suitable for generating high-quality random numbers."
