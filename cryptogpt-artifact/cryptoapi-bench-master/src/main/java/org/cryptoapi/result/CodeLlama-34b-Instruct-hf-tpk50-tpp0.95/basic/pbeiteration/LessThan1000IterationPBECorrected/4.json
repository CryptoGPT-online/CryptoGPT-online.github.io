{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",

"description": "The provided salt is too short and the iteration count is low, which can be easily brute-forced by an attacker. This can lead to the encryption key being cracked and the data being accessed.",
"recommendation": "Use a longer salt and increase the iteration count. It is recommended to use a salt of at least 16 bytes and an iteration count of at least 10000."

"description": "The provided random number generator is not cryptographically secure and can be easily guessed by an attacker. This can lead to the encryption key being cracked and the data being accessed.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
