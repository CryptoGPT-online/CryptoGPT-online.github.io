## False Positive Misuse

```json
[
    {
        "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_method": "Ed.go",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
        "description": "The CBC mode of operation is not recommended for AES encryption as it has known vulnerabilities. These include replay attacks where an attacker can capture an encrypted message and reuse it if the encryption key is known. AES in ECB mode of operation can be broken using frequency analysis.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure mode of operation like CTR for AES encryption. This will provide better security."
    }
