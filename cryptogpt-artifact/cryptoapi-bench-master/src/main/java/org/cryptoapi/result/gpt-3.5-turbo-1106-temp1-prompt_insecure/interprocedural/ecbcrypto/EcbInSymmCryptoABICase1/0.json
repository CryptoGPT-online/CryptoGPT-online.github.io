  "misuse": "Misuse of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode with Electronic Codebook (ECB) Mode",
  "vulnerable_code": "String crypto = \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\";",
  "description": "Using ECB mode can lead to security vulnerabilities in the encrypted data due to the deterministic nature of the encryption, making it easier for attackers to exploit patterns in the data.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM."
