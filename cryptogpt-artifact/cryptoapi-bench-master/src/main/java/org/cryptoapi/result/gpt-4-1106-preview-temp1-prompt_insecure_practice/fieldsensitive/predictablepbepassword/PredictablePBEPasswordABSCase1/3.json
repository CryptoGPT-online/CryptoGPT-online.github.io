        "description": "Although it uses SecureRandom, the salt should be unique and not reused across encryptions. Storing or reusing the same salt value would reduce the effectiveness of the salt.",

        "description": "The keyLength parameter in PBEKeySpec is set to 16, which implies that the resulting encryption key may be only 128 bits, depending on the default algorithm. Given the increase in computational power, stronger keys such as 256 bits are recommended.",
