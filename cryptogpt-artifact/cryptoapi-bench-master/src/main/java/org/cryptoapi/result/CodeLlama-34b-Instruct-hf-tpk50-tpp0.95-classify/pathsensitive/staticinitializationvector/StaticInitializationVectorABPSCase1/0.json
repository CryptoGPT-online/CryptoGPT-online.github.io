        "description": "The use of \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" is less secure than the recommended \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\" because it uses CBC mode, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Additionally, the use of \"PKCS5Padding\" is less secure than the recommended \"NoPadding\" because it adds padding that can be vulnerable to a timing attack.",
