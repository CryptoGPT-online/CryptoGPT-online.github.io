"description": "The URL class is using the default protocol (http) and the default port (80) to create the URL. However, the URL class does not validate the protocol and port, so it is possible to create an invalid URL that could lead to a security vulnerability.",
"recommendation": "Use a safer and more secure URL creation method, such as `new URL(url, protocol, port)` or `new URL(url, protocol)`."
