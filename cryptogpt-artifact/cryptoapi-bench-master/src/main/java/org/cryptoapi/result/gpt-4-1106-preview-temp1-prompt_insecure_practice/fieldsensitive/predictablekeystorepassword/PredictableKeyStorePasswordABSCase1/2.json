    "description": "The code loads a KeyStore from an arbitrary URL (google.com), which is not a legitimate certificate authority (CA) resource. This means the application could be tricked into trusting malicious certificates if an attacker has control over the network or DNS resolution.",

    "description": "The application uses a hardcoded key 'changeit', which is a common default password and widely known. This makes the KeyStore easily accessible if the code or compiled class file is obtained by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Remove hardcoded keys from the source code. Use a secure method to manage keys, such as a dedicated secrets management service or environment variables, and ensure they are properly protected and rotated regularly."

    "description": "The method 'method1' overwrites its parameter 'passedKey' with a static key stored in the class, effectively ignoring any dynamic key passed to it. This prevents the use of different keys for different sessions or instances, which is a fundamental security practice.",
    "recommendation": "Do not overwrite the 'passedKey' parameter. Ensure each instance or session can use a unique key, and manage the keys securely."
