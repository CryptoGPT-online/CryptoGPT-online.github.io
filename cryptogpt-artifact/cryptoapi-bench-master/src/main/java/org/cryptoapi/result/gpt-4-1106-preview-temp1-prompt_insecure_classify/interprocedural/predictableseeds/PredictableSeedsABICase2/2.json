        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
        "description": "The code is initializing a SecureRandom instance with a predictable seed (a single byte). This reduces the randomness of the values generated by the SecureRandom instance, making the output predictable and not suitable for cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Do not provide a seed when creating the SecureRandom instance; let the implementation pick a seed using its own entropy source. If a seed is necessary for testing, ensure that it is sufficiently random and unpredictable."
