 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD2\")",
"description": "The use of the MD2 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for any security-related purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which can allow an attacker to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-384 instead."
