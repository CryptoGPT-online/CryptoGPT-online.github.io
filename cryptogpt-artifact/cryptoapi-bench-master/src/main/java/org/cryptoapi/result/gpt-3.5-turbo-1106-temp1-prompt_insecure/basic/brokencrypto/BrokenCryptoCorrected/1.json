  "description": "The code generates a random AES key which should not be hardcoded in the source code as it can easily be exposed or compromised.",
  "recommendation": "Generate the key securely at runtime and store it in a secure location. Consider using a KeyStore to store the key in a more secure manner."},

  "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is not set for the cipher, which can lead to security vulnerabilities in the encryption process.",
  "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for each encryption operation and set it in the cipher using the init method."}]
