    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
    "description": "SHA-256 is considered a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for security-sensitive applications. SHA-256 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that two different messages can produce the same hash value. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as hash collision attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-3 or SHA-512 instead of SHA-256."
