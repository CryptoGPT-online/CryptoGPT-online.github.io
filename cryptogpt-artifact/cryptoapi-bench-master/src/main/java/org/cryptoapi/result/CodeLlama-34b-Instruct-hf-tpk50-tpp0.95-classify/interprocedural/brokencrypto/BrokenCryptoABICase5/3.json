        "description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is a broken algorithm that should not be used for new systems. It's also using the ECB mode, which is not semantically secure. Additionally, the key is generated using a fixed password and salt, which is a bad practice.",

An attacker could potentially manipulate the key generation to produce a predictable key, which could lead to a security vulnerability.",
