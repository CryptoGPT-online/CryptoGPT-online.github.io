    "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded in the code, making it easily discoverable for attackers.",

    "description": "The encryption algorithm AES is used, which is generally considered secure. However, the length of the keyBytes is not checked or set to a sufficient length, potentially weakening the encryption strength.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that keyBytes is set to a sufficient length (e.g., 128, 192, or 256 bits) to ensure strong encryption."
