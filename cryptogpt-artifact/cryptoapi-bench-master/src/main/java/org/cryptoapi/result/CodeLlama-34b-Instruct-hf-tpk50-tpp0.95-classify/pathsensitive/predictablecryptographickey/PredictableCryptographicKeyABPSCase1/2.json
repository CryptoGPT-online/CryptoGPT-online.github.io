 {
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = defaultKey.getBytes();",
"description": "The default key is a fixed value and is not generated randomly, which makes it vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the default key."
}

{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
"description": "The encryption key is only 16 bytes long, which is too short and may be vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Increase the length of the encryption key to a minimum of 32 bytes."
}

{
"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "String defaultKey = "defaultkey";",
"description": "The default key is hardcoded and can be easily discovered by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Do not hardcode credentials in the code. Instead, store them securely and retrieve them at runtime."
