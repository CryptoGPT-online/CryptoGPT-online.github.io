        "vulnerable_code": "DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_KEY",
        "description": "The code hardcodes the cryptographic key \"changeit\" and it is used directly in the code. This is considered a bad practice because hardcoding cryptographic keys can make them easily discoverable and potentially used by unauthorized individuals.",
        "recommendation": "Always use secure methods to store and retrieve cryptographic keys. Consider using environment variables, secure key vault services or secure encryption methods to secure your cryptographic keys."
