        "description": "The PBKDF2 algorithm (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a cryptographic algorithm designed to provide a strong key based on a password. However, the number of iterations for the PBKDF2 algorithm is often set at a very low value (like in this case: 11010). This could lead to weak key generation and therefore to weaker cryptographic protection.",
        "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a large enough number of iterations for PBKDF2 key generation, ideally 10.000 or more. As of 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends at least 100.000 iterations. It is also important to store the salt and iteration count along with the hash to avoid potential security issues."
