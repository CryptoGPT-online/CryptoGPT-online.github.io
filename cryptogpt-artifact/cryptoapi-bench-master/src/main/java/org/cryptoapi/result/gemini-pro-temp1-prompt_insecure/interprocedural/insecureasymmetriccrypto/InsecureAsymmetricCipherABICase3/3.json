    "description": "The key size for the RSA algorithm is set to a fixed value of 1024 bits, which is considered weak by today's standards. The recommended key size for RSA is at least 2048 bits to provide adequate security.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key size to a more secure value, such as 2048 or 4096 bits, to improve the strength of the encryption."
