"description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers, but in this code, it is being used to set the seed for the random number generator. This is a broken crypto algorithm, as it is deterministic and can be predicted. It can also introduce a bias in the random number generation.",
"recommendation": "Replace the SecureRandom class with a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as the CTRDRBG or the HMAC-DRBG, and use the generate() method to generate random numbers."
