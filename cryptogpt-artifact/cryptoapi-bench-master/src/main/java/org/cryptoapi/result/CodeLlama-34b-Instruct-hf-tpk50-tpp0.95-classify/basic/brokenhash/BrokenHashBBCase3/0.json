"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD4\")",
"description": "The use of MD4 as a cryptographic hash function is insecure and should be avoided. It is considered broken and can be easily reversed, allowing an attacker to obtain the original message.",
"recommendation": "Replace MD4 with a more secure cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
