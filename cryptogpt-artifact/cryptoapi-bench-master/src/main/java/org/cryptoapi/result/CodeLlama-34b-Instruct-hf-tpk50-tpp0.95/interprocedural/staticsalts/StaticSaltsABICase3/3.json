"description": "The provided code uses the PBEParameterSpec class to derive a key from a password, but does not specify the algorithm to use. This is a security risk as it allows the attacker to use the default algorithm, which may be weak.",
"recommendation": "Always specify the algorithm to use when deriving a key from a password. For example, use the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 algorithm to derive a key using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256."
