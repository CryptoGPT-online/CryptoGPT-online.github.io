        "description": "The method used to convert the SecureRandom output to a byte array may not provide sufficiently random values, as the ints() method returns an IntStream, which is then converted to a String and then to bytes. This can lead to predictable keys if the conversion does not preserve randomness.",

While a 16-byte key is the minimum length for AES and is not inherently weak, it is important to ensure that the key generation process is secure and provides adequate entropy. In this context, the key could potentially be weak due to the insecure conversion from SecureRandom to byte array.",
