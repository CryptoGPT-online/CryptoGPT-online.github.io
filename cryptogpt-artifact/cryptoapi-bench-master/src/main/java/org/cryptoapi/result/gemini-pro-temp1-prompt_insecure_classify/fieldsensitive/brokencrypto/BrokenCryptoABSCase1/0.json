Sure, here are the crypto API misuses in the provided Java code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(defaultAlgo);",
    "description": "The code is using a weak encryption algorithm, DES, which is no longer considered secure. DES has a key size of only 56 bits, which can be easily brute-forced.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, with a key size of at least 128 bits."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "if(passedAlgo.isEmpty()){\n            passedAlgo = defaultAlgo;\n        }",
    "description": "The code is allowing the client to specify the encryption algorithm to use. This is insecure because the client could choose a weak algorithm, such as DES, which would allow them to decrypt the data.",
    "recommendation": "Do not allow the client to specify the encryption algorithm. Instead, use a fixed, strong algorithm, such as AES."
  }
]
```

To fix these misuses, you should:

* Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, with a key size of at least 128 bits.
* Do not allow the client to specify the encryption algorithm. Instead, use a fixed, strong algorithm, such as AES.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
