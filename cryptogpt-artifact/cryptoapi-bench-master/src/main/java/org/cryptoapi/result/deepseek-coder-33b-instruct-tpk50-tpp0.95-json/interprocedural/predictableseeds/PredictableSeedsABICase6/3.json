        "description": "If you are trying to use a byte value as the seed for a SecureRandom instance, there might be a misuse. This is because the byte[] constructor of SecureRandom is usually used to set the seed value for the SecureRandom instance. However, this constructor is deprecated in Java 9 and removed from Java 11 onwards. The seed value should be derived from a long value. If the system time or some other form of non-deterministic system-provided value is used to generate the seed value, then this could potentially provide a stronger seed and make the random numbers more unpredictable. However, it depends on whether the 'seed' value is a truly unpredictable and sufficiently random number.",
        "recommendation": "The seed value should be derived from a long value. You can convert the byte value to an int and use it as the seed value for SecureRandom."
