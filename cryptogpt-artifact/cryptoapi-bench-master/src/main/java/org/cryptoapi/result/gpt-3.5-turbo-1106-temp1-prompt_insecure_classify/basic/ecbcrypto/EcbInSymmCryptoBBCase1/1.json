[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\");", 
  "description": "The code uses the ECB mode of operation for AES encryption, which is insecure because it does not provide sufficient security against ciphertext manipulation attacks. It is recommended to use a more secure mode of operation such as CBC or GCM.", 
  "recommendation": "Change the mode of operation to a more secure one such as CBC or GCM."}]
