"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEKeySpec",
"description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec with a random salt and iteration count, but the key length is fixed to 16 bytes. This makes it vulnerable to a rainbow table attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger key length, such as 256 bits, and generate a random salt for each encryption. Additionally, use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-512, for the password hashing."
