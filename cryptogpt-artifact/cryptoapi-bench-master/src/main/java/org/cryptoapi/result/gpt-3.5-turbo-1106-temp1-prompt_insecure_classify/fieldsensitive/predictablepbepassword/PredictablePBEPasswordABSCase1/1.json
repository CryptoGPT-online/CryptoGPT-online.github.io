    "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The salt value is generated using the SecureRandom class, but the length of the salt is not specified. This can lead to insufficient entropy, weakening the effectiveness of the encryption. Moreover, the salt should be securely generated and stored separately from the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the length of the salt and ensure it is securely generated and stored."
