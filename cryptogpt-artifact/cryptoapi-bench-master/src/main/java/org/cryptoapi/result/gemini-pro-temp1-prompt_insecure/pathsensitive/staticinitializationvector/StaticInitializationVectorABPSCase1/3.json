Sure, here's the JSON report on the crypto API misuses in the provided Java code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "Insufficient Initialization Vector (CWE-321)",
    "vulnerable_code": "`IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(bytes);`",
    "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is generated using a `SecureRandom` instance, but it's not guaranteed to be unique for each encryption operation. This can lead to predictable IVs, making the cipher vulnerable to攻擊.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation, and ensure that the IV is not reused."
  }
]
```

**CWE-321: Use of Hard-Coded or Predictable IV**
The code uses a static IV for all encryption operations, which is a security risk. The IV should be generated randomly for each encryption operation to ensure that the ciphertext is unpredictable.

**Recommendation:**
Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation. For example, you can use the `SecureRandom` class in Java to generate a random IV.

```java
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
byte[] iv = new byte[16];
sr.nextBytes(iv);

IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
```
