    "description": "The code uses DES algorithm in Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode. This mode of operation is deterministic, meaning that identical plaintext blocks always produce identical ciphertext blocks, making it vulnerable to various attacks.",
    "fix": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM, along with a strong encryption algorithm like AES."
