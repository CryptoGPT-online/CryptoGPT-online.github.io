    "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = \"abcde\".getBytes();",
    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded value (\"abcde\") as the initialization vector for the cipher. This makes the cipher vulnerable to attack, as an attacker can guess the IV and decrypt the ciphertext.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random IV and use it to initialize the cipher. For example, you can use the `SecureRandom` class to generate a random IV."
