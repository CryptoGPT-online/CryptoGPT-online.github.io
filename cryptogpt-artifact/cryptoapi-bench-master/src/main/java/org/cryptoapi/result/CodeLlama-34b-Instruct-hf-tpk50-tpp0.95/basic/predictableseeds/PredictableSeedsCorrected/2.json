"description": "The SecureRandom class is used with a predictable seed, which can be exploited to generate predictable random numbers. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as insecure key generation or nonce reuse.",
"recommendation": "Use a truly random seed, such as the current time or a random string from a secure random source, to ensure that the generated random numbers are cryptographically secure."
