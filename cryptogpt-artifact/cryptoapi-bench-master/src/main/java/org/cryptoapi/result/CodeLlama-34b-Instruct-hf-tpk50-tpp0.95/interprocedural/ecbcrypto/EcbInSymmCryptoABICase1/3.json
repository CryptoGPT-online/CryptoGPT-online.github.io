"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
"description": "The Cipher object is initialized with the AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding algorithm, which is vulnerable to attacks that involve manipulating the padding of the encrypted data. This can lead to a variety of security issues, including plaintext recovery and ciphertext manipulation.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure padding scheme, such as AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding or AES/GCM/NoPadding. Additionally, use a random Initialization Vector (IV) to prevent attacks that involve reusing the same IV for multiple messages."

"misuse": "Improper Random Number Generation",
"vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
"description": "The KeyGenerator class is used to generate a random key, but the key is generated using the default SecureRandom algorithm, which may not be sufficient for cryptographic use. This can lead to a weak key, which can be vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generation algorithm, such as SHA-1 or SHA-256, to generate the key. Additionally, use a secure seed to initialize the random number generator, and ensure that the seed is properly updated for each new key generation."
