"description": "The code uses a weak password for storing the cryptographic key. A weak password can be easily guessed by an attacker, which compromises the security of the system.",

"description": "The code uses the SecureRandom class to generate random numbers, but it does not use the correct constructor. This can lead to weak random numbers, which can compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Use the correct constructor for SecureRandom: SecureRandom(new SecureRandom())"
