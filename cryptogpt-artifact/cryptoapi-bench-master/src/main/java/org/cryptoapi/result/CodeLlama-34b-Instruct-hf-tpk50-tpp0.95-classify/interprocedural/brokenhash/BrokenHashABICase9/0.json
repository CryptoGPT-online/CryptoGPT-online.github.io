"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "String crypto = 'SHA1';",
"description": "The use of SHA-1 hash algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions, which can lead to a variety of attacks, including impersonation and manipulation of data.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger and more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of SHA-1."
