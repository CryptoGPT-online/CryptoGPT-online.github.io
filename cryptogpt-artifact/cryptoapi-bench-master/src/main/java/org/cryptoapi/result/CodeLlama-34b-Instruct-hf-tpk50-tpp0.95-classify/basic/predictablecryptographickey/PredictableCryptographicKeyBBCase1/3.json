"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.java:8-11",
"description": "The AES algorithm is being used with a hardcoded key, which is a well-known and vulnerable practice. This makes the encryption predictable and weak.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and random key, and do not hardcode it in the code. Additionally, consider using a newer and more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."

"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
"vulnerable_code": "P1.java:4",
"description": "The password is being hardcoded in the code, which makes it easily accessible to an attacker. This is a security risk, as an attacker could use the password to gain unauthorized access to the system.",
"recommendation": "Do not hardcode passwords in the code. Instead, use a secure and random password, and store it in a secure location. Additionally, consider implementing a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect."
