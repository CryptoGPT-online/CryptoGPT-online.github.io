"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",

"description": "The code uses the AES algorithm, which is a widely used and secure encryption algorithm, but it may not be secure if used with a weak key or if not properly implemented.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR, and ensure that the key is properly generated and stored."

"description": "The code hardcodes the default key, which makes it easy for an attacker to obtain the key and decrypt the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Do not hardcode credentials and use a secure method to store and manage them."

"vulnerable_code": "Co.algoSpec = \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\";",
"description": "The code specifies the AES algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding, which may be less secure than other algorithms or modes, such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm and mode of operation, such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR, and ensure that the key is properly generated and stored."
