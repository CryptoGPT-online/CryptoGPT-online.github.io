    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed size byte array for the salt and generates random bytes to populate it. However, the length of the salt should be determined by the cryptographic algorithm being used and should be at least the same length as the key. Using a fixed size like 32 can lead to weak encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Use appropriate salt length according to the cryptographic algorithm being used and ensure it is at least the same length as the key."
