    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Seeding of Random Number Generator",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is seeded with a small number of bytes, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic purposes. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger seed for the SecureRandom object, such as a combination of system entropy and a user-provided seed."
