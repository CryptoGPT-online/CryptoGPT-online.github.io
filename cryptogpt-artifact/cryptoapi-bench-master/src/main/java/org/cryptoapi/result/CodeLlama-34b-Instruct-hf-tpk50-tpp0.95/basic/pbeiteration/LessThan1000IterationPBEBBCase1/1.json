"vulnerable_code": "new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
"description": "Using a low iteration count in PBEParameterSpec can lead to weak encryption and potential for brute force attacks. A higher iteration count is recommended to increase the computational effort and make it more difficult for an attacker to perform a brute force attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 1000 or more, when creating a PBEParameterSpec. Additionally, consider using a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES or RSA, instead of PBE."
