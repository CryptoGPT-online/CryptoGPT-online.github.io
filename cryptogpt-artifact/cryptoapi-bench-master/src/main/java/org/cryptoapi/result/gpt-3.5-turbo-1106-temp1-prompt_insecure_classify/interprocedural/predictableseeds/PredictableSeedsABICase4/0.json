    "description": "The seed used for the SecureRandom object is derived from a char array converted to a byte array, which can lead to insufficiently random values.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure PRNG algorithm like SHA1PRNG and provide a properly generated seed or use SecureRandom without explicitly setting a seed."
