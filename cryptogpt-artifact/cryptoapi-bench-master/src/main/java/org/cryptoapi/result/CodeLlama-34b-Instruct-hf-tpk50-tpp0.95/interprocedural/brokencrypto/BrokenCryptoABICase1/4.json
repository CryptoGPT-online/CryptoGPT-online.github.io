"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding",
"description": "The use of DES encryption is insecure because it uses a relatively small key size and is vulnerable to attacks such as brute force and collision attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a larger key size, and use a secure mode of operation such as GCM or CBC with a random IV."
},

"misuse": "Fixed IV",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
"description": "The use of a fixed initialization vector (IV) can allow an attacker to predict the ciphertext and potentially access the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a random IV for each encryption operation, and store the IV with the encrypted data to allow for decryption."

"misuse": "No Authentication",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
"description": "The use of a cipher without authentication can allow an attacker to tamper with the encrypted data and potentially access the decrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a cipher with authentication, such as GCM or CCM, to ensure the integrity of the encrypted data."
