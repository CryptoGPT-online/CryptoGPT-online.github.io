"description": "The code implements X509TrustManager interface but provides empty implementations for the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, as the application will trust any certificate presented to it without performing any validation.",

"description": "The getAcceptedIssuers method should return a list of trusted certificate issuers, but the current implementation returns null. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as accepting self-signed certificates, which can compromise the security of the application.",
"recommendation": "Implement the getAcceptedIssuers method to return a list of trusted certificate issuers that are accepted by the application."
