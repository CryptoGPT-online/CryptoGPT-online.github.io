 {"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "P1",
"description": "The code uses PBEKeySpec with a fixed iteration count (11010), which can be brute-forced easily.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2, or increase the iteration count to a secure value (at least 100,000)."}
