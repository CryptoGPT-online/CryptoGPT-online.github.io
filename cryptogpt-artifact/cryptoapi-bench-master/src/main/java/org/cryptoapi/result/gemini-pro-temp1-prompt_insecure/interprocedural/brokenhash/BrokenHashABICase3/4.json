    "description": "The code uses the MD4 algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. MD4 is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
