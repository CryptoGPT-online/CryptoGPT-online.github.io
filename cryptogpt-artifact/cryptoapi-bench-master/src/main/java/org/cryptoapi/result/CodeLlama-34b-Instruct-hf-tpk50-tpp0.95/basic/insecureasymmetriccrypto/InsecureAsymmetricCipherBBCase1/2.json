"description": "The code uses the RSA algorithm, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm that can be vulnerable to attacks. The RSA algorithm is only secure when the key size is at least 2048 bits, but the code uses a key size of 1024 bits. Additionally, the code does not specify which mode of the RSA algorithm to use, which can lead to confusion and errors.",
"recommendation": "Replace the RSA algorithm with a secure and recommended cryptographic algorithm, such as AES. Also, make sure to specify the mode of the algorithm and use a key size of at least 2048 bits."
