    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(passedSeed);",
    "description": "Using a fixed or predictable seed for SecureRandom can result in the generation of weak or predictable random numbers. This can compromise the security of cryptographic operations that rely on randomness, such as key generation or encryption. In this case, the seed is derived from a constant array `defSeed`, which makes the random numbers predictable and vulnerable to attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (such as `java.security.SecureRandom`) that is properly seeded with a cryptographically strong random seed. Consider using a hardware random number generator or a combination of multiple entropy sources to improve the randomness of the seed."
