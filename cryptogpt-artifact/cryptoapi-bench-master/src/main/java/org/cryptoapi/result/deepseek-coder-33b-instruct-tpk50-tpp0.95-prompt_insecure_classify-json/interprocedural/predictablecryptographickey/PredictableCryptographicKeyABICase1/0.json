{
  "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
  "vulnerable_code": "byte[] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
  "description": "The code creates a AES key of 16 bytes from an arbitrary string. This can result in weaker encryption. AES can use different key lengths, such as 128, 192, and 256 bits. The standard is to use 128 bits (16 bytes).",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure key length. Also, it is good practice to use secure random number generation for cryptographic keys. Instead of using a hardcoded key, consider obtaining the key from a secure, external source."
