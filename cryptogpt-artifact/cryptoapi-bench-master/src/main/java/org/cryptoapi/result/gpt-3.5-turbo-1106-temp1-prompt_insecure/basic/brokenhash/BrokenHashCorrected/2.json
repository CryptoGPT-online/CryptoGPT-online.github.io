  "description": "The code is using SHA-256 which is not considered broken, but it's important to note that using a single iteration of SHA-256 for hashing password is not secure.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure and appropriate hash function for password hashing, such as bcrypt, scrypt, or argon2."}]
