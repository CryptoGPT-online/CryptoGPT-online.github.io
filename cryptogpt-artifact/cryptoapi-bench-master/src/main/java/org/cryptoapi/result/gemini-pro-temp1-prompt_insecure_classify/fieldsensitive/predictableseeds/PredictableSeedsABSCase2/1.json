Sure, here is the JSON report of the crypto API misuses in the provided code:

```
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{passedSeed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is initialized with a byte array containing a single byte. This is not a cryptographically strong seed and can lead to predictable random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, and seed it with a sufficient amount of entropy."
  }
]
```

In order to fix the issue, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to create a cryptographically strong random number generator and seed it with a sufficient amount of entropy, such as by using `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().generateSeed(256)`.
