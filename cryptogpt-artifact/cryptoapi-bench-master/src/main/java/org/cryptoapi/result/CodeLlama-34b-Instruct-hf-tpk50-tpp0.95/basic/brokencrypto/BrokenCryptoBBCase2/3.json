"description": "The use of the Blowfish encryption algorithm is considered broken and should not be used. It has been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including a collision attack that can lead to plaintext recovery.",
"recommendation": "Replace Blowfish with a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES."
