        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm chosen by the program is RC4, which is a weak cryptographic algorithm and has been vulnerable to attacks for a long time. It's now officially considered insecure and should not be used. This could allow attackers to easily decrypt the data.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm like AES, which is currently the most secure option. You can get an instance of a secure random number generator through the 'SecureRandom' class in Java."
