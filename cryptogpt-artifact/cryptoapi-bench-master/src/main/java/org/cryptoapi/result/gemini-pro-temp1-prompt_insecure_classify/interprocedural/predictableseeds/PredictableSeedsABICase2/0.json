    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a byte array containing a single byte as the seed. This makes the random number generator predictable and easy to guess, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure source of randomness, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` or `SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG")` to generate the seed for the SecureRandom object."
