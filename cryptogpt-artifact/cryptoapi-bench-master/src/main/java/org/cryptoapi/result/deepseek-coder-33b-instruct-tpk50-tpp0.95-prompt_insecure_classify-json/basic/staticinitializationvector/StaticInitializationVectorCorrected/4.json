        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] bytes = new byte[16];\nsr.nextBytes(bytes);",
        "description": "In this code, the IV (initialization vector) is generated using SecureRandom's nextBytes() method, which is considered as a secure method for generating random numbers. However, this IV is generated only 16 times and is not random enough. For AES, a 128-bit IV is required, which should be randomly generated.",
        "recommendation": "Instead of using SecureRandom's nextBytes() method to generate the IV, a method that produces a high-quality random number, such as a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) should be used."
