  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nbyte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
  "description": "The usage of SecureRandom for generating a salt is correct, but the salt length of 32 is excessive and not appropriate for this context. Additionally, the count value of 1020 is an insecure choice for the iteration count in PBEParameterSpec.",
  "recommendation": "Use a standard salt length of 16 bytes for PBKDF2. Also, the iteration count should be set to at least 10,000 or more for secure key derivation."}]
