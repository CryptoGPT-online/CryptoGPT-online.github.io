    "description": "The code is using the SecureRandom class to generate random bytes for the salt. However, it is only using a fixed size of 32 bytes. The number of bytes generated should be based on the recommended length for the specific cryptographic algorithm being used.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator and generate a salt of the appropriate length for the chosen cryptographic algorithm."
