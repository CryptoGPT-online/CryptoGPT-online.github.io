    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = null;\nint iteration = hm.get(\"bbb\");",
    "description": "The code uses a variable `iteration` as the iteration count for the PBES2 algorithm, which is retrieved from a HashMap. Using a user-controlled value as the iteration count can lead to a denial-of-service attack, as an attacker could provide a very large value to exhaust system resources.",
    "recommendation": "Use a fixed, secure value for the iteration count, or perform input validation to ensure that the iteration count is within a safe range."
