"description": "The code is using the RSA algorithm to perform encryption, which is a broken algorithm and should not be used for encryption purposes. It is recommended to use a secure encryption algorithm such as AES.",
"recommendation": "Replace the RSA algorithm with a secure encryption algorithm such as AES. Additionally, it is important to use a secure padding scheme such as OAEP to prevent attacks such as padding oracles."
