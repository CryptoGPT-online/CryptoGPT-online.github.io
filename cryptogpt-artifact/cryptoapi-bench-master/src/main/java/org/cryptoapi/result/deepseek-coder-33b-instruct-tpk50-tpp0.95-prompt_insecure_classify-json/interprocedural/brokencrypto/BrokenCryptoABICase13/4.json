  "description": "The algorithm 'RC4' has been proven to be insecure, and it is not recommended for general use. Using RC4 in modern applications may lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Consider using a secure cipher such as 'AES', 'DES', 'RSA', 'ECDSA', etc. instead of 'RC4'. Remember to also update the key generation code to match the selected cipher."
