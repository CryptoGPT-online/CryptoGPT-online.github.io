"description": "The use of the default SSLSocketFactory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. The default SSLSocketFactory is not configured to check the hostname of the server, making it possible for an attacker to intercept the connection and pretend to be the server.",
"recommendation": "Use a custom SSLSocketFactory that is configured to check the hostname of the server, or use a third-party library that provides this functionality."
