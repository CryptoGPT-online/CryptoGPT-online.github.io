    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] salt = new byte[32];\nrandom.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed size salt of 32 bytes, which may not be sufficiently random. This can weaken the security of the cryptographic operation.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random salt with a sufficient length, such as 64 bytes or more, using a secure random number generator."
