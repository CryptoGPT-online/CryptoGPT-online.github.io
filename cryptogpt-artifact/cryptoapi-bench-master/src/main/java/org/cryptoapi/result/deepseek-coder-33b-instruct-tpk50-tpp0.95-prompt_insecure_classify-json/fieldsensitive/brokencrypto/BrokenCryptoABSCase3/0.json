    "vulnerable_code": "C4 crypto = new C4(\"RC4\"); crypto.encrypt(\"abc\",\"\");",
    "description": "The code is using RC4 as its cryptographic algorithm which has been shown to have vulnerabilities, including cryptographic weaknesses and biases. RC4 is considered broken and no longer considered secure.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a strong and secure cryptographic algorithm instead. One of the recommended algorithms is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). If the use of RC4 is necessary, it is strongly recommended to use a key size of at least 128 bits, and the use of a good padding scheme is also important."
