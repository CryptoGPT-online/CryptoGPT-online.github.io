    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] bytes = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};\nsr.setSeed(bytes);",
    "description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom object is too small (only 2 bytes). This makes it easier for an attacker to guess the seed and predict the sequence of random numbers generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger seed, such as one generated from a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG), to initialize the SecureRandom object."
