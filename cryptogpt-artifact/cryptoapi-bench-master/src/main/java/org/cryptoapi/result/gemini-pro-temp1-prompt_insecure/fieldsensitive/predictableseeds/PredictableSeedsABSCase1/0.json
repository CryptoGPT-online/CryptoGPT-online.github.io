    "description": "The seed used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is predictable, which may allow an attacker to guess the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator and seed it with a truly random value, such as from `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."
