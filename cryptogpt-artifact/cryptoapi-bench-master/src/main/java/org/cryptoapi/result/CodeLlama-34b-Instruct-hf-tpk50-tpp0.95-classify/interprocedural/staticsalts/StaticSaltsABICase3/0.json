{
"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "count2 = c",
"description": "The value of `count` is passed directly from the user-provided input `args` to the constructor of `PBEParameterSpec`, which can lead to weaknesses in the encryption algorithm if the value of `count` is too small.",
"recommendation": "Validate the value of `count` before passing it to the constructor of `PBEParameterSpec` and ensure that it is large enough to provide adequate encryption strength."
