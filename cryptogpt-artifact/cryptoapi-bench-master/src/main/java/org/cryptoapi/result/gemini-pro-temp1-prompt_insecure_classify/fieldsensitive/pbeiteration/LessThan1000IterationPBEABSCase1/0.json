Sure, here is the security analysis of the provided code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used without a seed, which means that the generated random numbers may be predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom` with a strong seed."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, passedCount);",
    "description": "The number of iterations used in the PBKDF2 algorithm is too low. This makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to at least 10,000."
  }
]
```

The code does not contain any misuses of the `javax.crypto` API.
