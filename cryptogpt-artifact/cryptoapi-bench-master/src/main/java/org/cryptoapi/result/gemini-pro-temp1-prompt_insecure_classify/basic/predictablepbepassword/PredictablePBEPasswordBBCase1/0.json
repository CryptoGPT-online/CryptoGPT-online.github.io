    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is not properly seeded, which can lead to predictable or weak random values. An attacker could exploit this to guess or manipulate the generated salt value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is properly seeded with a strong source of entropy. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Additionally, consider using a larger salt size to make it more difficult for an attacker to guess or manipulate."

    "description": "The number of iterations and key length used in the key derivation function (KDF) are insufficient. This can lead to weak encryption and make it easier for an attacker to brute-force the password.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations and key length to provide a higher level of security. For example, you can use at least 100,000 iterations and a key length of 256 bits."
