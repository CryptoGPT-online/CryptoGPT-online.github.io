    "description": "Using a static seed for the SecureRandom instance makes the generated values predictable, which can be exploited in cryptographic attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using a static seed for SecureRandom. Instead, use a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG) such as /dev/urandom on Unix systems or CryptGenRandom on Windows."
