    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "sr2.nextBytes(seed);",
    "description": "The seed in the code is hard-coded to {100, 200}. Since it is hard-coded, it means the same sequence of random numbers will be generated for each time the program is run. This makes the code not truly random, which is often undesirable in security applications.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a seed that is truly random. You can use SecureRandom's nextBytes() method to generate a seed that is truly random."
