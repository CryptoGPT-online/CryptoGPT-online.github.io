    "description": "Using 'String.valueOf(random.ints())' results in predictable randomness since it calls 'ints()' without specifying a bound, leading to a stream of potentially unlimited integer numbers that are not suitable for secure password generation.",

    "description": "Converting byte array to String and then to a char array is an insecure way of setting a KeyStore password. When using 'String.getBytes', platform's default charset could lead to non-uniform behavior across different environments. Moreover, the randomness is not guaranteed because of the usage of 'ints()' without a limit.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid using the SecureRandom integer stream for password generation. Instead, securely generate a random number of appropriate length with SecureRandom's 'nextBytes' function, and use that byte array directly or encode it securely (e.g., Base64 encode) for its usage as password."

    "recommendation": "Implement proper exception handling that ensures sensitive information is not leaked and any cryptographic operations are not continued in an insecure state."
