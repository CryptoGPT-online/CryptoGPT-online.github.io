"description": "The method uses the insecure cryptographic algorithm PBE (Password-Based Encryption) with a low iteration count of 11010, which can be brute-forced easily. This can lead to unauthorized access to the encrypted data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm with a higher iteration count, such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or bcrypt."
