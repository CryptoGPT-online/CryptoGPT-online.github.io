{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom.setSeed(seed)",
"description": "The code is using the default SecureRandom instance to set the seed for generating random numbers. This instance is not cryptographically secure and can be vulnerable to attacks that exploit the predictable nature of the generated random numbers.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as the java.security.SecureRandom class, to set the seed for generating random numbers. This will help prevent attacks that exploit the predictable nature of the generated random numbers."
