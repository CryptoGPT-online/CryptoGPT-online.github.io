[{"misuse": "Hardcoded Encryption Key", 
  "vulnerable_code": "String key = 'defaultkey';",
  "description": "The encryption key is hardcoded in the source code, which poses a security risk as it can be easily obtained by an attacker. Hardcoded keys should be avoided in favor of securely storing and managing keys.",
  "recommendation": "Store the encryption keys securely outside of the source code, such as in environment variables or a secure key management system."}]
