[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();", "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random values for cryptographic operations. In this code snippet, the SecureRandom instance is created without specifying a specific algorithm or seed. This means that the default algorithm and seed will be used, which may not provide sufficient random values for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "It is recommended to specify a specific algorithm and seed when creating a SecureRandom instance. For example, SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() should be used to create a SecureRandom instance with a strong algorithm and seed."},{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.", "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);", "description": "In this code snippet, the keyBytes array is truncated to a length of 16 bytes, indicating the use of a 128-bit key. This may result in insufficient encryption strength, as longer keys provide stronger encryption. Additionally, it is not clear how the key is derived from the random values generated. It is recommended to use a key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to derive a strong key from the random values.", "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, to derive a strong key from the random values.
