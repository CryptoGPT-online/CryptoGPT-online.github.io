AES is considered weak in some contexts. For example, the original AES has a block size of 128 bits and supports three key sizes (128, 192, and 256 bits).",        "recommendation": "It is important to always specify a key size when using AES. In the case of the AES algorithm in Java, you can use the KeyGenerator.init(int keysize) method, like so: KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\"); keyGen.init(256);"    }]
