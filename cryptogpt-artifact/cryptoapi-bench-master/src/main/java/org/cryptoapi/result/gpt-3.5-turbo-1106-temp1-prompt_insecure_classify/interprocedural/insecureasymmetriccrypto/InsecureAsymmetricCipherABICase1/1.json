    "description": "The code uses the RSA algorithm for generating a key pair. However, using RSA with a key size of 1024 bits is now considered insecure and vulnerable to attacks. A minimum key size of 2048 bits is recommended.",

    "vulnerable_code": "String myMessage = new String(\"Secret Message\");",
    "description": "The code is using a String object to hold the plaintext message. Using a String for storing sensitive information like passwords or secret messages is insecure because Strings are immutable and remain in memory, making them susceptible to memory dumps and other memory-based attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a char[] or byte[] to store sensitive information and clear it from memory once it is no longer needed."
