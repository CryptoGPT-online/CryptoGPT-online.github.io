    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");\nSecretKey key = keyGen.generateKey();",
    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded key for encryption. This makes the key susceptible to discovery by attackers, potentially compromising the security of the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a hard-coded key, the code should generate a random key each time it needs to encrypt data. This can be done using the `SecureRandom` class."

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(crypto);",
    "description": "The code uses the `crypto` variable to specify the cryptographic algorithm to use. However, the `crypto` variable is user-controlled and can be set to any value, including insecure or broken algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "The code should only allow a fixed set of secure cryptographic algorithms to be used. This can be done by using a whitelist or by checking the algorithm name against a list of known-good algorithms."
