        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"Blowfish\")",
        "description": "The use of the Blowfish encryption algorithm is considered broken and insecure. It uses a 64-bit block size and a 128-bit key size, which is not sufficient to protect against modern attacks. Instead, use a more modern and secure algorithm, such as AES.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of the Blowfish algorithm with a more modern and secure algorithm, such as AES."
