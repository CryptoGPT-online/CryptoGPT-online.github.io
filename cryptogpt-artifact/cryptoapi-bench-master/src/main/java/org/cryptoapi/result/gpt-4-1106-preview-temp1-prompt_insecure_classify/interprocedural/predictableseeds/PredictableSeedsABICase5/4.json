        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
        "description": "Using a fixed seed value can lead to the generation of predictable random numbers, which can be exploited. In this code, the seed is provided by the user, and if it is not sufficiently random or too short, it could compromise the randomness of SecureRandom.",
        "recommendation": "Do not set a fixed seed for SecureRandom unless it is necessary for reproducibility in a non-security context. If reproducibility is not required, allow SecureRandom to self-seed using its default entropy sources."

        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte [] seed = {(byte) 100, (byte) 200};",
        "description": "The seed is set with a hard-coded, very short byte array, which does not provide adequate entropy for cryptographic operations. A short seed like this can lead to weak cryptography because it is easy to guess or brute force.",
        "recommendation": "Use a longer, more random seed for cryptographic operations. Ideally, the seed should be generated using a secure mechanism provided by the platform, such as calling SecureRandom without setting a seed."
