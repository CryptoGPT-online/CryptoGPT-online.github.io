  "description": "The DEFAULT_CRYPTO value is hardcoded as 'SHA1', which is a weak hashing algorithm. Moreover, the use of toCharArray() function to convert the string to character array doesn't provide secure randomness.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 and consider using a secure random number generator for generating cryptographic keys and initialization vectors."},

 {"misuse": "Misuse of Cryptographic API",
  "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
  "description": "The method to retrieve the MessageDigest instance is using the String.valueOf() method on the char array 'crypto', instead of passing a proper cryptographic algorithm name as a string. This can lead to unpredictable behavior.",
  "recommendation": "Use a proper cryptographic algorithm name directly as a string parameter in MessageDigest.getInstance() method."}]
