        ],
        "description": "Setting the seed of a SecureRandom instance reduces the randomness because it initializes the random number generator with a value that was just produced by the same generator. This can make the generator more predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Do not set the seed of SecureRandom after it has been used to generate random values, unless you are sure you need to reproduce a sequence of values for a specific purpose. If needed, securely generate and store a seed value for future use."
