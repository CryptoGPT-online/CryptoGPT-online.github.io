"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto))",
"description": "The use of a hardcoded cryptographic algorithm, in this case, the MD5 algorithm, is considered a risky practice because it has known vulnerabilities and is no longer considered secure. The recommended solution is to use a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256, and to use a cryptographically secure random number generator to select the algorithm at runtime.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of MD5 with a secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256, and use a cryptographically secure random number generator to select the algorithm at runtime."
