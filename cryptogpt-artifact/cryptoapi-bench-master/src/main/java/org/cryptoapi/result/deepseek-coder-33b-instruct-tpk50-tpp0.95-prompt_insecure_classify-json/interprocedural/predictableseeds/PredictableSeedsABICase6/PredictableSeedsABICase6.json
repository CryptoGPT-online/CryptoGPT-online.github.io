### False Positive Misuse ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
        "description": "The given code uses a byte as a seed for a SecureRandom object, which is not secure as the range of byte values is too small (from -128 to 127) to produce random sequences. Predictable or weak seeds can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "Use a larger data type for the seed value, such as an array of bytes or a string. A larger data type will provide a larger range of values and make it harder for an attacker to guess the seed."
    }
]
```
This misuse is false positive as the byte `seed` is passed to `SecureRandom` which is a cryptographic API misuse. The `seed` is of type byte which can have up to 256 (2^8) possible values, which means the generator might not have enough entropy. However, this misuse does not involve risky or broken algorithms which should be highlighted.
