    "description": "Using the default SSLSocketFactory without specifying the protocol version and cipher suites can lead to weak encryption algorithms being used, which may not be secure enough to protect sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure SSLSocketFactory implementation that supports modern encryption protocols and cipher suites, such as TLSv1.2 with AES-256 encryption."
