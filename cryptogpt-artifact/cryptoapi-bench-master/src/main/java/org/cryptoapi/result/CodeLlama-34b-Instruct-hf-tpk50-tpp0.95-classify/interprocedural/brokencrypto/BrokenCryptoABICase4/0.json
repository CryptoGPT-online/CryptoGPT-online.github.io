        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto)",
        "description": "The `KeyGenerator` class uses the provided cryptographic algorithm name to generate a key. In this case, the `crypto` variable is set to \"RC2\", which is a weak and insecure algorithm. Using weak or broken cryptographic algorithms can easily be exploited by attackers.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure and randomized cryptographic algorithm instead. Consider using a well-established and widely adopted algorithm such as AES."
