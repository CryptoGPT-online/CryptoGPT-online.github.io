    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" as the cipher transformation for encryption. AES with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding is generally considered secure and recommended. However, it is advisable to use a more secure mode of operation like AES/GCM/NoPadding for better security.",
    "recommendation": "Change the cipher transformation to \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\" for improved security."
