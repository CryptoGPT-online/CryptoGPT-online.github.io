        "description": "The seed for SecureRandom is derived from a fixed value, leading to predictable random values which can weaken cryptographic operations.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the setSeed call to allow SecureRandom to use its default, more secure seeding strategy. If a seed is necessary, use a more unpredictable source."

        "description": "The seed for SecureRandom is only two bytes long, which does not provide enough entropy for cryptographic operations and makes the seed easily brute-forceable.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the seed has sufficient entropy, ideally by using a secure mechanism provided by the SecureRandom API itself or by sourcing it from a high-entropy source."
