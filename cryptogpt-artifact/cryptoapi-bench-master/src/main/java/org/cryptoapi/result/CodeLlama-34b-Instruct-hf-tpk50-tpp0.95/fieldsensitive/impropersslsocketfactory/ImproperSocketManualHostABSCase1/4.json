 {"misuses":[{"misuse":"Broken Crypto Algorithm","vulnerable_code":"C1.encrypt","description":"The method C1.encrypt uses a broken crypto algorithm, specifically the SSLSocketFactory.getDefault() method, which creates a socket with a weak cipher suite. This can leave the communication vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.","recommendation":"The method should use a stronger cipher suite, such as SSLv2Hello, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, or TLSv1.3, by specifying the desired protocol in the SSLSocketFactory constructor."},{"misuse":"Insecure Use of Crypto API","vulnerable_code":"SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()","description":"The SSLSocketFactory.getDefault() method returns a socket with a weak cipher suite, which can leave the communication vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.","recommendation":"The method should use a stronger cipher suite, such as SSLv2Hello, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, or TLSv1.3, by specifying the desired protocol in the SSLSocketFactory constructor."}]}
