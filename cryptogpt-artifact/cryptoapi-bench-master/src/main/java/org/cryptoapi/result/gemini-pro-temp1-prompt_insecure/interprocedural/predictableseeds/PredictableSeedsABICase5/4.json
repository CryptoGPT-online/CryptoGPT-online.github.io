    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The `seed` variable is not properly initialized, which can lead to predictable random number generation. This can be exploited to compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and seed it with a high-quality random seed. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to get a CSPRNG and `SecureRandom.generateSeed(int numBytes)` to generate a high-quality random seed."
