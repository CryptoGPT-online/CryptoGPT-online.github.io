        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
        "description": "The use of SecureRandom.ints() without specifying a bound generates an IntStream, which is then converted to a string. This does not guarantee a sufficient amount of entropy as it depends on the default string representation of IntStream, which is not designed for cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom to generate a byte array directly for cryptographic key generation, ensuring sufficient randomness and entropy."

    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);",
        "description": "The key is being padded to ensure it is 16 bytes long, which implies the use of AES with a 128-bit key. While AES-128 is still considered secure, it is weaker than AES-256. Additionally, if the generated key is shorter than 16 bytes, the Arrays.copyOf method will pad the array with zeros, reducing the key's strength.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the key has sufficient length and randomness appropriate for the encryption algorithm used, possibly by using a cryptographic key derivation function."
