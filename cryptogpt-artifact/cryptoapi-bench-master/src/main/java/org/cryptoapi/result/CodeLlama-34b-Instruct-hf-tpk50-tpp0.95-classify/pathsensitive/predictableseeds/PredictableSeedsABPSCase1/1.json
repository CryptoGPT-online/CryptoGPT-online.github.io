"description": "The code uses `SecureRandom` class to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. However, the seed used for `SecureRandom` is not properly set. The `setSeed` method is called with a static array of bytes, which may not be secure. It is recommended to use a proper seeding mechanism to ensure that the random numbers generated are truly random and unpredictable.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure seeding mechanism, such as `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\").setSeed(mySeed)` where `mySeed` is a properly seeded SecureRandom object."
