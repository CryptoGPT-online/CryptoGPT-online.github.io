    "vulnerable_code": "byte b = hm.get(\"aaa\");\nSecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{b});",
    "description": "The code uses a weak key generation algorithm, SecureRandom(byte[]) with a single byte as the seed, which is highly predictable and easy to guess.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) with a strong seed, such as SecureRandom(byte[]), and seed it with a high-quality source of randomness, such as /dev/urandom on Linux or CryptGenRandom on Windows."
