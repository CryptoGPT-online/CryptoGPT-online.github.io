    "description": "In the provided code, a PBE (Password-Based Encryption) Parameter Specification is created with the given salt and iteration count, but the specification is never used. This is a misuse because if the specification is never used, there's no encryption happening, and thus, the code is simply generating a random salt and a count, but not using these in the encryption process.",
    "recommendation": "To use the generated PBE Parameter Specification, the code should be using it in creating a PBE key. For example, using it in a PBEKeySpec object to generate a SecretKey object which could be used in Cipher object for encrypting or decrypting data."
