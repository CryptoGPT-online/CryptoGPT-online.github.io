    "description": "This code creates a secure random number generator that produces random numbers suitable for cryptographic use. However, if an instance of SecureRandom is created without seed, the current time is used as seed. If an attacker is able to guess the time between the creation of the SecureRandom instance and the creation of the IvParameterSpec, they could be able to predict the IV used in the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using SecureRandom, consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator. You can use SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() if your JDK supports it."
