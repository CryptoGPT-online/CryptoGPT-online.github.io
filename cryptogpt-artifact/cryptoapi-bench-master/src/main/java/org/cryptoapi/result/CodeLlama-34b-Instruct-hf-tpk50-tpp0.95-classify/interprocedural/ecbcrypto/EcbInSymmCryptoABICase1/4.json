        "description": "The code uses the \"AES\" algorithm to generate a key, which is a symmetric-key block cipher that is widely used and considered secure. However, the code does not specify a key size, which could lead to the use of a weak key (e.g. 128-bit).",
        "recommendation": "Specify a key size when generating a key using the KeyGenerator.getInstance() method, to ensure that a strong key is used."

        "description": "The code uses the \"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\" cipher, which is a block cipher that uses a fixed block size (16 bytes) and a padding scheme (PKCS5Padding). The padding scheme used is not secure and can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a different padding scheme, such as \"AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding\", which is a more secure option."
