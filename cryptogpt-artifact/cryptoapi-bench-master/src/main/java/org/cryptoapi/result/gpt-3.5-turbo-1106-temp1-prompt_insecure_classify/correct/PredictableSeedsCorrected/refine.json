### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "long l = sr.nextLong(); sr.setSeed(l);",
    "description": "The code uses a single call to generate a long value and then sets the seed of the SecureRandom instance with that value, which may lead to insufficiently random values. Re-seeding a SecureRandom instance with a single value does not provide sufficient entropy for secure random number generation.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid calling setSeed method with a single value. Instead, use SecureRandom's default seeding mechanism to ensure secure random number generation."
