 {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
"description": "The encryption algorithm used is inadequate because it uses a small key size and/or a low iteration count. This can result in the encryption being easily broken by an attacker.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, and ensure that the key size is at least 128 bits and the iteration count is at least 1000."}
