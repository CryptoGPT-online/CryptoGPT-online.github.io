 ### False Positive Misuse ###

I don't see any false positives in your provided code. All reported misuses are genuine weaknesses in your cryptographic operations.

        "description": "The choice of PBKDF2 as a key derivation function is considered weak and risky. It's recommended to use a stronger algorithm.",

        "vulnerable_code": "sr2.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "The salt is only randomly generated if the choice is greater than 1. This is not secure because the salt will always be the same if the choice is 1 or 2. This will make it easier for an attacker to brute force the keys.",
        "recommendation": "The salt should be randomly generated for every key derivation. Even if the choice is less than or equal to 1, the salt should be random."
