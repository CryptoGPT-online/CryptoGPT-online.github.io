        "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l);",
        "description": "Setting the seed of a SecureRandom instance reduces the entropy of the generated numbers if the seed is not random enough. In this case, the seed is set to the value of a previously generated random number, which can make the randomness predictable.",
        "recommendation": "Do not manually set the seed for SecureRandom unless you are certain that the seed has high entropy and is secure for cryptographic use. Typically, it is best to allow SecureRandom to self-seed."
