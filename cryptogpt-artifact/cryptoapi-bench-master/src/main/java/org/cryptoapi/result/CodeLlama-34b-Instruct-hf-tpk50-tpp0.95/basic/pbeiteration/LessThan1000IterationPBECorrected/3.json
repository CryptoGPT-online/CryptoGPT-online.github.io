{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor with a large iteration count value can cause a vulnerability known as 'key stretching'. This is because the iteration count is not checked for values larger than 2^30, which can cause the algorithm to take an excessive amount of time to complete, leading to a denial of service attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a smaller iteration count value, or use a more secure key stretching algorithm, such as bcrypt or scrypt."
