"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, count)",
"description": "The `PBEParameterSpec` constructor takes a byte array as the salt and an integer as the iteration count. However, the `count` variable in `method2` is never used, so the iteration count is always 0. This is a vulnerability because it allows attackers to perform a dictionary attack more easily.",
"recommendation": "Use the `count` variable in the `PBEParameterSpec` constructor to set the iteration count. This will make the password hashing more secure."
