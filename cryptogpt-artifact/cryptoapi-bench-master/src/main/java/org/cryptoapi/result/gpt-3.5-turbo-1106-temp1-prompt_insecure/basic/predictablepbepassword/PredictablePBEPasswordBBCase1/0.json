  "description": "The use of a constant string 'saagar' as a password with low iteration count (11010) may result in weak key derivation, making the encryption vulnerable to brute force attack.",
  "recommendation": "Choose a strong random password and use a higher iteration count (e.g., 100,000 or more) for key derivation."}]
