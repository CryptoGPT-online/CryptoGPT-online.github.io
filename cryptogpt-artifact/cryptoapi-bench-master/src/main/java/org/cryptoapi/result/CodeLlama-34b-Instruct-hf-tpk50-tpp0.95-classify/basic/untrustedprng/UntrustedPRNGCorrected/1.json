  {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nint x = random.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println(x);",
    "description": "The use of `SecureRandom` is not recommended because it is based on the SHA1PRNG algorithm, which has been shown to be weak and predictable. The algorithm is also vulnerable to birthday attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator such as `java.security.SecureRandom` or `org.bouncycastle.crypto.prng.SP800SecureRandom`."
  }

Note: The `SecureRandom` class is not recommended for use in cryptographic applications due to its vulnerabilities.
