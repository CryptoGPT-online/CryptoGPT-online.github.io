        "description": "The PBEKeySpec class in Java constructs a key specification for PBE algorithms. The iteration count is set to 11010, which is significantly larger than the recommended minimum value of 10000. A larger iteration count makes password-based encryption slower, making brute force attacks more difficult but also less likely to be effective.",
        "recommendation": "Modify the iteration count to a value between 10000 and 50000. It's recommended to have a minimum iteration count of 30000 for security reasons."
