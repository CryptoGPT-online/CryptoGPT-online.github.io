    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is seeded with a constant value, which makes it predictable and insecure. An attacker could potentially guess the seed and predict the sequence of random numbers generated.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (RNG) that is properly seeded with a cryptographically strong random seed. For example, you can use `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` to create a secure RNG."
