    "description": "The choice variable is used to determine whether to use the SHA-256 algorithm. However, the choice is hardcoded to 2, which means SHA-256 is always selected regardless of other factors.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method for algorithm selection, such as reading the desired algorithm from a configuration file or using a more robust condition for selection."
