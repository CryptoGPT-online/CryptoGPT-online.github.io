    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");",
    "description": "The code uses AES without specifying the key length. This can result in weak encryption strength and potential compromise of sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Specify an appropriate key length when generating the AES key, such as 256 bits, to ensure strong encryption."

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
    "description": "The code uses CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to recover plaintext from encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure mode of operation, such as GCM, with a secure padding scheme like OAEP."
