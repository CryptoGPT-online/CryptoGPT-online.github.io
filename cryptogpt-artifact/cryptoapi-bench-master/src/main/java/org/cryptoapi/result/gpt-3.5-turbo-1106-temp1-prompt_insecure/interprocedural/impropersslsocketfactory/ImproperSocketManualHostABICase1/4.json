{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", 
 "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory ssf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
 "description": "The code uses the getDefault() method of SSLSocketFactory, which may not always return a secure implementation. It could potentially return a weaker or vulnerable SSL/TLS implementation.",
 "recommendation": "Use a specific SSL context with appropriate secure protocols and algorithms instead of relying on the default implementation."}
