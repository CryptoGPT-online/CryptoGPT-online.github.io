In this case, the hard-coded key is the initialization vector (IV) used for encryption. It should be replaced with a randomly generated IV for each encryption operation.", "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated IV for each encryption operation, and do not use hard-coded cryptographic keys."}], "description": "The code contains a vulnerability related to the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys. It is a serious vulnerability because it can be easily exploited by an attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted data.", "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated IV for each encryption operation, and do not use hard-coded cryptographic keys."}
