"description": "The IV is generated using SecureRandom, which is not a cryptographically secure RNG, and can lead to a weak IV that can be predicted and lead to plaintext attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure RNG such as /dev/urandom or the Random class from the Java Security API to generate the IV."

"description": "The AES algorithm used in this code is vulnerable to attacks such as padding oracle attacks, which can lead to the decryption of the ciphertext.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305, and use a secure mode of operation such as GCM or CTR mode."
