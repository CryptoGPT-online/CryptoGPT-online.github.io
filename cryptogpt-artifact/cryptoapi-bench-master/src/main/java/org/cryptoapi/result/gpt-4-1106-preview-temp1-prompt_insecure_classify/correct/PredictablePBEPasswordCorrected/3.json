    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The keyLength parameter determines the length of the generated key. Specifying a key length of 16 bits is extremely insecure for any encryption algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a longer key length that is considered secure, typically at least 128 bits for symmetric encryption algorithms."

    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "Converting the output of random.ints() directly to a string may not provide a sufficiently random value, depending on the implementation and usage.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the random values used for passwords or cryptographic keys are generated in a secure manner, using a strong random number generator and appropriate encoding."

    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(),salt,iterationCount,keyLength);",
    "description": "The use of PBEKeySpec with a short key length and without specifying the encryption algorithm might result in the use of a weak or outdated cryptographic algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a strong encryption algorithm when using PBEKeySpec and ensure the key length is adequate. For example, use PBKDF2 with a hash function like SHA-256 and a key length of at least 128 bits."
