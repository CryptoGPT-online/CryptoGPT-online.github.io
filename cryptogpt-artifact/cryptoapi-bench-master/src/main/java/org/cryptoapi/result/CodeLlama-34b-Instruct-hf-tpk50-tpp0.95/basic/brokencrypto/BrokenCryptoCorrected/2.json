"description": "The use of the `KeyGenerator` class to generate an AES key is not secure. The `KeyGenerator` class generates random keys, but it does not provide any guarantee that the keys are secure. The `AES` algorithm is known to be vulnerable to attacks, and it should not be used for key generation.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key generation algorithm, such as `SecureRandom` or `SHA1PRNG`, to generate the AES key. Additionally, use a secure padding scheme, such as `PKCS#7` or `PKCS#5`, to ensure that the padding is not predictable."
