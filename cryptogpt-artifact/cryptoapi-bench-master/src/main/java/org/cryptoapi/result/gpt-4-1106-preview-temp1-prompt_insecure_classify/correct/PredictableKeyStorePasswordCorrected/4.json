        "description": "This code snippet is insecure as it does not validate SSL certificates when opening a stream to an URL which can lead to Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. The trust manager that validates the certificate chain is not set, which means any certificate will be trusted.",
        "recommendation": "Implement and use a custom trust manager that validates the server's SSL certificate against a list of trusted certificates or use the default trust manager provided by the Java platform."
