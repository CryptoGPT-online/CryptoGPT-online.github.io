"description": "The Blowfish algorithm is considered insecure and should not be used. It has a weak key schedule and can be broken using a known-plaintext attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, instead of Blowfish. Additionally, use a secure key generation method, such as using a cryptographically secure random number generator, to generate the key."
