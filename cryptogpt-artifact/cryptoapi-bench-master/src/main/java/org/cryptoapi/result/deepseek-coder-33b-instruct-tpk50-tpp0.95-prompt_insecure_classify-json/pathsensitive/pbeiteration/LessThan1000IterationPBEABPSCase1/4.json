        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); random.nextBytes(salt);",
        "description": "This code uses a `SecureRandom` object to generate a random salt. The salt is then used as an input to `PBEParameterSpec` which is used to parameterize the encryption algorithm. However, the value of `count` is not random, instead it is hardcoded to 1050. In cryptographic contexts, using non-random values can lead to weak encryption keys and other vulnerabilities.",
        "recommendation": "You can use a `SecureRandom` object to generate a random number for `count` to ensure its value is random."
