    "vulnerable_code": "random.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "Using `SecureRandom.nextBytes()` to generate salt for a password-based encryption algorithm is not considered cryptographically secure. This is because `SecureRandom` is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which means it generates a sequence of numbers that appears random but is actually deterministic. This means that an attacker could potentially guess the salt value, which would allow them to decrypt the encrypted data. It is recommended to use a strong random number generator (RNG) such as `java.security.SecureRandom` instead.",
    "recommendation": "Replace `SecureRandom` with a strong RNG like `java.security.SecureRandom` to generate the salt."
