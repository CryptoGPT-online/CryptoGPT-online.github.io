    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "private static char[] CRYPTO = DEFAULT_CRYPTO.toCharArray();\ngo2();",
    "description": "The code uses a hardcoded default crypto algorithm (\"Blowfish\") without allowing for negotiation or considering the strength of the algorithm. This can lead to the selection of a weak or outdated algorithm, making the encryption less secure.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding the default algorithm, consider using a more secure and modern algorithm, such as AES-256, and allow for algorithm negotiation during key exchange to ensure the use of a strong algorithm."
