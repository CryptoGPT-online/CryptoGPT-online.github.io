    "vulnerable_code": "md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");",
    "description": "The code is selecting the SHA-256 algorithm only if the choice is greater than 1. This implies that if the choice is 1 or any other lower value, the code will use the less secure SHA-1 algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong cryptographic algorithm like SHA-256 or above consistently instead of making a choice based on a variable value."
