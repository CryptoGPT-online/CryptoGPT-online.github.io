[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "BigInteger i = BigInteger.valueOf(sr.nextInt());", "description": "The code uses a single integer generated by SecureRandom as the initialization vector (IV) for the AES cipher. This provides a weak IV and can lead to cryptographic weaknesses.", "recommendation": "Generate a random byte array of sufficient length using SecureRandom and use it as the IV."}]
