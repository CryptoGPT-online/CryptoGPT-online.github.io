[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.", 
"vulnerable_code": "int x = randomGenerator.nextInt();",
"description": "Using the default constructor of Random class, it's generally assumed to produce a set of pseudorandom numbers that are seeded from the system clock. This means, if the clock time is predictable (e.g., if the system clock is set or synchronized to a known value at some point), the generated numbers are also predictable.",
"recommendation": "To fix this issue, a better random number generator should be used, or a seed should be supplied to the random number generator that's not easily guessable. One method of achieving this in Java is to use the java.security.SecureRandom class."}]
