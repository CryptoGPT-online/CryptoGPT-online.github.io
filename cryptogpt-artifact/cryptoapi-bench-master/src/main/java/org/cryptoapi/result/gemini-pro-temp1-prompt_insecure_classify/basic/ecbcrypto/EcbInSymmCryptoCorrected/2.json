    "description": "The code uses AES without specifying the key size. By default, AES is initialized with a 128-bit key, which is considered insecure for many applications. It is recommended to use a key size of at least 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger key size for AES, such as 256 bits. This can be done by passing the desired key size to the `KeyGenerator` instance."
