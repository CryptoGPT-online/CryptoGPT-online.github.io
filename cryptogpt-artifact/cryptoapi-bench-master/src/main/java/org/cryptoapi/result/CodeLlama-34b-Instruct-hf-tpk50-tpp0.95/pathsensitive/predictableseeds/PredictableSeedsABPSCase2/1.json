"description": "The SecureRandom class is implemented using the SHA1PRNG algorithm, which is vulnerable to the attacks described in CWE-338. The code uses the SecureRandom class to generate a seed for the random number generator, which is then used to generate a random number. However, the seed generated by SecureRandom is not a strong seed, and can be predicted by an attacker. This can lead to the random number being predictable as well, which can compromise the security of the application.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, use a more secure seed generation algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. Additionally, consider using a secure random number generator that is not based on the SecureRandom class, such as the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) RandomNumberGenerator class."
