    "description": "The code is using the java.util.SecureRandom class to generate random numbers. However, it is using a fixed seed value, which makes the generated random numbers predictable and not truly random.",
    "recommendation": "To generate truly random numbers, it is recommended to use a truly random seed value or let the SecureRandom class generate its own seed."
