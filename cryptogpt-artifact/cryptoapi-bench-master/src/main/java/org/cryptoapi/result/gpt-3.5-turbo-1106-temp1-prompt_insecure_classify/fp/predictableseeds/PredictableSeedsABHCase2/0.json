    "description": "The SecureRandom class is used to generate random numbers, but it is not explicitly specified which cryptographic algorithm is used. It is safer to specify the algorithm explicitly to ensure a secure and reliable source of randomness.",

    "vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(seed);",
    "description": "The setSeed() method is used to seed the SecureRandom object with a value. However, the value being used is not sufficiently random, as it is derived from a fixed byte array. This can lead to predictable random number generation.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more random and unpredictable source to seed the SecureRandom object, such as a secure random number generator or data from user input."
