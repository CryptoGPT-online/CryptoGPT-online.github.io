[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "byte [] bytes = i.toByteArray();", "description": "The code generates a random BigInteger and converts it to a byte array. However, this technique does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "Use a proper cryptographic random number generator, such as SecureRandom, to generate a random byte array."},{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES\");", "description": "The code uses the default key size for the AES algorithm, which is considered too weak for secure encryption.", "recommendation": "Specify a stronger key size, such as 128 or 256 bits, when generating the AES key."},{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");", "description": "The code uses AES with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding. While AES is a secure algorithm, CBC mode requires an unpredictable initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation, which is not provided in this code. Additionally, PKCS5Padding is susceptible to padding oracle attacks.", "recommendation": "Use AES with a more secure mode, such as GCM, and specify a secure source of random IV for each encryption operation. Consider using authenticated encryption to prevent padding oracle attacks."}]
