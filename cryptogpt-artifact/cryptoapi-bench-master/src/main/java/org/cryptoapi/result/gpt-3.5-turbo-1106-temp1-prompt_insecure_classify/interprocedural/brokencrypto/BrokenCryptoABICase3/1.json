  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
  "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator.getInstance(crypto);\nCipher.getInstance(crypto);",
  "description": "The code uses the RC4 algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure due to its vulnerabilities. Using RC4 for encryption can lead to security issues and should be avoided.",
  "recommendation": "Replace the RC4 algorithm with a more secure algorithm such as AES."
