    "description": "The actual usage or algorithm is not specified, and therefore it is not possible to evaluate it for things like insecure algorithms. However, some common password-based encryption algorithms are known to be weak. In practice, this can be insecure unless a strong algorithm and secure usage are ensured.",
    "recommendation": "Use secure algorithms like PBKDF2 with HmacSHA256 or SHA512. Make sure to use a proper algorithm specification when initializing PBEParameterSpec objects."
