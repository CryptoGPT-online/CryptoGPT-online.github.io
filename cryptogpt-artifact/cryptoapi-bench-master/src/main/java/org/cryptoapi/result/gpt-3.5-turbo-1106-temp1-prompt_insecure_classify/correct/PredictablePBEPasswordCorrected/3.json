[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());", 
  "description": "The use of random.ints() method for generating a password does not provide a cryptographically secure random value. It should use a secure random number generator for generating passwords.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) such as SecureRandom to generate the password."}, 
 {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;", 
  "description": "The iteration count of 11010 is relatively low and may result in weak key derivation. It is recommended to increase the iteration count to enhance the key derivation strength.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count to strengthen the key derivation process, ideally using a value that provides an acceptable balance between security and performance."}]
