    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Entropy",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a seed that is derived from the `seed` variable, which is a character array. This seed is not cryptographically strong and can be easily guessed or brute-forced, leading to predictable random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that is initialized with a strong seed, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."
