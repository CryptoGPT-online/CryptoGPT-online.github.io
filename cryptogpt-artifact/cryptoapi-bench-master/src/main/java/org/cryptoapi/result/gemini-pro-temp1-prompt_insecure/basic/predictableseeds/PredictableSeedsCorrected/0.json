    "description": "The code uses the same instance of `SecureRandom` to generate a seed and then immediately sets the seed using that same value. This means that the sequences of random numbers generated will be predictable and not truly random.",
    "recommendation": "Create a new instance of `SecureRandom` for each use or use a different seed each time."
