"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",

"description": "The method 'KeyStore.getInstance(type)' is used to get an instance of the KeyStore class, but the argument 'type' is not properly validated, which can lead to the use of a weak or broken crypto algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Always validate the 'type' argument and ensure that it is set to a secure and up-to-date crypto algorithm."

"misuse": "Insecure Random Number Generation",
"vulnerable_code": "String.valueOf(random.ints())",
"description": "The method 'String.valueOf(random.ints())' is used to generate a password, but the 'Random' class is not secure and should not be used for this purpose. The 'SecureRandom' class should be used instead to generate cryptographically secure random numbers.",
"recommendation": "Replace 'Random' with 'SecureRandom' and use the 'nextBytes' method to generate a password."
