        "description": "The algorithm used for hashing in the `go` method is not secure. The `crypto` variable is initialized with a default value of `SHA1`, which is considered insecure and should not be used for new applications. A more secure algorithm such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512` should be used instead.",
