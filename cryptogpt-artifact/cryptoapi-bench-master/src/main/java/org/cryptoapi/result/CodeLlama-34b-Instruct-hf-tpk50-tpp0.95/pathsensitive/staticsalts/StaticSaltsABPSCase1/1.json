"description": "The salt used in the PBE parameter specification is not securely generated. The salt is generated by a SecureRandom instance, but the seed used to initialize the SecureRandom instance is not securely generated. This can result in predictable salt values, which can be easily guessed by attackers.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, use a securely generated seed to initialize the SecureRandom instance, such as /dev/urandom on Unix-based systems or CryptGenRandom on Windows."
