[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": "long l = sr.nextLong();",
  "description": "The code is using the nextLong() method of SecureRandom class to generate a random long value, but it is not a suitable way to generate a random seed for SecureRandom. The nextLong() method uses a default seed value and a linear congruential formula to generate random numbers, which is not cryptographically secure.",
  "recommendation": "The correct way to generate a random seed for SecureRandom is to use the nextBytes() method to generate a byte array and then pass that byte array to the setSeed() method."}]
