    "description": "The code is using a static key with a fixed length of 16 bytes for AES encryption. This can weaken the encryption strength and make it easier for attackers to break the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random and sufficiently long key for AES encryption. Consider using a key size of 128 bits (16 bytes) or larger."
