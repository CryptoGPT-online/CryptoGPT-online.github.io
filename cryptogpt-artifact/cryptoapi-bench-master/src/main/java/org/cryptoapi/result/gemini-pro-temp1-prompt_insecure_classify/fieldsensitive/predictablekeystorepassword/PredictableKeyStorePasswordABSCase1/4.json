    "description": "Loading a keystore from an unverified URL without proper certificate validation makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the certificate, potentially leading to the compromise of the keystore and the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Validate the certificate of the URL before loading the keystore. This can be done by using a trusted certificate authority (CA) or by implementing a custom certificate validation mechanism."
