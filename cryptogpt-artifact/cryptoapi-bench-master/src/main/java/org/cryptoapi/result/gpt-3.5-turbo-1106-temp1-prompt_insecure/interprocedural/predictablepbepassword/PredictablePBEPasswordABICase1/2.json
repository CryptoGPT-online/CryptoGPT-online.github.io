  "description": "Using a key length of 16 may be considered weak for certain encryption algorithms and could lead to vulnerability.",

  "description": "Using a default constructor for SecureRandom may not be secure enough for cryptographic purposes. Additionally, the way 'salt' is generated may not guarantee the necessary randomness for secure key generation.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator and ensure proper seeding for secure random data generation. Consider using a cryptographic service provider like 'java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()'."}]
