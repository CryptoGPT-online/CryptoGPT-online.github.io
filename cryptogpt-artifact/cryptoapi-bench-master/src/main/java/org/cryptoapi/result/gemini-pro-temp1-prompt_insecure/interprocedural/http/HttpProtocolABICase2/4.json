    "description": "Hard-coding passwords or other secrets in source code is a security risk. Anyone with access to the source code can easily extract the secret and use it to compromise the system.",

    "vulnerable_code": "The code uses `String.toCharArray()` to convert the URL to a character array, which is not secure.",
    "description": "Converting a string to a character array in Java does not provide any encryption or protection. The character array can be easily converted back to a string, which could expose sensitive information.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper encryption mechanism to protect sensitive data. Consider using a cryptographic library such as Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) or Bouncy Castle to encrypt the URL."

    "vulnerable_code": "The code constructs a `URL` object using the `url` character array without validating it.",
    "description": "Using untrusted input to construct a URL can lead to various attacks, such as Malformed URL attacks or Open Redirect attacks. An attacker could provide a malicious URL that could compromise the system or redirect users to malicious websites.",
    "recommendation": "Validate the `url` character array before constructing the `URL` object. This can be done by checking for invalid characters, checking the length of the URL, or using a regular expression to ensure that the URL has a valid format."
