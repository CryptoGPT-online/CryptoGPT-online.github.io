    "description": "Using a weak key for encryption. The key is generated using `String.valueOf(random.ints())`, which does not guarantee a cryptographically strong key. Additionally, the key is converted to bytes using `getBytes(\"UTF-8\")`, which may introduce additional vulnerabilities, such as padding or truncation.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator to generate a key. Consider using a key derivation function (KDF) to derive a key from a passphrase or other secret."
