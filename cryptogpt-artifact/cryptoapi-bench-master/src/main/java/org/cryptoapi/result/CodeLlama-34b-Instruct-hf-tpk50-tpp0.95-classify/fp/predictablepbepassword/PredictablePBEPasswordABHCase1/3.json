 {"misuses": [
{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "P1.key() method", "description": "The method uses a weak key derivation function (PBEKeySpec) with a low iteration count (11010) and a small key length (16 bytes). This can lead to a weak key and make the encryption insecure.", "recommendation": "Use a stronger key derivation function such as Argon2 or bcrypt with a higher iteration count and a longer key length."},
{"misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials", "vulnerable_code": "defaultKey variable", "description": "The variable 'defaultKey' is hardcoded with a randomly generated string. This can lead to a security vulnerability if the hardcoded string is used as a password or secret key.", "recommendation": "Do not use hardcoded credentials. Instead, use a secure method to generate a random password or secret key, such as using the SecureRandom class."},
{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom.getInstance() method", "description": "The method 'getInstance()' is used to create a SecureRandom object without specifying a provider. This can lead to the use of a weak or insecure random number generator, which can compromise the security of the encryption.", "recommendation": "Use a secure method to create a SecureRandom object, such as using the 'getInstanceStrong()' method, or specify a provider for the SecureRandom object."}
