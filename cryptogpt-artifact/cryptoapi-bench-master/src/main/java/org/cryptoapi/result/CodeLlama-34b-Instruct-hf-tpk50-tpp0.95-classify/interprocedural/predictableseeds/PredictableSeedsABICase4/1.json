 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())})",
"description": "The `SecureRandom` constructor with a single `byte` argument is not secure. It is vulnerable to a birthday attack, which can allow an attacker to predict the next random number. This can lead to compromised encryption and authentication.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure randomness source, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` or `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")`"
