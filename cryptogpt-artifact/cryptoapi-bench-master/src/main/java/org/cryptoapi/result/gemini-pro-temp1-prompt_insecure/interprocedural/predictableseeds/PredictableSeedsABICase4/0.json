    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Entropy",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{Byte.parseByte(seed.toString())});",
    "description": "Using a single byte as the seed for `SecureRandom` is not sufficient to generate unpredictable random numbers. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong and unpredictable seed for `SecureRandom`. This can be achieved by using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) or by combining multiple sources of randomness."
