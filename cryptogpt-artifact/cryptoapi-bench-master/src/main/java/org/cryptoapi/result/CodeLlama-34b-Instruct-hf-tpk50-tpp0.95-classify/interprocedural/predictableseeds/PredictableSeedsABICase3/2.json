"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "go3() function",
"description": "The SecureRandom class in Java uses a default seed value of 456789, which is not a secure seed value. In this code, the seed value is being set to a constant value, which can be easily guessed and may lead to predictable random values.",
"recommendation": "Use a random seed value for the SecureRandom class. You can use the SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() method to create a strong SecureRandom instance. This method uses a seed value generated by the operating system's random number generator, which is a more secure and unpredictable seed value. You can also use a secure random number generator library such as OpenSSL or NaCl to generate a seed value."
