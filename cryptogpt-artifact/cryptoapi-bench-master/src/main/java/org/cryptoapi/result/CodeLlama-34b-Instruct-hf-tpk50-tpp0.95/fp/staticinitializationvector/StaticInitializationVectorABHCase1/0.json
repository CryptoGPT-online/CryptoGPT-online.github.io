"description": "The use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. The PKCS5Padding scheme can be exploited by an attacker to decrypt the ciphertext. It's recommended to use a secure padding scheme such as AES/GCM/NoPadding or AES/CCM/NoPadding.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding with a secure padding scheme such as AES/GCM/NoPadding or AES/CCM/NoPadding."
