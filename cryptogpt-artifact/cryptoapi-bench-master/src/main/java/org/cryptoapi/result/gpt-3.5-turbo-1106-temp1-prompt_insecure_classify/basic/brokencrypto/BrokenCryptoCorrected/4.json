[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\");",
  "description": "The code is using AES encryption algorithm, which is not broken or risky. However, it is highly recommended to use AES-GCM for its better security guarantees in terms of confidentiality and integrity.",
  "recommendation": "Use AES-GCM instead of AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding for better security."}]
