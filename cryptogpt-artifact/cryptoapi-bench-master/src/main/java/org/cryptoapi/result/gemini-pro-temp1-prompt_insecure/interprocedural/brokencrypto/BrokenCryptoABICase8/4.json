    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses the \"RC2\" algorithm, which is considered weak and insecure. RC2 is susceptible to various attacks and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES or ChaCha20 instead of RC2."
