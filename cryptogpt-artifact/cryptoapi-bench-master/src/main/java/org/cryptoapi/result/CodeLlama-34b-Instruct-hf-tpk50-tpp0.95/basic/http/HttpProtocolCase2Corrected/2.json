        "description": "The `URL` class is not securely configured. The `URL` constructor takes a string argument and returns a `URL` object that represents the URL. However, the constructor does not perform any validation on the input string, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker could provide a malicious input string that contains malware or phishing links.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure URL validation library, such as `apache-validator`, to validate the input string before creating the `URL` object. You can also use `java.net.URL` instead of `java.net.URLConnection` to validate the URL."

        "description": "The `openConnection()` method establishes a connection to the URL without any security considerations. This can lead to insecure communication, which can expose sensitive data or lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. For example, an attacker could intercept the connection and inject malicious content.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure communication protocol, such as HTTPS, to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. You can also use `java.net.URL` instead of `java.net.URLConnection` to create a secure connection."
