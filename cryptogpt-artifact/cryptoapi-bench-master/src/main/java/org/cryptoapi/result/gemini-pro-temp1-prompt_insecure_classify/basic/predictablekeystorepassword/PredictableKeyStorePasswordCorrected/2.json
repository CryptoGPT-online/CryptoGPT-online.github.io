    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "vulnerable_code": "String password = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The password used to protect the keystore is generated using a random number generator and then converted to a string. This is a weak way to generate a password, as it is easy for an attacker to guess. Additionally, the password is stored as a plain string in the code, which makes it vulnerable to being stolen.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong password generator to create a password for the keystore. The password should be at least 12 characters long and contain a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Store the password in a secure location, such as a password manager."
