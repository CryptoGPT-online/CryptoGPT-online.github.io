    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed});",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with a seed value that is not sufficiently random. This can make it easier for an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated by the `SecureRandom` object, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure method of generating the seed value, such as using `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. This method will generate a seed value that is cryptographically strong and resistant to attack."
