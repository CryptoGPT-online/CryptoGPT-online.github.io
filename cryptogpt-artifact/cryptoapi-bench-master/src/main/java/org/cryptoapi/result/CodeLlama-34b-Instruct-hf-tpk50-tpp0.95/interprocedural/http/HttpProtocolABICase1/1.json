"description": "The method 'go' uses the 'new URL' constructor without specifying the protocol, which can lead to a vulnerability where the code may be redirected to an unexpected URL, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
"recommendation": "Replace the 'new URL' constructor with a secure version that specifies the protocol, such as 'new URL(protocol, url)', where 'protocol' is a string representing the protocol to use, e.g. 'http' or 'https'."
