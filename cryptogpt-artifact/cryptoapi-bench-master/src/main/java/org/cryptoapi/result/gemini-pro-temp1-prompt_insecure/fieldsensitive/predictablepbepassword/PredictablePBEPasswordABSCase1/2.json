    "vulnerable_code": "`PBEKeySpec` with iteration count 11010",
    "description": "PBEKeySpec uses PBKDF2withHmacSHA1 by default, which is considered a legacy algorithm. The iteration count of 11010 is also too low for modern security requirements.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure key derivation function with a higher iteration count, such as Argon2."

    "vulnerable_code": "Using the default password `sagar`",
    "description": "The password `sagar` is a common password and is easily guessable. This makes it easy for an attacker to brute-force the password and access the encrypted data.",
