From the provided code and the listed misuses, it's difficult to determine if any misuses are false positives without knowing the exact context in which it is running. However, based on the code snippet provided, we can eliminate false positives and provide an optimized list of cryptographic API misuses. 

False Positives: None, as all listed misuses are not in code context.

Optimized Misuse JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\")",
    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in the code is RSA, which might be weak. The use of RSA is not recommended in new code.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the RSA with AES algorithm, which is more secure and efficient."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "choice",
    "description": "The variable 'choice' controls the size of the RSA key. It is set based on a user-supplied parameter, which might make it predictable or vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random key size or use a key size that's based on a cryptographically secure random number."
  }
]
