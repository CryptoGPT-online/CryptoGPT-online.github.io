  "description": "The salt is being generated using the random.nextBytes method. The secure generation of cryptographic keys requires a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator specifically designed for cryptographic operations, such as the KeyGenerator class for generating keys and Initialization Vectors (IVs) for symmetric ciphers."},

  "description": "The count variable is directly used as the iteration count for the PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm without any validation or constraints. This could potentially lead to weak encryption.",
  "recommendation": "Ensure that the count value is within a secure range, and consider using a predefined constant or a minimum recommended value for the iteration count of the PBE algorithm."}
