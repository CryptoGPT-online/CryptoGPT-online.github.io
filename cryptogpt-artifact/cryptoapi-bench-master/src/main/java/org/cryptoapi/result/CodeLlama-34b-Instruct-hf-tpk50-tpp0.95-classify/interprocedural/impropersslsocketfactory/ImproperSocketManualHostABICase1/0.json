        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();",
        "description": "The code uses the `getDefault()` method of the `SSLSocketFactory` class to create an `SSLSocket` instance. This method returns the default `SSLSocketFactory` implementation, which may use less secure encryption algorithms or have other security vulnerabilities. Instead, the code should explicitly specify the desired security protocol, such as TLSv1.2, and create the `SSLSocketFactory` instance using the appropriate constructor or method.",
        "recommendation": "Replace `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` with `SSLSocketFactory.getInstance(\"TLSv1.2\")` or another appropriate security protocol. Additionally, consider using a secure random number generator to generate the salt for the encryption key."
