    "description": "The code uses the AES algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding padding. However, the default key size used is 16 bytes, which is not considered strong enough for AES encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Generate and use a stronger key with a length of at least 128 bits (16 bytes) for AES encryption."

    "recommendation": "Avoid using hardcoded keys. Generate a random key for each encryption operation or securely store and retrieve the key from a protected location."
