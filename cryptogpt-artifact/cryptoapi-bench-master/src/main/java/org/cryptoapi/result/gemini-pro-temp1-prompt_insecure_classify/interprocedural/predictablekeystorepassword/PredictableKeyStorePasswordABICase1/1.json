    "description": "The code loads a keystore from a URL without validating the certificate of the server. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and provide a malicious keystore.",
    "recommendation": "Use a method that validates the certificate of the server, such as `HttpsURLConnection.setHostnameVerifier` or `SSLContext.init` with a `TrustManager` that validates the certificate."
