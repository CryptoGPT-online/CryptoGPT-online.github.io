  "description": "The key is generated from a string by getting its byte representation and then padding it to 16 bytes. This approach to key generation is insecure and can lead to weak keys.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate cryptographic keys, such as SecureRandom class, and use a reputable key derivation function like PBKDF2 to derive a key from a password."}]
