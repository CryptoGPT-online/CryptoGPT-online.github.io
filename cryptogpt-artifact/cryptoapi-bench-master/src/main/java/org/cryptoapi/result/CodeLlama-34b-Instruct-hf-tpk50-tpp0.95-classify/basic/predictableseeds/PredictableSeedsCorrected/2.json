"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "sr.setSeed(l)",
"description": "The `SecureRandom` class is used to generate random numbers, but the `setSeed` method is used to set a fixed seed value, which reduces the entropy of the random numbers generated. This can lead to predictable patterns in the generated numbers, which can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security of the application.",
"recommendation": "To fix this misuse, do not use the `setSeed` method of the `SecureRandom` class. Instead, use the `nextLong` or `nextInt` methods to generate random numbers."
