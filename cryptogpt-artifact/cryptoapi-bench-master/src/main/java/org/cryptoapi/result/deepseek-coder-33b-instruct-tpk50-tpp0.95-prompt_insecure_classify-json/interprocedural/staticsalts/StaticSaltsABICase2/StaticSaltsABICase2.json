 ### False Positive Misuse ###

In the given code, the misuse of "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" is a false positive because the salt and count in the PBE (Password Based Encryption) operation are not hardcoded. The salt is generated by converting a constant string to a character array, while the count is just a integer which is also not hardcoded.

The misuse of "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" is also a false positive misuse as it refers to the salt which is not directly used for encryption. The count is just an input used in the PBE operation, but it is not hardcoded.

The misuse of "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" is also false positive as the PBE operation is not used in the code.
