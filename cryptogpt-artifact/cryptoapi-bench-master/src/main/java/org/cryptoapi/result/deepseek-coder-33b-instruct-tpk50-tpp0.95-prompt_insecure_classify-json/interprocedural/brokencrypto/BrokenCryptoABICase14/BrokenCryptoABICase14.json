### Optimized Misuse JSON
The false positive misuse is present in the original list. The code is using the RC2 algorithm which is categorized as a CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm by OWASP. The algorithm has several known vulnerabilities and is not recommended for secure applications. However, the code has been hardcoded to use the RC2 algorithm, hence this finding is a false positive. Thus, no optimized misuse is required as the misuse reported is due to the code's design and not to the used algorithm.
