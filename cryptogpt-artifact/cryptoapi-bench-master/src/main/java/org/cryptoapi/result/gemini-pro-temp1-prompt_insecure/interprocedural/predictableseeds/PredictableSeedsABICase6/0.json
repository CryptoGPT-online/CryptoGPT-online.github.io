    "misuse": "Weak Seed Generation (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_code": "byte seed = 100;",
    "description": "The seed used to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance is a simple byte value (100). This makes it predictable and easy to guess, which can compromise the security of the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong seed to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance. This can involve combining multiple sources of randomness, such as the system time, a hardware random number generator, or a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)."
