    "description": "The seed value for the SecureRandom instance is provided by the user through the \"seed\" argument of the method2() method. In this code, the \"seed\" is a byte array. The \"seed\" can be predicted by the user since it is hard-coded in the main() method.",
    "recommendation": "The \"seed\" should not be used directly as it can be predicted by the user. It should either be randomly generated or derived from a password using a SecureRandom instance."
