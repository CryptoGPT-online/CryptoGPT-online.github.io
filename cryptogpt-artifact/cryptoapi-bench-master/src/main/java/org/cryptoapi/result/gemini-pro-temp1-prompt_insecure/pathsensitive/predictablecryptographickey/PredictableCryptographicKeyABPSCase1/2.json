    "description": "The code uses `SecureRandom.ints()` to generate a key, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. This can result in a weak key that can be easily broken.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")`, to generate a key."
