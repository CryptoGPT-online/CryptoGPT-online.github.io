        "vulnerable_code": "int count = 20;",
        "description": "The iteration count is set to 20, which is a low value for password hashing. This can lead to weak hashes that can be easily cracked by an attacker.",
        "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count, such as 1000 or higher, to make the password hashing process more computationally expensive and increase the resistance to brute force attacks."
