"description": "This code implements a custom X509TrustManager, which allows for the ability to trust arbitrary certificates. This can lead to insecure communication if the custom implementation does not properly validate certificates.",

"description": "This code returns an empty X509Certificate array from the getAcceptedIssuers() method, which means that it will trust any certificate. This can lead to insecure communication.",
"recommendation": "Remove the custom X509TrustManager implementation and use a secure default implementation instead."
