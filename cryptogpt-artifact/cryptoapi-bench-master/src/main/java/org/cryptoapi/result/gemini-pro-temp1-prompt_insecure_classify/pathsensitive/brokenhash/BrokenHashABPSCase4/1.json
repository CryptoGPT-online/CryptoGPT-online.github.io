    "description": "The MD2 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD2 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD2 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
