    "description": "SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that has been found to be vulnerable to collision attacks. This means that it is possible to find two inputs that produce the same output, which can be used to compromise the security of systems that rely on SHA-1 for authentication or integrity verification.",
    "recommendation": "Replace SHA-1 with a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
