    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nkeyBytes = String.valueOf(random.ints()).getBytes();",
    "description": "The code is using the SecureRandom class to generate a key. However, it is using the random.ints() method, which generates a stream of pseudo-random integers. This is not a suitable way to generate a cryptographic key as it lacks sufficient entropy and randomness.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure and cryptographically strong random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."
