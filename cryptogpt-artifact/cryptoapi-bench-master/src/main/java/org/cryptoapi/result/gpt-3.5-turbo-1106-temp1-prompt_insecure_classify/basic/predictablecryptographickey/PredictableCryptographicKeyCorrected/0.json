[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());", 
  "description": "The code uses random.ints() method to generate a default encryption key. The use of random.ints() does not provide sufficient randomness for generating a secure encryption key.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator such as SecureRandom to generate a random encryption key."}, 
 {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);", 
  "description": "The code truncates the encryption key to a fixed size of 16 bytes, which may result in inadequate encryption strength.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a key derivation function (e.g. PBKDF2) to generate a secure encryption key of appropriate length."}, 
 {"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\");", 
  "description": "The code explicitly selects the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING cipher algorithm without considering the possibility of more secure algorithms being available.", 
  "recommendation": "Always use the highest strength encryption algorithm available and ensure that the algorithm is appropriate for the specific use case."}]
