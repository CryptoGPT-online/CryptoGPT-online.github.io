        "description": "The Cipher is instantiated with ECB mode which is insecure. ECB mode does not use an Initialization Vector (IV). When dealing with multiple blocks of plain text, it can be attacked using statistical methods. If the same data is being encrypted multiple times (either in the same execution or across different executions), the resulting cipher text will be identical if the data length is a multiple of the block size.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure mode of operation like CBC or GCM. In case of CBC, it should be used with an Initialization Vector (IV). In case of GCM, an Initialization Vector (IV) and an Authentication Tag (AAD) are required."
