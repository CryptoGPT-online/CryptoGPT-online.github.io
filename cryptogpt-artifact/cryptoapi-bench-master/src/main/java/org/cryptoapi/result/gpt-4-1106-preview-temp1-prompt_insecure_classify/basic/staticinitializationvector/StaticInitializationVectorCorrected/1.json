        "vulnerable_code": "BigInteger i = BigInteger.valueOf(sr.nextInt());\nbyte [] bytes = i.toByteArray();",
        "description": "The use of 'nextInt()' for generating an IV may not provide a cryptographically strong random value, especially if the value is converted to a BigInteger and then to a byte array. This can result in an IV that is smaller than expected if the most significant bits are not set.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'nextInt()' with 'nextBytes(byte[] bytes)' where 'bytes' is a byte array of the correct size for the IV (16 bytes for AES)."
