"description": "The encryption algorithm used is AES, which is a symmetric-key block cipher. However, the key provided is a string, which is a vulnerable key type as it can be easily guessed or obtained by an attacker. Also, the key is being copied to another array without any checking, which can lead to key misuse and data breaches.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure key generation mechanism, such as SecureRandom, to generate a cryptographically secure key. Also, use a key derivation function, such as PBKDF2, to derive a secure key from the provided string. Additionally, check the length of the key and make sure it is not less than the recommended length for the encryption algorithm used."
