"vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom(new byte[]{seed})",
"description": "The above code creates a SecureRandom object with a single seed byte. This can result in predictable random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator. A single byte is not enough entropy to create a secure seed for a random number generator, and it is recommended to use a larger seed, such as a String or a byte array of at least 16 bytes.",
"recommendation": "Use a larger seed for the SecureRandom object, such as a String or a byte array of at least 16 bytes. This will increase the entropy of the random number generator and make it more secure against attacks."
