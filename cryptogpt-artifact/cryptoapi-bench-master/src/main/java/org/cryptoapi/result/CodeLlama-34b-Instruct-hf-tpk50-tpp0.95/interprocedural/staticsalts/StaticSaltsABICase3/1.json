"description": "The PBEParameterSpec constructor is using a weak key derivation function (PBKDF2) with a default iteration count of 1024, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger key derivation function with a higher iteration count, such as PBKDF2 with a iteration count of at least 10000, or use a more secure password-based key derivation function like Argon2."
