        "description": "The way of converting a stream of random integers to a string does not guarantee sufficient randomness for cryptographic operations. The defaultKey may not be random enough and can lead to predictable keys.",

        "description": "The key material is derived from a random integer converted to a string, which may not provide high entropy for AES keys. Additionally, truncating or padding the key without a proper key derivation function will not result in a cryptographically strong key.",

        "description": "While AES itself is not broken, using it with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding can lead to vulnerabilities such as padding oracle attacks if not used carefully. Moreover, the code does not specify an initialization vector (IV) for CBC mode, which should be random and unique for each encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use AES in GCM mode to provide both confidentiality and integrity, and ensure a secure, random IV is used for each encryption operation."
