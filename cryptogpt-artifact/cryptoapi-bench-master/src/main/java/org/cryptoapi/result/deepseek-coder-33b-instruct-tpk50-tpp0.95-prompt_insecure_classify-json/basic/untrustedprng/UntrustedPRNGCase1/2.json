        "vulnerable_code": "Random randomGenerator = new Random();\nint x = randomGenerator.nextInt();",
        "description": "The code uses a Random number generator with no seed. This may not provide a uniform distribution of values across the entire range of possible output values. This can potentially lead to deterministic sequences in some cases.",
        "recommendation": "For cryptographic purposes, a cryptographically secure random number generator (such as java.security.SecureRandom) should be used instead. If the use of a SecureRandom is not feasible, a specific seed (such as the current system time in milliseconds) should be provided to the Random constructor."
