 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "crypto.method1()",
"description": "The method uses AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm. It also uses a static default key, which makes it vulnerable to attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES/GCM/NoPadding. Also, generate a random key for each encryption instead of using a static default key."
}

{
"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_code": "keyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16)",
"description": "The method uses a fixed length of 16 bytes for the encryption key, which is not secure. An attacker can use this information to crack the encryption.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and random key for each encryption. Also, make sure the key is long enough to be secure."
