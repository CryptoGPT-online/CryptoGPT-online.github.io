"description": "The use of MD4 as a cryptographic hash algorithm is insecure. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions, which can be used to attack the system that uses the hash.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of MD4."
