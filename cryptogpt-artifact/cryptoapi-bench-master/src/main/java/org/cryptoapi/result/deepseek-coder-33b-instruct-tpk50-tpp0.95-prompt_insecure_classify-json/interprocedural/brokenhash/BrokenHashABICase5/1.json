    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(String.valueOf(crypto));",
    "description": "The code uses a static cryptographic algorithm which is not secure and can lead to vulnerabilities. The algorithm (SHA1) is considered to be weak and not secure for many applications.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a safe and secure cryptographic algorithm for your application. You can choose from a list of cryptographic algorithms provided by the Java Cryptography Architecture. If you have to use a less secure algorithm, make sure to choose one that is as strong as your data's protection requirements allow."
