 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "C4.encrypt(String str, String passedAlgo) method uses the algorithm passed in the passedAlgo parameter, which is not properly validated. If the user passes an algorithm that is not secure, the method will use it.",
"description": "The C4.encrypt(String str, String passedAlgo) method is vulnerable to the user passing a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm. The method uses the passed in algorithm to encrypt the string, without proper validation of the algorithm. This can lead to insecure encryption and potentially vulnerabilities in the system.",
"recommendation": "Implement proper validation of the passed in algorithm in the C4.encrypt(String str, String passedAlgo) method. Use a secure algorithm and make sure the key length is long enough. Also, avoid using MD2 or MD4 algorithm as they are considered broken and vulnerable."
