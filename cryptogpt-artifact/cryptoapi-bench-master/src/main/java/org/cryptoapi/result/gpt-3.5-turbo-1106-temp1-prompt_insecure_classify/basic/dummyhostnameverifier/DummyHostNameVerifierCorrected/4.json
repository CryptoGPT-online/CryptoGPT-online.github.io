[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "HostnameVerifier hv = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();\nreturn hv.verify(hostname, sslSession);",
"description": "The code is using the default HostnameVerifier to verify the hostname in the SSL certificate. This may lead to improper certificate validation as it does not perform any additional checks on the certificate.",
"recommendation": "Implement a custom HostnameVerifier that performs additional checks on the certificate, such as matching the hostname against a whitelist of trusted hosts."}]
