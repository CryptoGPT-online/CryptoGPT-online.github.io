  "description": "The PBEKeySpec is being initialized with a low iteration count (11010) which may result in weak derived keys, making the key easily guessable and susceptible to brute force attacks.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a higher iteration count to strengthen the key derivation function, such as 100,000 or more iterations."}]
