    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nString defaultKey = String.valueOf(random.ints());",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized without any seed, which makes the generated random values predictable and insecure. Using predictable random values can lead to attacks such as brute-force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong random number generator (RNG) that is properly seeded with a cryptographically secure source of randomness, such as `/dev/urandom` on Linux or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."

    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "int iterationCount = 11010;\nint keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The number of iterations (`iterationCount`) and the key length (`keyLength`) used for the key derivation are too low. This makes the key derivation process easier to brute-force and compromises the security of the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations and the key length to make the key derivation process more secure. For example, use at least 100,000 iterations and a key length of 256 bits."
