    "description": "The IV used for the AES Cipher is generated randomly each time the code is run. If the same IV is used for multiple encryption operations, an attacker can manipulate the encrypted data to reveal the key or the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "The IV should be generated securely using a cryptographic secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and should not be reused. Preferably, the IV should be created and transmitted by secure means with the encrypted data. If reusing the IV needs to be done, you should ensure that the key is also not reused."
