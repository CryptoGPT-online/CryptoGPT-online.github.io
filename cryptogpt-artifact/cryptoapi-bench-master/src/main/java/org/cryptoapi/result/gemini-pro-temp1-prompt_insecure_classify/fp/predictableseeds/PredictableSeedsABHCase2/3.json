    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] seed = {b, b};",
    "description": "Using a constant value as the seed for `SecureRandom` is insecure because it makes the generated random numbers predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`, and provide it with a sufficient amount of entropy, such as from a hardware random number generator or a strong pseudorandom number generator seeded with a secure random seed."
