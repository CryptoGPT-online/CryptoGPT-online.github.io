    "description": "MD4 is a cryptographic hash function that has been found to be insecure. It is not recommended to use it for any security-sensitive applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
  }
]
```

The code uses MD4 as the default cryptographic algorithm. MD4 is a broken algorithm and should not be used for any security-sensitive applications. An attacker can easily find collisions for MD4, which means they can create two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be used to bypass security measures that rely on MD4, such as digital signatures.
