[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_code": "int keyLength = 16;",
    "description": "The key length is set to 16 bytes, which is not sufficient for strong encryption. It is recommended to use a key length of at least 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the key length to at least 256 bits."

  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();\nsr.nextBytes(salt);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom object is not properly seeded, which could result in predictable salt values. It is recommended to seed the SecureRandom object with a strong source of randomness.",
    "recommendation": "Seed the SecureRandom object with a strong source of randomness, such as /dev/urandom on Linux systems."
