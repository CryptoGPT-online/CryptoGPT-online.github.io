  "vulnerable_code": "byte [] keyBytes = key.getBytes();\nkeyBytes = Arrays.copyOf(keyBytes,16);\nSecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");",
  "description": "The code is using the getBytes method to obtain a byte array from a string, and then simply padding the array to 16 bytes. This approach might lead to weak or predictable keys, increasing the vulnerability to brute force attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure key generation method such as a KeyGenerator or SecureRandom to generate the AES key. Additionally, considering using a key derivation function like PBKDF2 for more security."}]
