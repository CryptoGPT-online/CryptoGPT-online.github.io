        "vulnerable_code": "PBEParameterSpec(salt, iteration)",
        "description": "The salt and iteration count used in the PBEParameterSpec constructor are not secure. The salt is only 32 bytes long, which is not enough to be considered truly random. Additionally, the iteration count is not set to a high enough value to make the algorithm slow and resistant to brute force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure salt and iteration count. The salt should be at least 64 bytes long and the iteration count should be at least 100,000."
