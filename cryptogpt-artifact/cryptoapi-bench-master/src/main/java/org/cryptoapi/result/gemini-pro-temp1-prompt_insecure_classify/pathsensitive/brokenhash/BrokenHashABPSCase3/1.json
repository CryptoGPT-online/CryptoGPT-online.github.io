    "description": "MD4 is a cryptographic hash function that is considered broken and should not be used for security purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the use of MD4 with a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
