[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "sr.nextBytes(bytes);", "description": "The SecureRandom object is used to generate random bytes for the initialization vector (IV), but the bytes are only generated if the 'choice' variable is greater than 1. This means that if 'choice' is 1 or less, a fixed IV of 'abcde' will be used which is not secure.", "recommendation": "Generate a random IV for all cases, regardless of the value of 'choice'."}]
