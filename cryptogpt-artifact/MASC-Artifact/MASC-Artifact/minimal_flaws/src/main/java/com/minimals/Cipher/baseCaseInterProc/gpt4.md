Analyzing the provided code, here are the concerns:

Use of DES:
The code contains a method (methodB()) that sets the cipherName to "DES". DES (Data Encryption Standard) is an outdated encryption algorithm that's considered insecure due to its small key size. This makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks. In the main method, you chain methodA() and methodB(), which means cipherName gets set to "AES/GCM/NoPadding" first, but then immediately gets overwritten to "DES".

Chained Methods Can Lead to Ambiguity:
The chaining of methodA().methodB() can be confusing to developers reading the code. At first glance, one might assume that the AES algorithm is being used, especially if they are not reading every line or not familiar with the order of execution in method chaining. This ambiguity can lead to accidental misuse.

Static Mode and Padding Specification:
The cipherName for the AES algorithm in methodA() specifies the mode (GCM) and padding (NoPadding). While GCM is a secure choice as it provides both confidentiality and authentication, if any changes or extensions are made to the class, there's a risk that someone might misuse the API.

Recommendations:

Avoid using DES altogether. If the intention is symmetric encryption, stick to AES, and use a mode that provides both encryption and authentication (like GCM or CCM).

Consider simplifying the class design to avoid method chaining that alters a critical configuration. Each method should ideally have a single, clear responsibility.

Ensure that, when using AES in GCM mode, you manage and use the associated nonce (Number Once) correctly. Each nonce and key combination should be unique for every encryption operation. This is not shown in the code, but it's a critical consideration when using GCM mode in practice.
