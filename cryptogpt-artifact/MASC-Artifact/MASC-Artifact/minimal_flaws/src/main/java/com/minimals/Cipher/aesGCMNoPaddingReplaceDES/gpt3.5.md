The provided code appears to have a significant issue related to cryptographic security. In the code, you are dynamically modifying the encryption algorithm string from "AES/GCM/NoPadding" to "DES" using the replace method. This action is insecure and can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

Here's why this is problematic:

Algorithm Substitution: By dynamically changing the algorithm to "DES," you are essentially requesting the use of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which is considered insecure and obsolete due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Using DES for encryption is not recommended for any security-sensitive applications.

Misleading Code: Such code can be misleading to other developers or code reviewers, making it unclear about the actual encryption algorithm being used. It's always best practice to use the algorithm names explicitly and avoid dynamically altering them.

Security Implications: Using an insecure encryption algorithm like DES can compromise the security of your data, as it can be relatively easy for attackers to decrypt data encrypted with DES.

In summary, dynamically changing the encryption algorithm in this manner is a security risk and should be avoided. Always use well-established and secure encryption algorithms explicitly in your code.
