        "description": "The code is using a broken crypto algorithm, specifically the DES cipher, which is no longer considered secure. DES is a 56-bit cipher, which means it can be easily brute-forced. The code is also using the default padding, which may not be secure for some use cases. It is recommended to use a more secure cipher, such as AES, and a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS#7.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher, such as AES, and a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS#7. Additionally, consider using a more secure key derivation function, such as PBKDF2, to derive the key from the password."
