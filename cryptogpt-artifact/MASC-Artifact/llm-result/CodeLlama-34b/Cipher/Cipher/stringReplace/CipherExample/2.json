"description": "The `Cipher.getInstance` method is used with a broken algorithm name. The `$` character is a special character in Java, and it is used to escape other special characters. In this case, the algorithm name is \"DE$S\", which is a broken algorithm. The `replace` method is used to remove the `$` character, but it does not actually change the algorithm name.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm name instead of \"DE$S\"."
