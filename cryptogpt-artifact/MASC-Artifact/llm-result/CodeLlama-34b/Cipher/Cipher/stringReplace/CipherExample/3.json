"description": "The cipher algorithm \"DE$S\" is not a secure algorithm, it is an outdated and weak algorithm that should not be used in production. The use of this algorithm can lead to security vulnerabilities and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date cipher algorithm, such as AES or ChaCha20, instead of \"DE$S\"."
