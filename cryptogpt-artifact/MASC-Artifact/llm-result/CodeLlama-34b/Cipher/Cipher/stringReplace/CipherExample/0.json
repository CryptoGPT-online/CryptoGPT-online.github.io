{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DE$S\")",
"description": "The code uses the DES cryptographic algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for encrypting sensitive data.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of DES with a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm, such as AES."
},
{
"misuse": "Insecure Cipher Modes",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/NoPadding\")",
"description": "The code uses the ECB cipher mode, which is not secure for encrypting sensitive data. ECB mode can leak information about the data being encrypted.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of ECB mode with a more secure cipher mode, such as CBC or GCM."
},

"misuse": "Insecure Key Management",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/ECB/NoPadding\")",
"description": "The code does not properly manage the keys used for encryption and decryption. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as key disclosure and brute-force attacks.",
"recommendation": "Implement proper key management, such as using a secure key storage solution and generating new keys for each encryption operation."
