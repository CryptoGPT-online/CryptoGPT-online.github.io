        "description": "The use of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for new systems. It has been shown to be vulnerable to various attacks, such as brute force attacks and meet-in-the-middle attacks. The use of AES is recommended instead.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of the DES algorithm with AES, and consider using a secure mode of operation such as GCM or EAX to ensure the authenticity and confidentiality of the data."
