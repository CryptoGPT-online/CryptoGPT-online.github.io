"description": "The code uses a broken crypto algorithm, \"AES\".replace(\"A\", \"D\"), which is a well-known broken cipher and should not be used in any security context. This algorithm is vulnerable to various attacks, including brute force and known-plaintext attacks, and should be immediately replaced with a secure algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Replace the broken algorithm with a secure algorithm such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305."
