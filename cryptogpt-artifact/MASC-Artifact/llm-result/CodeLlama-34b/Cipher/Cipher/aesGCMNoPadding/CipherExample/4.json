"description": "The code uses the AES/GCM/NoPadding transformation, which is a deprecated and insecure algorithm. GCM is a block cipher mode that is not authenticated, and it does not provide any integrity checks. This can lead to attacks such as padding oracle attacks, which can allow an attacker to decrypt the data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and authenticated encryption algorithm, such as AES/GCM/PKCS5Padding or AES/CTR/NoPadding."

"misuse": "Insecure Cipher Instantiation",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\")",
"description": "The code uses the Cipher.getInstance() method to create a new Cipher instance without specifying a provider. This can lead to the use of an insecure or deprecated provider, which can weaken the encryption security.",
"recommendation": "Use the Cipher.getInstance() method and specify a secure and up-to-date provider, such as the SunJCE or the Bouncy Castle provider."
