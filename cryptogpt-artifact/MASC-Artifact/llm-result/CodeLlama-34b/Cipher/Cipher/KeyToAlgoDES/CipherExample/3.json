This code has a security issue related to CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). The `DES` algorithm is considered broken and should not be used. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as `AES`.

The `Cipher.getInstance()` method takes a string that specifies the algorithm to use, and in this case, it is being passed the `keygen.getAlgorithm()` method which returns a string that represents the algorithm used for the key generation. However, this method returns the algorithm name in lowercase, and the `Cipher.getInstance()` method expects the algorithm name in uppercase. Therefore, the `Cipher.getInstance()` method is not able to find the correct algorithm and will use a default algorithm, which in this case is the broken `DES` algorithm.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a more secure algorithm such as `AES`. The `Cipher.getInstance()` method should be called with the correct algorithm name in uppercase, for example: `Cipher.getInstance("AES")`. Additionally, the `SecretKey` object should be generated using a secure algorithm such as `AES` as well.
