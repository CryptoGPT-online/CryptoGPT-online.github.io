    "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\")",
    "description": "The `Cipher.getInstance()` method is used to obtain an instance of a cryptographic algorithm, but the algorithm name is not explicitly specified. This can lead to the use of weak or broken cryptographic algorithms, which can be vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure and widely accepted cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR, with a strong key size. Avoid using any algorithm with a key size less than 128 bits, as these are considered to be insecure."
