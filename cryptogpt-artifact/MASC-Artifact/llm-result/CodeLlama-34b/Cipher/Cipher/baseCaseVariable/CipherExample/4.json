        "description": "The code uses a hardcoded crypto algorithm, which can be vulnerable to attacks that exploit weaknesses in the algorithm. It is recommended to use a secure random algorithm instead.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random algorithm, such as AES, and make sure to handle the algorithm name in a secure way."
