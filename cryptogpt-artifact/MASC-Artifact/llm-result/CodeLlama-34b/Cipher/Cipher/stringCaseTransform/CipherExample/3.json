"description": "The use of the DES encryption algorithm is insecure because it uses a relatively small key size (56 bits) and is vulnerable to brute force attacks. It is recommended to use AES encryption algorithm instead.",
"recommendation": "Use AES encryption algorithm with a larger key size (128 bits or larger) and consider using a secure mode of operation such as GCM or CBC."
