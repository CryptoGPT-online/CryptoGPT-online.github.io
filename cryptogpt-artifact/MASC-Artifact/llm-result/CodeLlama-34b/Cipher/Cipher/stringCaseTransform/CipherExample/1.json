        "description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used. DES is a 56-bit block cipher, which means it has a small key space and can be brute-forced easily. It is also vulnerable to attacks such as meet-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a sufficient key size (at least 128-bit)."
