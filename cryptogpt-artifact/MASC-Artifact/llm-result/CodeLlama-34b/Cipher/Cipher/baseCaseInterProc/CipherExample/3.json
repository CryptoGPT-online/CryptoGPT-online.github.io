[
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "methodA(), methodB()",
"description": "The methods methodA() and methodB() use the 'AES/GCM/NoPadding' and 'DES' algorithms respectively, which are broken and should not be used. The 'AES/GCM/NoPadding' algorithm is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, while the 'DES' algorithm is vulnerable to brute force attacks. ",
"recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm such as AES in GCM mode with a secure padding scheme such as PKCS#7. Avoid using broken algorithms such as DES."
