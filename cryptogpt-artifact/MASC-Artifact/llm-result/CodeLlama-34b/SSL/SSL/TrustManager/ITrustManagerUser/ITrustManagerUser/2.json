        "description": "The code uses the `ITrustManager` interface to implement a custom trust manager, which is not a secure way of verifying the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates. The `ITrustManager` interface does not provide any mechanism for verifying the authenticity of certificates, and it can be easily bypassed by an attacker who can provide a fake certificate. The recommended solution is to use a secure trust manager, such as the `javax.net.ssl.TrustManager` class, which provides a mechanism for verifying the authenticity of certificates using the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) cryptographic architecture.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the `ITrustManager` interface with the `javax.net.ssl.TrustManager` class, and implement a secure trust manager that verifies the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates using the JSSE cryptographic architecture."
