[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Insecure Implementation of Password Storage",
    "vulnerable_code": "getAcceptedIssuers()",
    "description": "The getAcceptedIssuers() method returns an empty array, which indicates that the trust manager accepts any certificate issued by any CA. This is a vulnerability because it allows an attacker to use a self-signed certificate to impersonate the server, potentially leading to a successful man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "recommendation": "Update the getAcceptedIssuers() method to return an array of trusted certificate issuers."
  }
