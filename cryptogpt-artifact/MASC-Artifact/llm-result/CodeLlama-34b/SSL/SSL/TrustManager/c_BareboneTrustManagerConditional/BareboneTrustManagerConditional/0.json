"description": "The X509TrustManager interface is a part of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) and is used to verify the trustworthiness of X.509 certificates. However, the BareboneTrustManagerExt class does not implement any of the methods of the X509TrustManager interface, which makes it ineffective in verifying the trustworthiness of certificates.",

"description": "The checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods of the BareboneTrustManagerExt class are not implemented properly. These methods should throw a CertificateException if the certificate is not trusted. However, in the current implementation, these methods do not throw a CertificateException, which makes them vulnerable to attack.",

This method should return an array of X509Certificate objects that represent the trusted issuers. However, in the current implementation, it returns an empty array, which makes it vulnerable to attack.",
