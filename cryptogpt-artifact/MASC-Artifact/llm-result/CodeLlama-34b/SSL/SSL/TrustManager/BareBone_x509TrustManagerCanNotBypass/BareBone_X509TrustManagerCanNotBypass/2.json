        "description": "The code uses a custom implementation of X509TrustManager, which is a deprecated and insecure interface. This interface is vulnerable to various attacks, including bypassing the certificate validation process, and can be used to impersonate the server or steal sensitive information.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure and up-to-date cryptography library, such as the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), and follow industry best practices for certificate validation."
