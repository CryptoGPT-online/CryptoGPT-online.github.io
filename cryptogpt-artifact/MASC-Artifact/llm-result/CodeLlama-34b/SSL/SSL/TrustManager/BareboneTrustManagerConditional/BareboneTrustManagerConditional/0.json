 The provided code has the following security issues related to crypto API:

* Misuse of the `checkServerTrusted` and `checkClientTrusted` methods: The code checks the `AuthType` parameter of these methods for the value "RSA", which is not a secure approach. The `AuthType` parameter is not always present or accurate, and it should not be used to determine whether a certificate is trusted.
* Missing Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking: The code does not check for certificate revocation, which can allow for the use of revoked certificates.
* Insecure use of `X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers()`: The code uses an empty array to store the accepted issuers, which means that it will accept any certificate regardless of its issuer. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Recommendations for fixing these issues:

* Use secure mechanisms to determine whether a certificate is trusted, such as checking the certificate's signature or using an established trust store.
* Implement CRL checking to ensure that revoked certificates are not used.
* Use a more secure approach to storing and retrieving certificates, such as using a trust store that contains a list of trusted issuers.
