 {"misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch", "vulnerable_code": "checkServerTrusted method", "description": "The code ignores the server's certificate and only checks if the AuthType is RSA. This can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker can present a forged certificate with the correct AuthType and the code will accept it.", "recommendation": "Additional validation should be performed to ensure that the server's certificate matches the expected host and is not expired."}
