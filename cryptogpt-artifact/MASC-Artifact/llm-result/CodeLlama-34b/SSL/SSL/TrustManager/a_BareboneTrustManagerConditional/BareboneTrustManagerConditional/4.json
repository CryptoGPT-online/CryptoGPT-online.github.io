 I found two security issues in the code:

1. CWE-256: Insecure Use of Crypto API (Broken Crypto Algorithm)

The code uses the "TLS" protocol, which is a broken cryptographic algorithm that is vulnerable to the Logjam attack. The "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256" algorithm is preferred as a replacement for "TLS" because it is more secure.

2. CWE-297: Insecure Temporary File Usage

The code creates a temporary file in the "C:" drive, which is a security issue because it creates a temporary file in a public directory. The file should be created in a secure location, such as the application's data directory, to prevent unauthorized access.
