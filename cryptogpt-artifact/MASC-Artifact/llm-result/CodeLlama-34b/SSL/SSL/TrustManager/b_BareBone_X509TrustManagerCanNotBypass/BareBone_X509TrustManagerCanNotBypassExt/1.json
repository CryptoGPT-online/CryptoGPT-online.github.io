In the code provided, there are several security issues:

* The function `checkClientTrusted()` uses a broken crypto algorithm, specifically MD5, to verify the client's certificate. This is vulnerable to various attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks.
* The function `checkServerTrusted()` uses the X509TrustManager interface to check the server's certificate, which is vulnerable to various attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks.
* The function `getAcceptedIssuers()` returns a list of accepted issuers, which is vulnerable to various attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks.

To fix these issues, it is recommended to use more secure ways to check the client's and server's certificates, such as using the SSL/TLS protocol and a trusted certificate authority. Additionally, it is recommended to use a more secure way to get the accepted issuers, such as using a secure protocol and a trusted certificate authority.
