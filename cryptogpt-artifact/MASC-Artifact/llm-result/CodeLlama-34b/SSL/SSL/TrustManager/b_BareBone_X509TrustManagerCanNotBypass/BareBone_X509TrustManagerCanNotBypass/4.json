        "description": "The `BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass` class is using the `X509TrustManager` interface, which is a known broken crypto API. The `X509TrustManager` interface is designed to work with a specific set of certificates, but it does not properly handle certificate revocation or expiration. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure crypto API, such as the `javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager` interface, which provides a more robust set of features for certificate management."
