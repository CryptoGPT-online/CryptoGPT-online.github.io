 Here is the output of the security audit for the code:

[
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "X509Certificate[]",
"description": "The code uses a deprecated certificate class, which may be vulnerable to various attacks, such as certificate forgery or man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Update the code to use the latest certificate class and ensure that all certificates are properly validated and secured."
},
{
"misuse": "Insufficient Input Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "String authType",
"description": "The code does not properly validate user input, which may allow an attacker to manipulate the authentication type used for certificate validation.",
"recommendation": "Add input validation to ensure that the user input is properly sanitized and validated."
},
{
"misuse": "Insecure Communication",
"vulnerable_code": "Socket socket",
"description": "The code uses a plain socket connection, which may allow an attacker to intercept and manipulate the communication.
"recommendation": "Update the code to use a secure socket connection, such as TLS/SSL, to protect the communication from interception and manipulation."
},
{
"misuse": "Insufficient Encryption Strength",
"vulnerable_code": "SSLEngine engine",
"description": "The code uses a weak encryption algorithm, which may be vulnerable to brute force attacks.
"recommendation": "Update the code to use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES-256, to improve the encryption strength."
}
]

Note that the audit report only identifies potential security vulnerabilities and does not guarantee that the code is secure. It is important to thoroughly test and review the code to ensure that it meets the required security standards.
