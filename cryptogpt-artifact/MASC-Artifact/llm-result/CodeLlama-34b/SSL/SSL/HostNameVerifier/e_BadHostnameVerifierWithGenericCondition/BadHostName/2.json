[
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){ return true; }",
"description": "The code checks if the session is null and returns true if it is, but it also returns true if the condition is not met. This can lead to a vulnerability where a man-in-the-middle attacker can bypass the hostname verification.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure hostname verification mechanism, such as comparing the hostname against a known list of trusted hostnames, or using a certificate pinning mechanism to ensure that the certificate is valid and trusted."
