"description": "The length of the cipher suite is being checked for being greater than or equal to 0. This is a security misuse as the length of the cipher suite should not be used for security purposes.",
"recommendation": "Change the condition to use a secure algorithm for checking the cipher suite, such as comparing the cipher suite to a known secure algorithm."

"vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}",
"description": "The HostNameVerifier is being implemented in an insecure way, as it is not properly verifying the hostname. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure implementation of the HostNameVerifier, such as one that properly verifies the hostname and uses a secure algorithm for checking the cipher suite."
