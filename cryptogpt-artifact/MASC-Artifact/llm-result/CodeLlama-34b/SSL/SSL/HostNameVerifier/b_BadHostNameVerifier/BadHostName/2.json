    "description": "The code implements a HostnameVerifier interface, which is responsible for verifying the hostname of a TLS/SSL server. However, the code always returns true, which means it trusts any hostname without verifying it. This is a security issue because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of always returning true, the code should verify the hostname using a proper algorithm, such as using the `javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier` class or a third-party library."
  }
]

In this code, the `HostnameVerifier` interface is implemented, which is responsible for verifying the hostname of a TLS/SSL server. However, the code always returns true, which means it trusts any hostname without verifying it. This is a security issue because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.

To fix this misuse, the code should verify the hostname using a proper algorithm, such as using the `javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier` class or a third-party library.
