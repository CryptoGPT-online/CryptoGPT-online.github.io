 Here is the JSON format output:

[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Unsafe Use of Crypto API",
    "vulnerable_code": "return true;",
    "description": "The SSLSession class is used to provide a SSL/TLS session, but it is not being used in a secure manner. The `verify` method always returns true, which means that any hostname is considered valid. This is a potential security vulnerability, as it allows attackers to intercept and manipulate communication between the client and server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure crypto API, such as the `JSSE` library, to perform SSL/TLS handshakes and hostname verification. Additionally, use a secure method for generating hostname verification policies, such as using a `HostnameVerifier` that checks against a known list of valid hostnames."
