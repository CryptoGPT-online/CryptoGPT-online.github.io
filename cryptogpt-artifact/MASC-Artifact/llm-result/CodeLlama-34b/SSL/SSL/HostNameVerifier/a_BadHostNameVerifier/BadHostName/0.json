            @Override

            }
        }",
    "description": "This code implements a HostnameVerifier interface and overrides the verify method. The verify method is used to verify the hostname of the SSL/TLS certificate. However, the implementation always returns true, which means that the hostname is not verified and the certificate is trusted unconditionally. This is a broken crypto algorithm and can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "The verify method should be implemented correctly to check the hostname of the SSL/TLS certificate and ensure that it matches the expected hostname. The certificate should also be verified using a trusted Certificate Authority."
