 Here is the JSON format output:

{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "return true;",
"description": "The code always returns true, which means it always accepts any hostname, which is a security vulnerability. A proper hostname verification should be implemented to ensure that the connection is established with the intended host.",
"recommendation": "Implement a proper hostname verification mechanism, such as using a whitelist of trusted hostnames or using a secure certificate pinning mechanism."
