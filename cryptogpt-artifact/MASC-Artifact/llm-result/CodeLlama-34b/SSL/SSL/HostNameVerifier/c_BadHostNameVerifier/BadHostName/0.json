    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "return true",
    "description": "The code always returns true, which means it will accept any certificate, even if it's not valid. This is a vulnerability because it allows for man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept the connection and present a fake certificate as if it were from the real server.",
    "recommendation": "The correct way to implement this is to use a trusted certificate authority (CA) to verify the certificate's authenticity. This can be done using the SSLContext class in Java, which provides a built-in trust store that contains a list of trusted CAs."

    "description": "The code specifies an insecure cipher suite, which is vulnerable to various attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. The cipher suite should be changed to a more secure one, such as TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.",
    "recommendation": "The correct way to implement this is to use a secure cipher suite that is resistant to various attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. The cipher suite should be chosen based on the requirements of the application and the capabilities of the platform."
