        "description": "The HostNameVerifier class is vulnerable to a misuse of the Crypto API, specifically the use of the SSLSession.getPeerCertificates() method to verify the hostname of the server. This method is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, as it does not verify the validity of the certificate chain. An attacker could potentially intercept the connection and present a fake certificate, allowing them to access the encrypted data.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure method to verify the hostname of the server, such as the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) API. This API provides a more secure way to verify the hostname of the server, such as using the X509TrustManager interface."
