 Here is the output in the requested bare JSON format:

[
  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"md5\"))",
    "description": "The code uses the MessageDigest class to get an instance of the SHA-256 algorithm, but it replaces the algorithm name with \"md5\", which is a broken cryptographic hash function. Using a broken cryptographic hash function can result in vulnerabilities such as collision attacks, which can allow attackers to manipulate the data being hashed.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 instead of a broken one like MD5."
  }
