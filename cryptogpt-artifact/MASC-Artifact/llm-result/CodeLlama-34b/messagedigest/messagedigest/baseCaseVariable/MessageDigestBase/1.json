 {"misuses": [{"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(algorithmName)", "description": "The code uses the MD5 hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for secure applications. It is vulnerable to collisions and can be used to create hash collisions.","recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-384."}]}
