        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName())",
        "description": "The code uses the `MessageDigest.getInstance` method with a user-provided algorithm name, which can be vulnerable to a collision attack. The `MessageDigestComplex` class allows an attacker to switch the algorithm from SHA-256 to MD5, which is a broken algorithm and can be exploited.",
        "recommendation": "Use a whitelist of allowed algorithms and validate the user-provided algorithm name before passing it to `MessageDigest.getInstance`. Additionally, avoid using broken algorithms like MD5."
