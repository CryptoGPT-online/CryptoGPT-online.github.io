"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD$5".replace("$", ""));",
"description": "The code uses the MessageDigest class to create a cryptographic hash using the MD5 algorithm, which is a broken algorithm and should not be used for any purpose. The vulnerability is that the code uses a deprecated algorithm that is easily broken, and it does not provide any protection against attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead."
