"description": "The use of the MD5 hash algorithm is insecure because it has been proven to be vulnerable to collisions. This can lead to potential security issues, such as authenticity of the message being tampered with.",
"recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512."
