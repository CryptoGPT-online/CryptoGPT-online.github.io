"description": "The use of the md5 hash function is considered broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purpose. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be used to create hash collisions.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of md5."

"description": "The MessageDigest class is an abstract class that provides the basic functionality for a message digest algorithm. The getAlgorithm() method returns the name of the algorithm, but it does not specify the version or implementation of the algorithm. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if the implementation is not secure.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure implementation of the MessageDigest class, such as the SHA-256 or SHA-512 algorithm, and specify the version and implementation when instantiating the object."
