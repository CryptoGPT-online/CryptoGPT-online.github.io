 The code uses the MD5 hash function, which is not considered secure anymore. Here's the JSON output:

[
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"md5\")",
"description": "The MD5 hash function is considered broken and should not be used for secure applications. It has been vulnerable to collision attacks, which can lead to the creation of false certificates or other types of attacks.",
"recommendation": "Switch to a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
