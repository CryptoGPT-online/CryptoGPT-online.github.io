 The provided code has a crypto API misuse in the line `cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256".replace("SHA-256", "MD5"));`. This line of code is using the `replace` method to replace the string "SHA-256" with "MD5", which is a broken crypto algorithm. The `getMessageDigest` method is then called with the replaced string, which results in the creation of a MessageDigest object using the MD5 algorithm.

This misuse can be fixed by using the correct algorithm name in the `getInstance` method call, for example, `cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");`. Additionally, it's recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-3 or SHA-512 instead of MD5.
