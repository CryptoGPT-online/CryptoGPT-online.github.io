 Here is the JSON format report:
[
{
"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"MD5\"))",
"description": "The code uses the SHA-256 algorithm to create a MessageDigest object, but then replaces it with MD5. This can lead to a broken cryptographic algorithm, which can compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and widely-used cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, and avoid using weak or broken algorithms like MD5."
},
{
"misuse": "Cryptographic Key Management",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"MD5\"))",
"description": "The code uses a cryptographic algorithm, but does not properly manage the cryptographic keys used by the algorithm. This can lead to weaknesses in the encryption and potential vulnerabilities in the system.",
"recommendation": "Properly manage the cryptographic keys used by the algorithm, including key generation, storage, and rotation."
