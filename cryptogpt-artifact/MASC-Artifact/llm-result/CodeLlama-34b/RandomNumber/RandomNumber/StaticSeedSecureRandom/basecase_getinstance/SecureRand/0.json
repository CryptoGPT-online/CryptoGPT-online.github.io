  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Random Number Generation",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\")",
    "description": "The code uses the `SecureRandom` class with the `NativePRNG` algorithm, which is not cryptographically secure. The `NativePRNG` algorithm uses the operating system's entropy source, which may not be sufficient to generate truly random numbers. This can lead to predictable behavior and potential attacks, such as ciphertext-only attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generation algorithm, such as `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")` or `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"DRBG\")`."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Insecure Seed",
    "vulnerable_code": "seedBytes.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)",
    "description": "The code uses the `getBytes` method to convert a string into a byte array, which may not be secure. The `getBytes` method uses the platform's default character encoding, which may not be consistent across all platforms. This can lead to potential attacks, such as side-channel attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure method to convert a string into a byte array, such as `StandardCharsets.UTF_8.encode(seedBytes)`."
