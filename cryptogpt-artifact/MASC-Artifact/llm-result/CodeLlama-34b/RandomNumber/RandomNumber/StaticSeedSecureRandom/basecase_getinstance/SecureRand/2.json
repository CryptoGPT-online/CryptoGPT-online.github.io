"description": "Using NativePRNG as the secure random number generator is not recommended. NativePRNG is an insecure PRNG that uses the system's default random number generator, which can be vulnerable to attack. Instead, use a secure random number generator that uses a cryptographically secure PRNG, such as SHA1PRNG.",
"recommendation": "Replace the insecure NativePRNG with a secure random number generator, such as SHA1PRNG."
