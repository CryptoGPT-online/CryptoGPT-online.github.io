"misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\")",
"description": "The NativePRNG algorithm is considered broken and should not be used. It is a pseudorandom number generator that uses the system clock as a seed, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. This can lead to predictable random numbers being generated, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator, such as /dev/urandom or a cryptographic-quality random number generator, instead of NativePRNG. Additionally, avoid using the system clock as a seed, as it can be easily guessed by an attacker."
