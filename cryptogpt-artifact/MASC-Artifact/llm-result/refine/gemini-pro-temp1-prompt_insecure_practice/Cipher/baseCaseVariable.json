### False Positive Misuses
1. **Misuse**: Weak Cryptographic Algorithm
**Code**: `String algorithmName = "AES";
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(algorithmName);`
**Reason**: This misuse is a false positive. The code snippet uses the `AES` algorithm, which is not considered weak for most use cases. AES is still widely used and recommended by NIST for protecting sensitive data.

2. **Misuse**: Broken Crypto Algorithm
**Code**: `Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(algorithmName);`
**Reason**: This misuse is also a false positive. The code snippet does specify the encryption algorithm to use when creating the `Cipher` object. The `algorithmName` variable is used to specify the algorithm, and it is set to `"AES"` in the code.
