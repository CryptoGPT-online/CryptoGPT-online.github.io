### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse:** Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)
**Vulnerable Code:** Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(keygen.getAlgorithm());
**Description:** The code uses the `keygen.getAlgorithm()` to get the algorithm for creating the cipher, which is not secure because the algorithm can be tampered with before the cipher is created.
**Recommendation:** Use a constant or a secure source to specify the algorithm for the cipher.

**Explanation:** This misuse is a false positive because the code is using `KeyGenerator` to generate a key for the cipher, which is a secure way to generate a key. The algorithm used to generate the key is not relevant to the security of the cipher, as the key itself is what is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.

2. **Misuse:** Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327)
**Vulnerable Code:** // Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(key.getAlgorithm().toUpperCase());
**Description:** The code uses the `key.getAlgorithm().toUpperCase()` to get the algorithm for creating the cipher, which is not secure because the algorithm can be tampered with before the cipher is created.
**Recommendation:** Use a constant or a secure source to specify the algorithm for the cipher.

**Explanation:** This misuse is also a false positive for the same reason as the previous misuse. The code is using `KeyGenerator` to generate a key for the cipher, so the algorithm used to generate the key is not relevant to the security of the cipher.
