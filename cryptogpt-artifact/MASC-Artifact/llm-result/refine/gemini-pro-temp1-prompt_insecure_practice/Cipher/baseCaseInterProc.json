### False Positive Misuse ###
1.  "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm (CWE-326)",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(new CipherExample().methodA().methodB().getCipherName());",
    "description": "The code dynamically sets the cipher algorithm name, which could allow an attacker to specify a weak or insecure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a hardcoded, strong cipher algorithm instead of dynamically setting it."

**Explanation**: This misuse is a false positive because the code is using a secure cipher algorithm, AES/GCM/NoPadding. Even though the cipher name is set dynamically, the value is fixed to AES/GCM/NoPadding in the methodA() method. An attacker cannot change the cipher name to a weak algorithm because the methodB() method overwrites the cipher name with the fixed value of "DES".
