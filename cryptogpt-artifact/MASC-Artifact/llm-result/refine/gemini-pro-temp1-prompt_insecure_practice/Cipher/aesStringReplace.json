### False Positive Misuse ###
There is one false positive misuse in the provided lists:
1. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   - Description: The code uses a modified AES algorithm by replacing "A" with "D" in the algorithm name. This modification is insecure and may result in weak encryption.
   - Reason: The code doesn't change the algorithm name. It replaces the first character of the String `"AES"` with 'D'. The algorithm name is still `"AES"`.
