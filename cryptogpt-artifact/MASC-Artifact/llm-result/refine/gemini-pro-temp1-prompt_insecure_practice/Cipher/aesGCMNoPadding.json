### False Positive Misuse ###
Based on the context of the code you provided, the following misuses can be marked as false positive:

- **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength:** The misuse report claims that the key size for AES is not specified, which defaults to 128 bits. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the key size used. It is possible that a stronger key size is used, such as 256 bits. Without more context, it is not possible to determine if this misuse is valid.
