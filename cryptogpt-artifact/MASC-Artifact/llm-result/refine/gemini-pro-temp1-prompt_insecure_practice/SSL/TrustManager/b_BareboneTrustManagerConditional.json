### False Positive Misuse ###

**1. CWE-256: Plaintext Storage**
>* Vulnerable code: `new SecureRandom()`
>* Description: The key is generated with SecureRandom without a source of entropy is insecure, the generated key may be weak.
>* Recommendation: Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom with a good source of entropy, or a hardware-based random number generator.

This misuse is a **false positive**. `SecureRandom` is initialized without an entropy source, which makes the generated key unpredictable. It is not plaintext storage.

**2. CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Key**
>* Vulnerable code: `context.init(null, trustAll, new SecureRandom());`
>* Description: The SSLContext is initialized with a weak key, which can be easily broken.
>* Recommendation: Use a strong key, such as a 2048-bit RSA key.

This misuse is a **false positive**. The key strength is not specified in the code. It is possible that a strong key is used, which makes this misuse not applicable.
