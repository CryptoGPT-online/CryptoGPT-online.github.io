### False Positive Misuses ###
1. **CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation**
   - **Reported Code:** `SSLContext.getInstance("SSL")`
   - **Reason:** This report is a false positive because the code is using the `SSL` protocol string to initialize the SSLContext, which is not the same as using the SSLv3 protocol. SSLv3 is an insecure protocol that should not be used, but the `SSL` protocol string can be used to initialize SSLContext with a more secure protocol, such as TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.

2. **CWE-297: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**
   - **Reported Code:** `SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");`
   - **Reason:** This report is a false positive because the code is using the `SSL` protocol string to initialize the SSLContext, which is not the same as using the SSLv3 protocol. SSLv3 is an insecure protocol that should not be used, but the `SSL` protocol string can be used to initialize SSLContext with a more secure protocol, such as TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.
