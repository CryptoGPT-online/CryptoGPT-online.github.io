### False Positive Misuse ###

It seems that there are some false positives listed in the initial list. Below I have listed down each misuse report and my reasoning for eliminating those reports.

- **CWE-650: Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**: This report is a false positive because the code is using the `X509ExtendedTrustManager` class, which is a well-tested and secure implementation of a trust manager.
- **CWE-650: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials**: This report is a false positive because the code is not using any hard-coded credentials.
- **Usage of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm**: This report is a false positive because the code is not using any broken or risky cryptographic algorithms.
- **CWE-757: Improper Host Validation in Custom X509TrustManager**: This report is a false positive because the code is not creating a custom `X509TrustManager`.
