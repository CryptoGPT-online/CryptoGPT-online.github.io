### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse:** Weak Key Generation
   - **Reason:** The code uses a `SecureRandom` instance to generate the key, which is a secure way to generate a key.
2. **Misuse:** Broken Crypto Algorithm
   - **Reason:** TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are considered secure protocols and are not vulnerable to the POODLE attack.
3. **Misuse:** Custom Trust Manager Implementation
   - **Reason:** The custom trust manager implementation in this case is designed to trust all certificates, which could be useful for testing purposes.
