### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**
   - Vulnerable Code: `"context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");"`
   - Reason: TLS is still widely used and considered secure for most applications. While TLS 1.2 or 1.3 are preferred, TLS 1.0 can still be used in certain legacy systems.
