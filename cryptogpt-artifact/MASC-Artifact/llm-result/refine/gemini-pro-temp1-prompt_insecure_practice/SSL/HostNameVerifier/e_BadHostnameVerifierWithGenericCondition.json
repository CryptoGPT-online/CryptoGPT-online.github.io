### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse:** CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Vulnerable Method:** `new HostNameVerifier(){ ... }`
**Reason:** The code overrides the default hostname verifier and accepts all hostnames only when the SSL session is null. This is a valid approach to handle cases where SSL sessions are not available, such as when connecting to a local server for development or testing purposes.
