    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}",
    "description": "The code creates a custom HostNameVerifier that always returns true, which means that it will accept any hostname presented by the server, even if it does not match the hostname specified in the certificate. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate server and trick users into sending their sensitive information to the attacker's server.",
