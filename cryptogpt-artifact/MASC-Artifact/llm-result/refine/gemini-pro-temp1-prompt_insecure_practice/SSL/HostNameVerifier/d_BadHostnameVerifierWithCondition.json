### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
   - Vulnerable Code: `true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0`
   - Justification: This code does not use a hard-coded cryptographic key. The `session.getCipherSuite().length()` expression returns the length of the cipher suite, which is not a cryptographic key.

   "vulnerable_method": "HostNameVerifier.verify",
   "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)",
   "description": "The code always returns true, regardless of the value of `session.getCipherSuite()`. This means that the hostname will always be verified, even if the cipher suite is not secure.",
   "recommendation": "The code should be changed to only return true if the cipher suite is secure."

2. {

   "vulnerable_method": "HostNameVerifier.verify",
   "vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
   "description": "This code is vulnerable to the Broken Crypto Algorithm weakness because it uses a weak cipher suite. The length of the cipher suite is not a reliable indicator of its strength. Attackers could exploit this weakness by sending a specially crafted request that uses a weak cipher suite, which could allow them to decrypt the traffic or impersonate the server.",
   "recommendation": "Use a strong cipher suite that is appropriate for the application's security requirements."
