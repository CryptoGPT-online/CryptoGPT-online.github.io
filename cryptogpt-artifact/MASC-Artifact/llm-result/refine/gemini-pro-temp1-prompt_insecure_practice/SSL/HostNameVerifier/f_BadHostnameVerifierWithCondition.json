### False Positive Misuse ###
1.  **Misuse**: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
    **Vulnerable Code**: `session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0`
    **Description**: The code checks if the length of the cipher suite string is greater than or equal to 0. This is not a meaningful check for verifying the strength of the encryption.
    **Recommendation**: Use a proper cryptographic library or framework to verify the strength of the encryption.
    **Justification**: This is a false positive because the code is not using the length of the cipher suite to determine the strength of the encryption. The code is simply checking if the cipher suite is not empty.

2. **Misuse**: Broken Hostname Verification
    **Vulnerable Code**: `new HostNameVerifier(){...}`
    **Description**: The code disables hostname verification, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    **Recommendation**: Implement proper hostname verification using a trusted certificate authority.
    **Justification**: This is a false positive because the code is not disabling hostname verification. The code is simply creating a new `HostnameVerifier` instance.
