### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse:** CWE-291: Improper Validation of Certificate Trust
**Vulnerable Code:** `boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {\nreturn true;\n}`
**Reason:** This code is part of a custom hostname verifier, which is used to verify the hostname in the SSL certificate. By always returning true, this code is accepting any hostname, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. However, this is not a misuse of the cryptographic API, but rather a misuse of the hostname verifier.

2. **Misuse:** Broken Crypto Algorithm
**Vulnerable Code:** `new HostnameVerifier(){...}`
**Reason:** This code creates a custom hostname verifier, which is used to verify the hostname in the SSL certificate. By always returning true, this code is accepting any hostname, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. However, this is not a misuse of the cryptographic API, but rather a misuse of the hostname verifier.
