### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Misuse**: Weak algorithm
**Vulnerable code**: NativePRNG with a fixed seed
**Description**: NativePRNG is not a cryptographically secure PRNG. Using it with a fixed seed makes it predictable and insecure.
**Recommendation**: Use a cryptographically secure PRNG, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(), and avoid using a fixed seed.
**Explanation**: The given code sets the seed of the two `SecureRandom` instances to the same fixed value, making them generate the same sequence of random numbers, which is a security risk. Using `NativePRNG` is a weak algorithm for generating random numbers, but the usage in this code is not considered a misuse because the `setSeed` method is used to initialize the PRNG with a fixed seed for testing purposes.
