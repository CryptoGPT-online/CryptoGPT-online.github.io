    "description": "SecureRandom is seeded with a fixed seed value, making it predictable and insecure for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) like java.security.SecureRandom and seed it with a strong seed, such as a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) or a hardware-based random number generator (HRNG)."

    "vulnerable_method": "new SecureRandom(byte[])",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);        \nSecureRandom rand2 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class uses a SHA1PRNG as the default PRNG, which is a deterministic algorithm that can be vulnerable to statistical attacks. To ensure strong randomness, a more secure PRNG should be used, such as SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA256PRNG\").",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure PRNG, such as SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA256PRNG\"), to ensure strong randomness."

    "vulnerable_method": "new SecureRandom(byte[])",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);        \nSecureRandom rand2 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with the same seed value for both `rand1` and `rand2`, which makes them predictable and insecure for cryptographic purposes. Using the same seed value for multiple instances of `SecureRandom` can compromise the security of the application because an attacker could potentially guess the seed value and predict the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, generate a cryptographically strong random seed using a secure random number generator (RNG) such as `java.security.SecureRandom` and use it to initialize the `SecureRandom` instances."

    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);\nSecureRandom rand2 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);",
    "description": "Using the same seed to initialize multiple `SecureRandom` instances is not secure. Each instance should be initialized with a unique seed to ensure the randomness of the generated values.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a cryptographically secure random seed for each `SecureRandom` instance using a secure random number generator (RNG) such as `java.security.SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`."

    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class should be initialized with a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that has sufficient entropy. Using a fixed seed value, such as a string, can make the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that has sufficient entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Consider using a hardware-based CSPRNG if possible."
