### False Positive Misuse ###
1. CWE-256: Cryptographic Key Exposure
> vulnerable_code: getName()
> description: The `getName()` method returns the name of the digest algorithm, which may expose the cryptographic key if the algorithm is a keyed algorithm.
---
The `getName()` method in this code is used to return the name of the digest algorithm, which is not a cryptographic key and therefore does not pose a security risk. Hence, this misuse is a **false positive**.
