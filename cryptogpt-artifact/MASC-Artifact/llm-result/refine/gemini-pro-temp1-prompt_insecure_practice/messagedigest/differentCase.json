  {
    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"md5\")",

    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is no longer considered secure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
