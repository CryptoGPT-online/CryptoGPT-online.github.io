### False Positive Misuse ###

I do not find any false positives in the provided lists of misuses. All the reported misuses are genuine and should be addressed.

    "misuse category": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance()",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"md5\"));",
    "description": "The code dynamically instantiates a cryptographic algorithm by replacing \"SHA-256\" with \"md5\" in the getInstance() method, which can lead to using a weak or insecure algorithm (CWE-327).",

    "description": "The code hardcodes the cryptographic algorithm \"md5\" into the program, which can lead to using a weak or insecure algorithm (CWE-321).",
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding cryptographic algorithms and instead use a secure and well-known algorithm, such as SHA-256, and configure it securely."
