### False Positive Misuse ###

The provided misuse reports are all applicable considering the code and context shared. The `IvParameterSpec` is indeed created from a non-random, deterministic source which can be easily predicted (`val` containing ASCII characters from 65 to 74). This approach to generating an IV can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, as reflected in the misuse reports.

There are no false positives to remove as each misuse accurately describes an issue with the code provided.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

The misuse reports can be optimized by removing duplicate entries across the different lists that identify the same issue. The optimized JSON should include unique misuse instances, each with a singular reference in the optimized array. 

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8)",
        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is created from a deterministic source (ASCII values 65 to 74) which is predictable and not cryptographically random.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to create the IV."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8)",
        "description": "The IV is not only predictable but also uses an insufficient length for most block ciphers, which typically require an IV size equal to the cipher's block size (e.g., 16 bytes for AES).",
        "recommendation": "Ensure IV is of the required length for the block cipher being used (e.g., 16 bytes for AES) and is randomly generated."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "vulnerable_code": "for(int i = 65; i < 75; i++){ val += (char) i; }",
        "description": "The code constructs a string from hardcoded values which are then used to generate an IV. Hardcoded values for cryptographic operations can lead to security weaknesses.",
        "recommendation": "Do not hardcode values used in cryptographic operations. Use securely stored configuration or secure storage mechanisms."
    }
]
```

It is worth noting that the redundant entries were consolidated, and the descriptions and recommendations were standardized to remove repetition and to focus on the core issues.
