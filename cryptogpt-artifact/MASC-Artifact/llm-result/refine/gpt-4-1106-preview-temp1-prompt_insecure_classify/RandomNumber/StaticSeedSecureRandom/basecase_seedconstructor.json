### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials - The misuse report describes the issue with the hardcoded seed, which is correct. However, it incorrectly identifies it as a case of hardcoded credentials, which usually refers to passwords, keys, or tokens, not seeds for random number generators. Hence, this particular misuse does not fall under the category of hardcoded credentials.

2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength - This misuse is based on the seed 'Seed' being short, guessable, and lacking complexity. However, CWE-326 generally pertains to the strength of the encryption algorithm, not the randomness or predictability of the seed value. Thus, this category does not apply to the misuse of seeding a `SecureRandom`.
