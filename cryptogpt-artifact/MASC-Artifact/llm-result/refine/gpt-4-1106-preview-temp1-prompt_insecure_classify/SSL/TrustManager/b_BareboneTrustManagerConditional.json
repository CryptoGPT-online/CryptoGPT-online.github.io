### False Positive Misuse ###

The reported misuse "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" concerning `new SecureRandom()` appears to be a false positive. The `SecureRandom` class is designed to provide a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG). Without additional context showing improper implementation or seeding, the usage of `new SecureRandom()` should be considered appropriate for cryptographic operations and security-sensitive applications. Thus, the entries referring to "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" associated with `new SecureRandom()` are not applicable.
