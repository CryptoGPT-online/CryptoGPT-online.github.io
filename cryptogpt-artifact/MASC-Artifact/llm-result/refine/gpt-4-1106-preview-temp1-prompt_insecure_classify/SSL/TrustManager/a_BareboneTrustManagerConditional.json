### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
   This misuse refers to a commented-out line that would normally be a valid issue. However, because the code isn't active, it does not currently pose a security risk. The implementation of `SecureRandom` without a specified seed is safe in this context, as the behavior will use a platform-specific seed source.
