### False Positive Misuse ###

All of the misuse reports flag the usage of MD5 as a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, which is generally true. However, in the provided code, despite the `.replace("SHA-256", "md5")` call, there is no actual misuse of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. The reason is the argument `"SHA-256"` is replaced by `"md5"` but since it replaces `"SHA-256"` with itself, the `MessageDigest.getInstance` method is being effectively called with `"SHA-256"` as its parameter. The replacement operation has no effect because the replaced and replacement strings are the same.

Therefore, all misuse reports are false positives, since the code never actually uses MD5 for the hashing operation.
