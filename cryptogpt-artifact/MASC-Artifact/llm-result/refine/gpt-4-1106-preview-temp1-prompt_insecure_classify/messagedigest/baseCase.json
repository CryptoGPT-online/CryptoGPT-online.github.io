### False Positive Misuse ###

After reviewing the provided misuse lists, it can be seen that all of them are correctly identifying the use of MD5 as insecure. There are no false positives in this case since MD5 is indeed a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm as reported. Consequently, all the misuse reports are applicable, and there are no false positives to remove.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

Since all the misuse reports essentially capture the same issue with slight variations in wording, the optimized misuse list can be a single entry that consolidates the descriptions and recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
        "description": "MD5 is a widely considered broken and insecure cryptographic hash function. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and should not be used for secure applications due to its proven inability to ensure data integrity.",
        "recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
