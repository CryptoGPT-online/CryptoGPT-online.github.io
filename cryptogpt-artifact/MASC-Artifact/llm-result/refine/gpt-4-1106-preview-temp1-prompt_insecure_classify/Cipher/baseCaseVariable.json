### False Positive Misuse ###
All the misuse reports provided are identifying the same potential issue: the use of `Cipher.getInstance` without specifying a mode and padding. Each report warns against the risks of defaulting to ECB mode and possibly insecure padding. However, these are not false positives because they accurately reflect on potential security risks. If no mode or padding is specified, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) defaults to ECB mode and PKCS5Padding for AES, which could lead to vulnerabilities like pattern recognition in ciphertext or padding oracle attacks.
