### False Positive Misuse ###

There do not appear to be any false positives in the provided misuse lists. All the listed misuses accurately reflect a security concern with the Java code provided, which is the use of DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm that is outdated and vulnerable due to its 56-bit key size.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

The misuse lists contain redundancy, with multiple entries stating essentially the same information about the inadequacy of DES as a cryptographic algorithm. Therefore, an optimized list that removes the redundancy but maintains the necessary information would look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"des\".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH));",
        "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered insecure due to its short key length of 56 bits, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks. Modern applications should use stronger algorithms like AES.",
        "recommendation": "Replace DES with a more secure algorithm such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
    }
]
``` 

This single entry consolidates the information from the misuse reports and avoids duplication.
