### False Positive Misuse ###
There are no false positives identified among the misuse reports provided. All reports correctly identify the use of DES (Data Encryption Standard) as a misuse of cryptographic API, which is justified because DES is indeed an outdated and insecure algorithm due to its small key size. All of the listed reports essentially point to the same security issue related to the use of DES.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
Since all reports are highlighting the same issue with different descriptions and recommendations, it is better to consolidate them into a single report. We'll take the best-suited information from all to construct a comprehensive report:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"des\")",
    "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered a broken and insecure cryptographic algorithm due to its short key length of 56 bits, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks and known vulnerabilities like the Sweet32 attack. Modern enterprises have deemed it obsolete and vulnerable to attacks with modern computing power.",
    "recommendation": "Replace 'DES' with a more secure algorithm such as 'AES' with a key size of at least 128 bits. Preferably use authenticated encryption modes such as GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) to provide both confidentiality and integrity."
  }
