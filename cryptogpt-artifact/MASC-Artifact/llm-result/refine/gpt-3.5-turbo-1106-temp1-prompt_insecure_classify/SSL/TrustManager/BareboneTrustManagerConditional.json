    "description": "The code uses a TrustManager that blindly trusts all certificates without proper validation.",

    "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation logic in the custom X509TrustManager implementation to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the certificates. Ensure proper validation of the server and client certificates by verifying the certificate chain, expiration, revocation status, and hostname. Consider using a TrustManager that performs full validation."
