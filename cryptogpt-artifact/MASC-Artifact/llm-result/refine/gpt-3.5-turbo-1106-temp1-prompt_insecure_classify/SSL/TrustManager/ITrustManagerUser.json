[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "new ITrustManager() { ... }",
    "description": "The code is implementing a custom X509TrustManager without properly implementing the certificate validation logic in the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods.",
    "recommendation": "Use a properly implemented TrustManager or ensure that the custom implementation correctly validates the server and client certificates to prevent improper certificate validation."

    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public interface ITrustManager extends X509TrustManager { ... }",
    "description": "The code does not perform any certificate validation in the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods. It simply implements these methods without any validation logic, which can lead to insecure connections.",
    "recommendation": "Proper certificate validation logic should be implemented within the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods to ensure the security of the connections."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public interface ITrustManager extends X509TrustManager {}",
    "description": "The code snippet defines a custom TrustManager interface by extending X509TrustManager without implementing proper certificate validation checks in the overridden methods.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic in the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods to validate the presented certificates against a trusted CA store."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public interface ITrustManager extends X509TrustManager { }",
    "description": "The code is creating a custom TrustManager by implementing the X509TrustManager interface directly instead of extending the built-in X509ExtendedTrustManager. This may lead to improper certificate validation as the custom TrustManager may not perform all necessary checks for secure certificate validation.",
    "recommendation": "Extend the X509ExtendedTrustManager instead of implementing the X509TrustManager directly, and override the checkServerTrusted and checkClientTrusted methods to provide custom validation logic while ensuring all necessary checks are performed."
