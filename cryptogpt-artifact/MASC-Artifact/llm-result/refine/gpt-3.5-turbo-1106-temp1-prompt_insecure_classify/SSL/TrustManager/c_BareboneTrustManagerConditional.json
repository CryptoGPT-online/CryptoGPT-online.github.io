    "description": "The custom TrustManager implementation 'BareboneTrustManagerExt' does not perform proper certificate validation. It accepts any client or server certificates, as it always returns without throwing CertificateException.",
    "recommendation": "Proper certificate validation should be implemented within the 'checkClientTrusted' and 'checkServerTrusted' methods to ensure that only valid and trusted certificates are accepted. Additionally, the 'getAcceptedIssuers' method should return the acceptable issuers' certificates."
