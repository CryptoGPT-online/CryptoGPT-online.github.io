### False Positive Misuse ###
The reported misuses are not false positives. They all accurately identify potential issues with the code that may lead to the selection of less-secure cryptographic algorithms during SSL/TLS negotiation.

  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0){",
    "description": "The code always returns true regardless of the actual cipher suite used in the SSL session, which may allow the use of less secure cryptographic algorithms during the SSL negotiation.",
    "recommendation": "Review the logic to properly verify the SSL session's cipher suite and ensure that only secure cryptographic algorithms are allowed."
