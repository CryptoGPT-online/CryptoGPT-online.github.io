### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "public class Be { public static void main(String[] args) { new HostnameVerifier(){ @Override public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub return true; } }; } }",
  "description": "The code overrides the verify method of HostnameVerifier without actually implementing any validation logic for the SSL certificate. It simply returns true, which means it is not verifying the hostname in the SSL certificate, making the SSL connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic in the verify method to ensure that the SSL certificate is validated against the hostname."}
