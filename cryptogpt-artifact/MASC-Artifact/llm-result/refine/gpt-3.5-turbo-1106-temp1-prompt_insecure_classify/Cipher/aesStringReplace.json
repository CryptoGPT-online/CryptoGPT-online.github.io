None

### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\".replace(\"A\", \"D\"));",
    "description": "The code is dynamically modifying the algorithm name by replacing 'A' with 'D', which could result in a different and potentially less secure algorithm being selected during runtime.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid dynamically modifying the algorithm name and use a secure, standard algorithm directly, such as 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding'."
