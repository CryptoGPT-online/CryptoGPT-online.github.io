```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\".replace(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\", \"DES\"));",
    "description": "The code dynamically replaces the requested AES/GCM/NoPadding transformation with DES, which is a less-secure encryption algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the desired transformation directly instead of dynamically replacing it with a potentially less secure algorithm."
