### Optimized Misuse JSON###
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"md5\"));",
    "description": "The code attempts to select the SHA-256 algorithm, but then replaces it with MD5 algorithm during runtime, potentially leading to the use of a less-secure algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid dynamically replacing cryptographic algorithms at runtime. Use the intended algorithm directly without any replacements."
  }
