    "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"MD5\"));",
    "description": "The code attempts to replace the SHA-256 algorithm with MD5, which is less secure. This could result in the selection of a less-secure algorithm during the negotiation process.",
    "recommendation": "Use the secure algorithm directly without any replacements, and avoid dynamic algorithm selection based on string manipulation."
