### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "vulnerable_code": "digestName = \"MD5\";",
        "description": "The code sets the digestName to use MD5 as the cryptographic algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure for most cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Use secure cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256 instead of MD5 for hashing operations."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName());",
        "description": "The code uses method chaining to select the algorithm for the MessageDigest instance, potentially resulting in the selection of a less secure algorithm. The chaining of methods A() and B() sets the algorithm name to 'MD5', which is known to be less secure compared to 'SHA-256'.",
        "recommendation": "Use a direct assignment to specify the algorithm name, and avoid method chaining for algorithm selection. Ensure that only secure algorithms are used for cryptographic operations."
