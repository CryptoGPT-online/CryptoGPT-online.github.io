 ### False Positive Misuse Analysis ###

The provided code has several misuses that are not necessarily vulnerabilities. Here are the misuses that were flagged by the security scanner:

* CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
* CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
* CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
* CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation

However, upon closer analysis, we can determine that some of these misuses are not applicable. For example:

* CWE-798: The code does not hardcode any credentials, so this misuse is not relevant.
* CWE-295: The code does not validate the server's certificate, but this is not necessarily a vulnerability. The code should validate the server's certificate, but this is not a hardcoded value.
* CWE-326: The code uses a weak encryption algorithm (NULL), but this is not necessarily a vulnerability. The code should use a stronger encryption algorithm, but this is not a hardcoded value.
* CWE-757: The code selects a less secure encryption algorithm (NULL), but this is not necessarily a vulnerability. The code should select a stronger encryption algorithm, but this is not a hardcoded value.

Therefore, we can conclude that the provided code does not contain any false positive misuses.
