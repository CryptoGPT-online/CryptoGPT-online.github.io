I identified several security issues in the code you provided. Here are my findings:

1. Misuse: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.
	* Vulnerable Code: The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods in the `Ir` class do not validate the certificate chain.
	* Description: The code does not check if the certificate chain is valid or not, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
	* Recommendation: Implement proper certificate validation in the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods.
2. Misuse: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
	* Vulnerable Code: The `getAcceptedIssuers` method in the `Ir` class returns an empty array of `X509Certificate` objects.
	* Description: The code does not use any random values, which makes it vulnerable to attacks that rely on predictable behavior.
	* Recommendation: Use random values in the `getAcceptedIssuers` method.
3. Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
	* Vulnerable Code: The `Ir` class uses the `X509TrustManager` interface, which is a legacy interface that may use weak or broken cryptographic algorithms for certificate validation.
	* Description: The code does not provide any information about the specific algorithm used for certificate validation.
	* Recommendation: Consider using a more secure and updated cryptographic library or interface, such as the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) or the Bouncy Castle library.
4. Misuse: CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.
	* Vulnerable Code: The `Ir` class does not specify any algorithm during negotiation.
	* Description: The code does not specify any algorithm during negotiation, which makes it vulnerable to attacks that rely on the use of insecure algorithms.
	* Recommendation: Specify an appropriate algorithm during negotiation in the `Ir` class.
5. Misuse: CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.
	* Vulnerable Code: The `Ir` class does not use any hardcoded credentials.
	* Description: The code does not use any hardcoded credentials, which makes it vulnerable to attacks that rely on credentials being stored in clear text.
	* Recommendation: Use appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms in the `Ir` class.
6. Misuse: CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.
	* Vulnerable Code: The `Ir` class does not specify any algorithm during negotiation.
	* Description: The code does not specify any algorithm during negotiation, which makes it vulnerable to attacks that rely on the use of insecure algorithms.
	* Recommendation: Specify an appropriate algorithm during negotiation in the `Ir` class.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
