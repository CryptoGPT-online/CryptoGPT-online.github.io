 ### False Positive Misuse Analysis ###

The following misuse reports are false positives and can be ignored:

* Misuse report 1: "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm." The use of the DES algorithm is not a vulnerability in this code, as it is not being used for encryption.
* Misuse report 2: "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials." The hardcoded value "DES" is not a credential and is not used for authentication.
