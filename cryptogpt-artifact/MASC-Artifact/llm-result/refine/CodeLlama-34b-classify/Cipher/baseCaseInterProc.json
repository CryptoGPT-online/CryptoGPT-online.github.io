 ### False Positive Misuse Analysis ###

The following misuse reports are false positives and should be excluded from the final list:

1. Misuse Report 1: "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
	* False positive reason: The code uses the "AES/GCM/NoPadding" algorithm, which is a secure and recommended algorithm for encryption.
2. Misuse Report 2: "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation"
	* False positive reason: The code uses a secure and recommended algorithm for encryption.

### Optimized Misuse JSON

The following misuse reports are not false positives and should be included in the final list:

1. Misuse Report 3: "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
	* Vulnerable code: `cipherName = "DES";`
	* Description: The code uses the "DES" algorithm, which is a broken and insecure algorithm that should not be used in new code. It is only included for backwards compatibility with legacy systems.
	* Recommendation: Use a more secure and modern algorithm such as AES/GCM/NoPadding instead.
2. Misuse Report 4: "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation"
	* Vulnerable code: `cipherName = "DES"`
	* Description: The code selects the cryptographic algorithm to use based on a string variable, which is a potentially insecure practice. It is recommended to use a secure and modern algorithm such as AES/GCM/NoPadding instead.
	* Recommendation: Use a more secure and modern algorithm such as AES/GCM/NoPadding instead.
