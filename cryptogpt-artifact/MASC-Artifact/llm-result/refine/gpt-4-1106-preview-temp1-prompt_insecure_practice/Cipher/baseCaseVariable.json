### False Positive Misuse ###

The reported misuses generally highlight two main issues: the lack of specification for the mode and padding scheme when creating a `Cipher` instance, and the absence of initialization details such as an IV or a key. However, the code snippet given doesn't provide enough context to definitively determine whether these are real issues or false positives.

In particular, the warnings about the "No Secure Randomness" and "Missing Key Specification" might be considered false positives purely within the provided code context because the code doesn't attempt to initiate encryption or decryption; it merely initializes a `Cipher` instance without specifying the mode and padding. 

Without further code, we cannot assert whether there is a misuse in how randomness is approached, as there is no key generation or IV setup visible in the provided code. The criticisms are still potentially valid but could be premature based on the current scope of the review.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

The JSON below omits the potential false positives that involve secure randomness and key specification due to a lack of contextual information provided in the code snippet.
