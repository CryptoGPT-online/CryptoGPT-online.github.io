### False Positive Misuse ###

1. The "Hardcoded Encryption Algorithm" misuse report can be considered a false positive in the given context because the security concern here is not about the flexibility of changing the algorithm through configuration but rather the use of a weak algorithm (DES). The hardcoded nature of the algorithm does not by itself introduce a vulnerability, though it is a practice that can affect maintainability and adaptability of the code.

2. The "No Secure Random Number Generator" misuse is also a false positive as the provided code snippet does not show any operation that requires a random number generator, such as key or IV generation. The misuse report is important in general, but not applicable to the given code.

The rest of the misuse reports are valid: DES is indeed an outdated and weak encryption algorithm, and not specifying the mode and padding could potentially lead to insecure defaults.
