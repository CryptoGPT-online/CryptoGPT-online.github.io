### False Positive Misuse ###

- **Hardcoded Encryption Algorithm:** The report mentions that hardcoding the encryption algorithm might create a maintenance issue if the algorithm needs to be changed later. This, however, is not a security vulnerability but a software design choice that impacts flexibility and maintenance but does not directly lead to cryptographic weakness. Therefore, it's considered a false positive.
  
- **Default Encoding:** The misuse regarding `getBytes` and default encoding does not directly relate to cryptographic API misuse but rather to potential inconsistencies across platforms, which is not a problem specific to security but general software behavior. While it's a valid concern, it doesn't belong in a list focused exclusively on cryptographic API misuses, so it's a false positive related to the current context.
