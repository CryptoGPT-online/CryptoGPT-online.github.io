### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. All the reports correctly identify the risk associated with returning `true` in the `verify()` method of a custom `HostnameVerifier`. This implementation bypasses the crucial security check that ensures the server's certificate matches the hostname it was reached at, which is intended to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by matching the hostname against the CN (Common Name) or SAN (Subject Alternative Name) of the certificate presented by the server or use the default hostname verification provided by the Java SSL implementation."

I've consolidated the entries since they all refer to the same misuse with slightly different descriptions and implications. This singular entry now reflects the critical aspects of all provided entries: the misuse type (CWE-295), the problematic code, and comprehensive recommendations on how to rectify the misuse.
