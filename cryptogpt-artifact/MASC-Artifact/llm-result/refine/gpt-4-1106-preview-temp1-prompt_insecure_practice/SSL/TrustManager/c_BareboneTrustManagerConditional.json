### False Positive Misuse ###

The reported misuse related to "Use of SecureRandom without seed" may be considered a false positive in the given context. The SecureRandom class is designed to be secure even when it is not provided with a seed. The standard implementations of SecureRandom take care of seeding automatically, using entropy from the underlying operating system. Thus, explicitly seeding SecureRandom is not strictly necessary for typical use cases, including initializing an SSLContext.

    "vulnerable_code": "new BareboneTrustManagerExt() {...}",
    "description": "The custom TrustManager implementation does not properly validate certificate chains thus allowing any certificate to be trusted. This creates a severe security vulnerability by accepting any SSL certificate presented by the server, effectively bypassing SSL/TLS security.",

    "recommendation": "The getAcceptedIssuers method should return a non-empty array of certificates that the system can trust by default, or if the TrustManager is intended to trust all certificates (usually not recommended), then the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods should not be made void, but rather should implement proper validation."
