### False Positive Misuse ###

1. Misuse: "Usage of SecureRandom() without seed"
   - This is marked as a false positive because using `new SecureRandom()` without an explicit seed is actually recommended in Java. The `SecureRandom` class is designed to be self-seeding from a high-entropy source provided by the operating system. Adding a seed explicitly might reduce the randomness quality if not done correctly.

2. Misuse: "Unreachable code"
   - This is not a false positive per se, but it is not a security concern. It is a logical flaw or inefficiency in the code. However, it does not directly pertain to a cryptographic API misuse. Ideally, this would be caught by a regular code review rather than a security audit.

3. Misuse: "Unused object"
   - This report about `SSLContext context;` not being used after its initialization is correct but is more about poor coding practices than a security vulnerability. The context object is intended to be used for setting up SSL sockets, and the misuse is its non-usage after creation, which is a logic error but not a security issue.
