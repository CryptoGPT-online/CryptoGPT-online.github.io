### False Positive Misuse ###

There are no false positives in the reported misuses. Each misuse report correctly identifies the use of MD5 as a weak hashing algorithm vulnerable to collision attacks.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

Here is the consolidated and deduplicated list of cryptographic API misuses which represent the core issue with the presented code:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Weak Hashing Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_code": "digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(algorithmName);",
        "description": "MD5 is a weak hashing algorithm, vulnerable to collision attacks, and unsuitable for security-relevant purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
    }
]
```
