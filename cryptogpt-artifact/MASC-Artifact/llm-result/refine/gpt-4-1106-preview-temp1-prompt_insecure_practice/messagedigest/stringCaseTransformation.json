### False Positive Misuse ###
All misuse reports provided refer to the actual cryptographic API misuse of using MD5, which is a known weak hash function. None of the misuse reports appear to be false positives as they all correctly identify the use of MD5 as insecure. 

However, the misuse reports are essentially duplicates of the same issue, with minor variations in wording. Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate these duplicate misuses into a single, clear report.
