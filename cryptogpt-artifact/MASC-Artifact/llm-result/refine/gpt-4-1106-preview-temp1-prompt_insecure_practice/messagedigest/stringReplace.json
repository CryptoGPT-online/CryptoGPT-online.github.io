### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the reported misuses are false positives. All provided reports correctly identify the use of the MD5 hash function, which is insecure and deprecated, making it inappropriate for use in cryptographic contexts due to its vulnerability to collision attacks.

### Optimized Misuse JSON###

        "description": "MD5 is a compromised hash function prone to collision attacks and is not suitable for security-critical applications.",
        "recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
