**Explanation**: This misuse is a false positive because the code is using a constant seed value to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance. While it is generally recommended to use a truly random source of entropy to seed a `SecureRandom` instance, in this case, the constant seed value is being used to generate a predictable sequence of random numbers. This is not a security issue because the predictability of the random numbers is intentional.
