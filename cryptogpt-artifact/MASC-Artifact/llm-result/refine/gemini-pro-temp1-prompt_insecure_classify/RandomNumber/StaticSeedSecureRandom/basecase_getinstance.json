[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom.setSeed(seedBytes)",
    "vulnerable_code": "rand1.setSeed(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed seed to initialize the SecureRandom instance, which makes the generated random numbers predictable. This can be a security risk if the random numbers are used for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and seed it with a truly random source, such as /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems or CryptGenRandom on Windows."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\");",
    "description": "The NativePRNG algorithm is deterministic, which means that if the seed is known, then the output of the random number generator is also known. This makes it unsuitable for use in security-sensitive applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\"), which is based on a cryptographic hash function."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\")",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand2 = SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\");",
    "description": "The code uses the same seed value for both rand1 and rand2, which means that the generated random numbers will be predictable and not truly random.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, use a secure random number generator (such as SecureRandom) and generate a new seed value for each instance."
