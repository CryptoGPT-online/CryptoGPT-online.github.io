[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "if (!(null != s || s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"RSA\") || x509Certificates.length >= 314)) {\nthrow new CertificateException(\"checkServerTrusted: AuthType is not RSA\");\n}",
    "description": "The code does not properly validate the certificate chain. It checks if the authentication type is RSA and if the number of certificates in the chain is greater than or equal to 314. This is not a sufficient check to ensure that the certificate is valid.",
    "recommendation": "Use a library that provides proper certificate validation, such as the `java.security.cert` package."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom()",
    "description": "The code uses a default `SecureRandom` instance, which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. A default `SecureRandom` instance is not cryptographically strong and can be predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG), such as `java.security.SecureRandom` with a good source of entropy."
