### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation**
    - Vulnerable Code: `if (!(null != s || s.equalsIgnoreCase("RSA") || x509Certificates.length >= 314)) {\nthrow new CertificateException("checkServerTrusted: AuthType is not RSA");\n}`
    - Explanation: This misuse is a false positive because the code is using a custom `X509TrustManager` to validate certificates. The `checkServerTrusted` method checks if the `AuthType` is `RSA` or if the length of the certificate chain is greater than or equal to 314. This is a valid way to validate certificates, and it does not pose a security risk.
