### False Positive Misuse ###
1. Misuse category: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
   - Vulnerable method: Bt.checkClientTrusted
   - Vulnerable code: "// TODO Auto-generated method stub"
   - Description: The code does not perform any certificate validation, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - Recommendation: Implement proper certificate validation by checking the certificate chain and hostname.

   **Reason:**
   This misuse is a false positive because the method `checkClientTrusted` is intended to be overridden by a subclass. The code in the provided snippet is only a placeholder, and the actual implementation of certificate validation would be defined in the subclass.
