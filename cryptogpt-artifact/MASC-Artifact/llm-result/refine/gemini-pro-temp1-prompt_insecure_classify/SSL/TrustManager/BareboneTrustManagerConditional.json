  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_method": "X509TrustManager.checkClientTrusted",
    "vulnerable_code": "if (!(null != s && s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"RSA\")))",
    "description": "The code does not properly validate the certificate's issuer. It only checks if the certificate's signature algorithm is RSA, but it does not check if the certificate is issued by a trusted CA.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more strict certificate validation policy that checks the issuer of the certificate."
  },

    "misuse category": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_method": "SSLContext.init",
    "vulnerable_code": "new SecureRandom()",
    "description": "The code uses a default SecureRandom instance, which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. A default SecureRandom instance is not cryptographically strong and can be predictable.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG) such as SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")."
