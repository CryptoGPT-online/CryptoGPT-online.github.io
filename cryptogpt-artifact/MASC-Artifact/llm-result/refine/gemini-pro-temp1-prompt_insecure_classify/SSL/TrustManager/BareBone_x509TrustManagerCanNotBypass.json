    "description": "The provided code implements a custom X509TrustManager that trusts all certificates, bypassing all certificate validation checks. This can lead to accepting untrusted or expired certificates, which can allow attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or impersonate trusted entities.",

    "description": "The code creates a custom X509TrustManager that does not perform any certificate validation. This means that any certificate, even invalid or expired ones, will be accepted by the TLS/SSL connection. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security vulnerabilities.",
