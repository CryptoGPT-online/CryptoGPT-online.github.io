### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Vulnerable Code:** `if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)`
**Description:** This misuse is a false positive because the code is not validating the server's certificate. It is only checking the length of the cipher suite, which is not a valid check for certificate validation.
**Recommendation:** N/A
