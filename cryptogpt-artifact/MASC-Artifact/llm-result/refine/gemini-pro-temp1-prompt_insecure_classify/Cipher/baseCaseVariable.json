### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
 **Vulnerable Code:** `String algorithmName = "AES";`
 **Description:** The AES algorithm is not considered secure for new applications and should not be used.
 **Recommendation:** Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES-256.
 **Reasoning**: The code is using AES in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding, which is a secure combination. AES is still considered secure for most use cases, but it is recommended to use AES-256 for new applications.
