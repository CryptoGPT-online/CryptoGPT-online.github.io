    "description": "AES/GCM is an authenticated encryption mode that provides both confidentiality and integrity. However, if the key size is not sufficiently large, it may be possible for an attacker to break the encryption. The recommended key size for AES/GCM is 256 bits.",
    "recommendation": "Use a key size of at least 256 bits when using AES/GCM."

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");",
    "description": "The code uses the AES/GCM/NoPadding cipher, which is not recommended for use because it does not provide authenticated encryption. Instead, you should use a cipher that provides authenticated encryption, such as AES/GCM/Padding.",
    "recommendation": "Change the cipher to use a cipher that provides authenticated encryption, such as AES/GCM/Padding."

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");",
    "description": "The code uses AES in GCM mode with no padding, which is not recommended for encrypting large amounts of data. GCM mode is designed for encrypting small messages, and using it with no padding can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding."

    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");",
    "description": "The code uses the `AES` cipher with `NoPadding` padding. This combination does not provide sufficient encryption strength, as the plaintext is not padded before encryption, which can lead to information leakage.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher and padding combination, such as `AES/GCM/PKCS5Padding`, or use a different encryption algorithm altogether."
