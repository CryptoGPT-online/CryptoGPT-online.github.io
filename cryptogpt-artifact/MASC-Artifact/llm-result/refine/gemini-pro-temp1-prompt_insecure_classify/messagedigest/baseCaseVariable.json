### False Positive Misuse ###

- Misuse: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Vulnerable code: String algorithmName = "MD5";
Description: The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.
Recommendation: Use a more secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512.

**Reason**: In this case, the code in question does not use the MD5 algorithm. It simply assigns the string "MD5" to a variable. This is not a misuse of the cryptographic API.
