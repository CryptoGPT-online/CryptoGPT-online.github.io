### False Positive Misuse ###
None of the provided misuses are false positives. MD5 is indeed a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for any security-sensitive purposes.

### Optimized Misuse JSON ###
The optimized list of misuses in JSON format is:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance()",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest cryptoDigest;\n        try {\n            cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"MD5\"));",
    "description": "The code uses MD5 algorithm, which is considered as insecure",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256."
  }
]
