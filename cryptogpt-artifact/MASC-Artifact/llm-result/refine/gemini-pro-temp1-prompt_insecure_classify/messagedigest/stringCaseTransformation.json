### False Positive Misuse ###

None of the reported misuses are false positives. All of them correctly identify the use of the MD5 algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.

  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance",
    "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"md5\".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH));",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This makes it unsuitable for applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
