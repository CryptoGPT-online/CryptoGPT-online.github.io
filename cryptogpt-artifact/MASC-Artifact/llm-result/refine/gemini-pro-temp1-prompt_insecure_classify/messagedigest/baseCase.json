### Optimized Misuse JSON ###

```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "MessageDigest.getInstance()",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD5 hash.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
