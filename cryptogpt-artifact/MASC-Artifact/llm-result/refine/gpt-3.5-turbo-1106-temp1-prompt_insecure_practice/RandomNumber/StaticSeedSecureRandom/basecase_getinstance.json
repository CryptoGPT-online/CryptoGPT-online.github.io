        "misuse": "Insecure Randomness",
        "vulnerable_code": "rand1.setSeed(seedBytes);\nrand2.setSeed(seedBytes);",
        "description": "Setting the seed of two different SecureRandom instances with the same value reduces the randomness and predictability of the generated random numbers.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting seeds manually, and instead rely on the SecureRandom instance to generate its own seed or use a cryptographically secure random number generator."
