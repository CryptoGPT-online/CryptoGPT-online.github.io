 Here is the JSON output for the security issue:
[
  {
    "misuse": "Weak Encryption Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"des\".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH));",
    "description": "The encryption algorithm used is a weak 64-bit block cipher, which is vulnerable to various attacks, such as the famous \"DES weakness\" attack.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES, to secure the data."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Broken Crypto Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"des\".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH))",
    "description": "The use of the DES encryption algorithm is insecure because it uses a relatively small key size (56 bits) and is vulnerable to brute force attacks. It is recommended to use AES encryption algorithm instead.",
    "recommendation": "Use AES encryption algorithm with a larger key size (128 bits or larger) and consider using a secure mode of operation such as GCM or CBC."
  }
]
The vulnerable code is `Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("des".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH));`, which uses the weak encryption algorithm "des". The recommendation is to use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES, to secure the data.

The vulnerable code is `Cipher.getInstance("des".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH))`, which uses the broken encryption algorithm "des". The recommendation is to use a secure encryption algorithm such as AES instead.

The vulnerable code is `Cipher.getInstance("des")`, which uses the broken encryption algorithm "des". The recommendation is to use a secure encryption algorithm such as AES instead.
