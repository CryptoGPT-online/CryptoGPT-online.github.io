  "description": "Setting the seed of SecureRandom using a fixed value 'Seed' can lead to predictable and insecure random number generation. This could result in security vulnerabilities in cryptographic operations or other security-sensitive applications.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the seed value, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() or use a proper cryptographic algorithm to generate the seed value. Avoid using insecure seeds or predictable values for random number generation."}]
