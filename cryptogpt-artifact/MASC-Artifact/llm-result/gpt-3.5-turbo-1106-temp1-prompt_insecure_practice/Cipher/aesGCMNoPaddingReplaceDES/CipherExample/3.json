[{"misuse": "Insecure Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\".replace(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\", \"DES\"));","description": "The code is replacing the cipher algorithm with a weaker one (DES) after obtaining the instance using AES/GCM/NoPadding. This can lead to the use of an insecure encryption algorithm, potentially weakening the security of the application.", "recommendation": "Modify the code to use a secure algorithm from the beginning, and do not replace it with a weaker algorithm. Always choose algorithms that are recommended for security use, such as AES/GCM/NoPadding."}]
