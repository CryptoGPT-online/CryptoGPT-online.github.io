"description": "The code is attempting to replace AES/GCM/NoPadding with DES but this does not actually change the algorithm being used. It still uses DES algorithm which is known to be weak compared to AES.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure encryption algorithm like AES/GCM/NoPadding and avoid using insecure algorithms like DES."}
