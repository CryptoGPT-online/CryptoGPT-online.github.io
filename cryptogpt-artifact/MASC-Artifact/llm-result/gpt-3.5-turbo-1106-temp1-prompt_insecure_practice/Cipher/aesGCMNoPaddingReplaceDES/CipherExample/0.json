[{"misuse": "Incorrect Algorithm Usage", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\".replace(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\", \"DES\"));",
  "description": "The code attempts to specify an AES/GCM/NoPadding transformation and then replaces it with DES, which is an entirely different algorithm. This can lead to a vulnerability if the system mistakenly uses DES instead of AES/GCM/NoPadding.",
  "recommendation": "Specify the correct algorithm and mode of operation directly in the getInstance method, and avoid using replace method for algorithm specification."}]
