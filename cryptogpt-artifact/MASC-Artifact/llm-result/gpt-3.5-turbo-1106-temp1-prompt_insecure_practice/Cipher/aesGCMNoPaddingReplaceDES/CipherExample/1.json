  "description": "The code is attempting to use DES encryption, but the algorithm is incorrectly specified as AES/GCM/NoPadding, and then replacing it with DES. This is an insecure use of the cryptographic API.", 
  "recommendation": "Use the correct algorithm (e.g., DES) when initializing the Cipher object and ensure that it is not susceptible to known vulnerabilities."}]
