  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\")", 
  "description": "Using AES/GCM/NoPadding can be insecure as it does not provide necessary integrity checks. The GCM mode requires an authentication tag for secure operations, and not providing padding could lead to vulnerabilities.", 
  "recommendation": "Use AES/GCM mode with an appropriate padding mechanism and ensure the authentication tag is verified for data integrity and authenticity."}]
