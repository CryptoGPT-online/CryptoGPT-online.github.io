[{"misuse": "Incomplete or Hostname Verification", 
  "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; }", 
  "description": "The implementation of the HostnameVerifier interface's verify method blindly returns true, which disables the hostname verification process for SSL/TLS connections. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can impersonate the server and the client would not be aware of it.", 
  "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification logic in the verify method to ensure that the hostname matches the identity of the server in SSL/TLS connections."}]
