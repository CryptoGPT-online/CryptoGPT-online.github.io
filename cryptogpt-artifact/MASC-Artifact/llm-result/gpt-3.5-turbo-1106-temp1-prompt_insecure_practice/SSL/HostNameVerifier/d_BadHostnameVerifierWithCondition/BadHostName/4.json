  "description": "The condition 'true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0' does not provide a proper verification for the SSL/TLS session security. The length condition is not a secure way to verify the strength of the cipher suite being used.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure approach to verify the strength of the cipher suite, such as checking against a list of approved or minimum strength cipher suites."}]
