Sure, I've reviewed the code you provided and identified the following potential crypto API misuse:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "String algorithmName = \"AES\";",
    "description": "The code uses the `AES` algorithm, which is considered insecure due to its susceptibility to attacks such as Sweet32. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as `AES-256`.",
    "recommendation": "Change the algorithm to a more secure one, such as `AES-256` or `ChaCha20`."
  }
]
```
