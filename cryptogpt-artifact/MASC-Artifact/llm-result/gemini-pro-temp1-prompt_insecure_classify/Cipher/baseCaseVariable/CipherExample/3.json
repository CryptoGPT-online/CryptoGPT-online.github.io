[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "String algorithmName = \"AES\";", "description": "AES is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that uses a 128-bit key by default. This key size is considered to be inadequate by today's standards, and it is recommended to use a key size of at least 256 bits.", "recommendation": "Change the algorithm to use a stronger key size, such as AES-256."}]
