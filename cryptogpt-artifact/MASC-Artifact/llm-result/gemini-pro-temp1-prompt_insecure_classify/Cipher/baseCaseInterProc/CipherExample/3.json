    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(new CipherExample().methodA().methodB().getCipherName());",
    "description": "The code first sets the cipher name to \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\" in methodA(), then changes it to \"DES\" in methodB(), and finally gets the cipher name in getCipherName(). This allows an attacker to specify a weak cipher algorithm (such as DES) by calling methodB() before methodA().",
    "recommendation": "The code should set the cipher name to the strongest supported algorithm in methodA() and ensure that it cannot be changed in subsequent methods."
