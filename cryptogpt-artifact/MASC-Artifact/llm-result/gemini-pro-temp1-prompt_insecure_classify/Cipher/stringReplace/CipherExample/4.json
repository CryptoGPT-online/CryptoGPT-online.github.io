    "description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. DES has a key size of only 56 bits, which is too small to provide adequate security against modern attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES or Triple-DES."
