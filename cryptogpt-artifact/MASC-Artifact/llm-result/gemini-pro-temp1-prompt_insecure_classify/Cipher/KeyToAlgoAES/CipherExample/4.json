    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(keygen.getAlgorithm());",
    "description": "The code uses the `KeyGenerator.getAlgorithm()` to initialize the cipher, which is not recommended. Instead, it should use a more secure algorithm such as `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding` or `AES/GCM/NoPadding`. This is because the `KeyGenerator.getAlgorithm()` method returns the algorithm that was used to generate the key, which may not be a strong algorithm.",
