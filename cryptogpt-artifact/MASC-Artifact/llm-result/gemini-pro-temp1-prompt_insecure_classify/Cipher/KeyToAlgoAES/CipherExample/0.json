    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(key.getAlgorithm().toUpperCase());",
    "description": "The code uses the \"toUpperCase()\" method to get the algorithm name from the key. This is not a secure way to get the algorithm name because it can be changed by the attacker to any other algorithm. For example, if the key algorithm is \"AES\", the attacker can change it to \"DES\" by changing the value of \"key.getAlgorithm()\" to \"DES\".",
    "recommendation": "Use the \"getAlgorithm()\" method directly without using the \"toUpperCase()\" method."
