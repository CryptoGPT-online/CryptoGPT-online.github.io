    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");",
    "description": "The code uses the `AES` cipher with `NoPadding` padding. This combination does not provide sufficient encryption strength, as the plaintext is not padded before encryption, which can lead to information leakage.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cipher and padding combination, such as `AES/GCM/PKCS5Padding`, or use a different encryption algorithm altogether."
