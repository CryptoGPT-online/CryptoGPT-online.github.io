  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");",
    "description": "The code uses AES in GCM mode with no padding, which is not recommended for encrypting large amounts of data. GCM mode is designed for encrypting small messages, and using it with no padding can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding."
