    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "`MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName())`",
    "description": "The code uses `MessageDigest.getInstance()` to create a message digest using the algorithm name obtained from `MessageDigestComplex.getName()`. However, the `MessageDigestComplex` class allows the attacker to manipulate the algorithm name by chaining `A()` and `B()` methods, which could lead to using a weak or broken algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm that is not susceptible to known attacks. For example, use `SHA-256` or `SHA-512` instead of `MD5`."
