    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName());",
    "description": "The code uses the `MessageDigest` class to create a message digest object. The message digest object is used to calculate a hash of a given input. The `MessageDigest` class provides a variety of algorithms to choose from, including `SHA-256` and `MD5`. The `SHA-256` algorithm is a secure hashing algorithm that is commonly used to protect data. The `MD5` algorithm is a less secure hashing algorithm that is no longer recommended for use. In this code, the `MessageDigest` object is created using the `getName()` method of the `MessageDigestComplex` class. The `getName()` method returns the name of the algorithm that will be used to calculate the hash. The `MessageDigestComplex` class allows the user to specify the algorithm that will be used to calculate the hash. In this case, the user specifies that the `SHA-256` algorithm should be used. However, the user can also specify that the `MD5` algorithm should be used by calling the `B()` method of the `MessageDigestComplex` class. This is a security risk because the `MD5` algorithm is no longer considered to be secure.",
    "recommendation": "The code should be modified to use a secure hashing algorithm, such as `SHA-256`. The `MessageDigest` class provides a variety of secure hashing algorithms to choose from. The following code shows how to create a message digest object using the `SHA-256` algorithm:\n" +
