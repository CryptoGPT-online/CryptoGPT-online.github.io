    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "`cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName());`",
    "description": "The code uses `MessageDigest.getInstance` to create a `MessageDigest` object. The `MessageDigest` object is used to calculate a message digest of a given input. The `MessageDigest` object is created using the `getName()` method of the `MessageDigestComplex` class. The `getName()` method returns the name of the message digest algorithm to be used. In this case, the `getName()` method returns the name of the message digest algorithm that was set by the `A()` and `B()` methods of the `MessageDigestComplex` class. The `A()` method sets the name of the message digest algorithm to `SHA-256`. The `B()` method sets the name of the message digest algorithm to `MD5`. The `MessageDigest` object is created using the name of the message digest algorithm that was set by the `B()` method. This means that the `MessageDigest` object will use the `MD5` message digest algorithm. The `MD5` message digest algorithm is a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong cryptographic algorithm, such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`."
