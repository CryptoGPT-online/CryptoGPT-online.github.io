    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName());",
    "description": "The code uses the `MessageDigest` API to create a message digest object. However, the `getName()` method of the `MessageDigestComplex` class returns the name of the digest algorithm, which can be set to any value by the attacker. This means that the attacker can specify a weak or broken algorithm, such as MD5, which can be used to compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a fixed, strong cryptographic algorithm instead of allowing the attacker to specify the algorithm."
