    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"md5\");",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD5 hash. This makes it unsuitable for applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
