    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"md5\")",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. This makes it unsuitable for use in applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
