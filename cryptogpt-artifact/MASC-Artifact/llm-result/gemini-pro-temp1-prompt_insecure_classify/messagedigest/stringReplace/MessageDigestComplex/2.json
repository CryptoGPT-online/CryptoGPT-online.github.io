    "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure. Attackers can easily find collisions for MD5, which means they can create two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be used to bypass authentication or integrity checks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
