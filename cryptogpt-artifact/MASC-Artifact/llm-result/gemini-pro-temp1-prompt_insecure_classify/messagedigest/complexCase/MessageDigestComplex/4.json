    "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"md5\"));",
    "description": "The code is using the MessageDigest class to create a message digest object. The MessageDigest class is used to calculate a hash value for a message. The code is using the \"SHA-256\" algorithm, which is a cryptographically secure hash algorithm. However, the code is replacing \"SHA-256\" with \"md5\" using the replace() method. This is insecure because the MD5 algorithm is not cryptographically secure and should not be used.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
