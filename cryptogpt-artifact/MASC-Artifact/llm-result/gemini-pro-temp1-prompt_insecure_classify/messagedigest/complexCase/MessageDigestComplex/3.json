    "description": "The code is trying to use the MD5 algorithm, which is a broken and insecure hashing algorithm. MD5 has been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD5 hash. This makes MD5 unsuitable for use in any security-sensitive applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
