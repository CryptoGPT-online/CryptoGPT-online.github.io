    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered a broken cryptographic algorithm and should not be used for any security-sensitive applications. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
