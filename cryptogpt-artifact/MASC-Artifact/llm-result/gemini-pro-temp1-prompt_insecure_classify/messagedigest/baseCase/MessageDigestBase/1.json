    "description": "The code uses the `MD5` algorithm, which is considered broken and no longer secure. Attackers can easily find collisions for MD5, which means they can create two different messages that hash to the same value. This can be used to spoof messages or to create digital signatures that cannot be verified.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
