    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": `"MD5"`,
    "description": "MD5 is a broken cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD5 hash. This makes it unsuitable for use in applications where data integrity is important.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
