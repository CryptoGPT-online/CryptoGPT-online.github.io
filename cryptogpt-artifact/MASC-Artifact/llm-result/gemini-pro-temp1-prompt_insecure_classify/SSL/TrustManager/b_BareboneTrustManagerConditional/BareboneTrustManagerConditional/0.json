    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "if (!(null != s || s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"RSA\") || x509Certificates.length >= 314)) {\nthrow new CertificateException(\"checkServerTrusted: AuthType is not RSA\");\n}",
    "description": "The code is using a custom `X509TrustManager` to validate certificates. The `checkServerTrusted` method checks if the `AuthType` is `RSA` or if the length of the certificate chain is greater than or equal to 314. However, this validation is insufficient as it does not check for other important aspects of the certificate, such as the issuer, validity period, and subject alternative names.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more comprehensive certificate validation mechanism, such as the one provided by the `javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager` class."
