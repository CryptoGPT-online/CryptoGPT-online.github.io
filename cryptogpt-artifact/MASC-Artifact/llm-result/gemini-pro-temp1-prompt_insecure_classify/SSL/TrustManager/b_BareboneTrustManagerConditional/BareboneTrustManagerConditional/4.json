    "vulnerable_code": "if (!(null != s || s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"RSA\") || x509Certificates.length >= 314)) {\n              throw new CertificateException(\"checkServerTrusted: AuthType is not RSA\");\n            }",
    "description": "The code does not properly validate the server certificate. It checks if the authentication type is RSA and if the certificate chain has at least 314 certificates. However, it does not check if the certificate is issued by a trusted CA or if the hostname matches the certificate's CN.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation library, such as the one provided by the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), to validate the server certificate."
