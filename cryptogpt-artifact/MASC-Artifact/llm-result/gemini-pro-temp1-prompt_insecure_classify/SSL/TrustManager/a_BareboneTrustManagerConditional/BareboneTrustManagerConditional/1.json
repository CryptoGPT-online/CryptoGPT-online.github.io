Sure, here is the JSON output for the crypto API misuses in the provided code:
```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "`if (!(null != s || s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"RSA\") || x509Certificates.length >= 314)) {\n throw new CertificateException(\"checkServerTrusted: AuthType is not RSA\");\n}`",
    "description": "The code is not properly validating the certificate chain. It is accepting any certificate with a length of 314 or more, which is not secure.",
    "recommendation": "The code should be updated to use a more secure certificate validation mechanism, such as the one provided by the `javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection` class."
  }
