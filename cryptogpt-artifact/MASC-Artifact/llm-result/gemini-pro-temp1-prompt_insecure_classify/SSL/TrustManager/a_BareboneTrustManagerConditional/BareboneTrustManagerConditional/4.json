It only checks if the certificate chain is not null, if the authentication type is RSA, and if the certificate chain length is greater than or equal to 314. This is not sufficient to ensure that the certificate is valid.", "recommendation": "The code should use a proper certificate validation library, such as the javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager interface, to validate the certificate chain."}, {"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "context = SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\");", "description": "The code uses the TLS protocol, which is a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. TLS is vulnerable to a number of attacks, including the BEAST attack and the POODLE attack.", "recommendation": "The code should use a more secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3."}]
