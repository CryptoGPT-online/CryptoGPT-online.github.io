It checks if the authentication type is RSA and if the number of certificates in the chain is greater than or equal to 314. This is not sufficient validation and could allow an attacker to present a malicious certificate that is accepted by the code.", "recommendation": "The code should use a more robust certificate validation mechanism, such as using a trust manager that validates the certificate chain against a known set of trusted certificates."}, {"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", "vulnerable_code": "// SSLContext context;\n        // try {\n        //     context = SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\");\n        //     context.init(null, trustAll, new SecureRandom());\n\n        // } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {\n        //     // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        //     // e.printStackTrace();\n        // } catch (KeyManagementException e) {\n        //     // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        //     // e.printStackTrace();\n        // }", "description": "The code creates an SSL context with the default settings, which may allow less-secure algorithms to be negotiated.
