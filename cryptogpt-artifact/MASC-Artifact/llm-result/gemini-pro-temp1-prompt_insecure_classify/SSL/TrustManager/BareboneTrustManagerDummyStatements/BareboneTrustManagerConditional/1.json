					if (!(null != s && s.equalsIgnoreCase("RSA"))) {
						throw new CertificateException("checkServerTrusted: AuthType is not RSA");
					}
				}

				@Override
				public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {
					if (!(null != s && s.equalsIgnoreCase("RSA"))) {
						throw new CertificateException("checkServerTrusted: AuthType is not RSA");

	};
```

The code you provided is using a custom `TrustManager` to validate certificates. The `checkServerTrusted` and `checkClientTrusted` methods are both checking if the authentication type is "RSA". If it is not, a `CertificateException` is thrown. This is a misuse of the TLS API, as it is not the job of the `TrustManager` to check the authentication type. The `TrustManager` is only responsible for validating the certificate chain.

The correct way to check the authentication type is to use the `SSLParameters` class. The `SSLParameters` class has a `setEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm` method that can be used to set the authentication type. For example:

```java
SSLParameters sslParameters = new SSLParameters();
sslParameters.setEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm("RSA");
```

By using the `SSLParameters` class to set the authentication type, you can ensure that the TLS connection is using the correct authentication type.

The misuse in the code you provided is:
