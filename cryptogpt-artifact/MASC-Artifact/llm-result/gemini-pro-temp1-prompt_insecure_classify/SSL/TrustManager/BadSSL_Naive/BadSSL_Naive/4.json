    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(new DefaultHostnameVerifier());",
    "description": "The code disables hostname verification, which means that the server's certificate will not be validated against the hostname of the URL. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a hostname verifier that validates the server's certificate against the hostname of the URL. For example, use `HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(new HostnameVerifier() { ... })` and implement the `HostnameVerifier` interface to validate the hostname."
