{
  "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
  "vulnerable_code": "new BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypassExt {",
  "description": "The code creates a custom X509TrustManager that does not perform any certificate validation. This means that any certificate, even invalid or expired ones, will be accepted by the TLS/SSL connection. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Use a proper X509TrustManager implementation that validates certificates according to the intended security policy."
