    "description": "This code is vulnerable to CWE-295 because it uses a custom X509TrustManager that does not perform any validation of the certificate chain. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a trusted server and intercept or modify communications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a standard X509TrustManager implementation that performs proper validation of the certificate chain, such as the `TrustManagerFactory` class."
