    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypassExt implements X509TrustManager {...}",
    "description": "The provided code implements a custom X509TrustManager that trusts all certificates, bypassing all certificate validation checks. This can lead to accepting untrusted or expired certificates, which can allow attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or impersonate trusted entities.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper X509TrustManager implementation that performs proper certificate validation, such as the default TrustManager provided by the Java runtime."
