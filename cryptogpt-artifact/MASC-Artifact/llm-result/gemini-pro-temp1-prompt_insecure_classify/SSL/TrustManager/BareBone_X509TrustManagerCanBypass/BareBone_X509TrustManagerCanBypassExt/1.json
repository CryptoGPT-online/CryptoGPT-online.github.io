    "description": "The code uses a custom `X509TrustManager` that bypasses all certificate validation. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the traffic between the client and the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation mechanism, such as the default `X509TrustManager` provided by the JVM."
