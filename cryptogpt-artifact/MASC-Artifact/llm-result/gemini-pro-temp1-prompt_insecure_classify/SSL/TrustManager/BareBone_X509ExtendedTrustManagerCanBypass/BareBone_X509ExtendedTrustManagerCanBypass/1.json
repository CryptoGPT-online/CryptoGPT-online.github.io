    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "The code does not perform any certificate validation, leaving the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "description": "The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods of the `X509ExtendedTrustManager` interface are not implemented, which means that the code does not perform any certificate validation. This leaves the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, as an attacker could impersonate a trusted server and intercept communications.",
    "recommendation": "Implement the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods to validate the certificates presented by the peer. The validation should include checking the certificate's signature, issuer, and expiration date."
