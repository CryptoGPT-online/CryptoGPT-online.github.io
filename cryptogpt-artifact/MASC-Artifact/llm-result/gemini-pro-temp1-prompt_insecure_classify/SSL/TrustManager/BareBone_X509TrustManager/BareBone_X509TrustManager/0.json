There is one crypto API misuse in the code you provided:

{
  "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
  "vulnerable_code": "The checkServerTrusted and checkClientTrusted methods of X509TrustManager are not implemented, which means that all certificates will be trusted.",
  "description": "Improper certificate validation can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify communications between two parties. This can be used to steal sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.",
  "recommendation": "Implement the checkServerTrusted and checkClientTrusted methods to validate certificates properly."
