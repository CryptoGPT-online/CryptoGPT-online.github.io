The provided code has the following crypto API misuse:

{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "The `checkServerTrusted` and `checkClientTrusted` methods of the custom `X509TrustManager` are not implemented, which means that any certificate will be accepted without validation.",
"description": "The purpose of the `X509TrustManager` interface is to validate the trustworthiness of X.509 certificates. By not implementing the `checkServerTrusted` and `checkClientTrusted` methods, the custom `X509TrustManager` is effectively accepting any certificate without performing any validation. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a trusted party or to intercept and modify communications.",
"recommendation": "Implement the `checkServerTrusted` and `checkClientTrusted` methods to properly validate the trustworthiness of X.509 certificates."
