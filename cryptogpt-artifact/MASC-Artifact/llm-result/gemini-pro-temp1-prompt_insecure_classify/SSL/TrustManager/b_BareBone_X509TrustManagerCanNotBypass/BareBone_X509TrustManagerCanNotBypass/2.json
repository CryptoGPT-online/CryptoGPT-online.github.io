    "vulnerable_code": "BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass",
    "description": "The BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass class is a custom X509TrustManager that trusts all certificates. This means that any certificate will be accepted, even if it is not valid or trusted by a CA. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the traffic between the client and the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper X509TrustManager that validates certificates according to the desired security policy."
