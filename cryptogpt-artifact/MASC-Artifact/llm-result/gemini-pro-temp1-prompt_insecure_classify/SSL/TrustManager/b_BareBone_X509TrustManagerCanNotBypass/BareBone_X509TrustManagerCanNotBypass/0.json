  "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
  "vulnerable_code": "new BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass();",
  "description": "The code creates a new BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass() object, which is a custom trust manager that accepts all certificates. This means that the server's certificate will not be validated, which could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and intercept communications.",
  "recommendation": "Use a proper trust manager that validates the server's certificate."
