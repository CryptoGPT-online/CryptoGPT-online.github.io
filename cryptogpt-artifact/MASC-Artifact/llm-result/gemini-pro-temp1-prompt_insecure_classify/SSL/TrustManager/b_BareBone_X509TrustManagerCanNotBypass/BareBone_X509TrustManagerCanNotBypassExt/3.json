    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public class Bt implements X509TrustManager",
    "description": "The code implements the X509TrustManager interface, which is used to validate X.509 certificates. However, the code does not perform any validation of the certificates, which could allow an attacker to impersonate a trusted party.",
    "recommendation": "The code should be modified to perform proper validation of the certificates. This can be done by using the `X509Certificate.verify()` method to verify the certificate's signature and by checking the certificate's issuer and subject to ensure that they are trusted."
