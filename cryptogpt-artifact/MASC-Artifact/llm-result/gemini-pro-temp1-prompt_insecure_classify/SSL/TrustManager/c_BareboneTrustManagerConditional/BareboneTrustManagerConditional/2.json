[
  {

    "vulnerable_code": "if(!(true||arg0 == null||arg1 == null)){ \n throw new java.security.cert.CertificateException();\n }",
    "description": "The code does not properly validate the certificate chain. It always returns true, which means that any certificate will be accepted. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
