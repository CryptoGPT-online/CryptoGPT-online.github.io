    "description": "The code overrides the `verify` method of `HostnameVerifier` and unconditionally returns `true` when `session` is `null`. This can lead to accepting untrusted certificates and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by checking the certificate chain and hostname against a trusted source."
