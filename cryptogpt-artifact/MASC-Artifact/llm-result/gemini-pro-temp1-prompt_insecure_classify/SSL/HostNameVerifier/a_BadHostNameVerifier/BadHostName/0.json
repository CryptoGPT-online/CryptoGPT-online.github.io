    "description": "This code disables hostname verification for SSL connections. This means that the server's hostname will not be checked against the hostname specified in the certificate. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate server and intercept communications between the client and server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier to validate the server's hostname against the hostname specified in the certificate."
