    "vulnerable_code": "new HostnameVerifier(){....}",
    "description": "The code snippet creates a custom hostname verifier that always returns `true`, effectively disabling hostname verification for SSL connections. This can allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate server and intercept sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that validates the hostname against the expected value or use a library that handles certificate validation and hostname verification securely."
