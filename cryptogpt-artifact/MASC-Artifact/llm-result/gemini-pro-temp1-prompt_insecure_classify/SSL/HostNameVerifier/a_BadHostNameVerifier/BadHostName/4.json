    "description": "The code snippet is setting up a custom HostnameVerifier that always returns true, effectively disabling hostname verification. This is insecure because it allows the attacker to impersonate the server and intercept the communication.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a proper hostname verification mechanism that validates the server's certificate against a trusted certificate authority (CA)."
