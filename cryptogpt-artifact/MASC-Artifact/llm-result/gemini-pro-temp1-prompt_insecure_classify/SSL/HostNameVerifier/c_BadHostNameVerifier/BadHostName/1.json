    "description": "The code overrides the `verify` method of the `HostnameVerifier` class to always return `true`, which means that any SSL certificate will be accepted. This is insecure because it can allow attackers to spoof websites and intercept communications.",
    "recommendation": "The code should be changed to properly validate the SSL certificate. This can be done by using the `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` method to obtain a default SSL socket factory, which will use the system's default trust manager to validate certificates."
