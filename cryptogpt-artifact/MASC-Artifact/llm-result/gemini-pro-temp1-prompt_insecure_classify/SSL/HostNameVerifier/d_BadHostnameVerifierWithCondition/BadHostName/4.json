    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
    "vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
    "description": "The code uses the length of the cipher suite as a criterion to determine the security of the cipher suite, which is not a reliable indicator of the cipher suite's strength. This could allow an attacker to negotiate a weak cipher suite that is not appropriate for the application's security needs.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more robust method to determine the security of the cipher suite, such as checking the cipher suite's strength against a known list of strong cipher suites or using a library that provides support for secure cipher suite negotiation."
