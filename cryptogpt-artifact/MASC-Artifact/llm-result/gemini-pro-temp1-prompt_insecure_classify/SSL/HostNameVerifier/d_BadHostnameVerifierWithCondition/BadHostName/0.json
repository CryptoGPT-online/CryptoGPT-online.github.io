This means that the server's cipher suite selection is not being validated, which could allow an attacker to negotiate a weak cipher suite and intercept or decrypt communications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a HostNameVerifier that validates the server's cipher suite selection. For example, the following HostNameVerifier will only allow connections that use a cipher suite that is at least 128 bits strong:"
