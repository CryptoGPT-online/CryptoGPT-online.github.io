[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)", "description": "The code uses a less-secure algorithm during negotiation by allowing any cipher suite with a length greater than or equal to 0. This can lead to downgrade attacks, where an attacker can force the use of a weak cipher suite.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm during negotiation, such as TLS 1.3 with AEAD cipher suites."}]
