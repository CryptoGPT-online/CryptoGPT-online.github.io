    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}",
    "description": "The code overrides the default hostname verifier and always returns true, which means that any hostname will be accepted. This is insecure because it allows for man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can intercept the connection and impersonate the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that validates the hostname against a trusted certificate authority (CA)."
