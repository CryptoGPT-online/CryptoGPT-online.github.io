    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...} is used to verify the hostname and SSLSession",
    "description": "The code overrides the `verify` method of `HostnameVerifier` and always returns `true`, which means that any hostname and SSL session will be considered valid. This is a security risk because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept the communication between the client and the server and impersonate the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that validates the hostname and SSL session according to the security requirements."
