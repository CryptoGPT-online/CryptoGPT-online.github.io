    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){ ... }",
    "description": "The code is using a custom HostNameVerifier that always returns true, which means that it will accept any certificate presented by the server, regardless of its validity. This is a security risk because it could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and intercept communications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper HostNameVerifier that checks the validity of the server's certificate."
