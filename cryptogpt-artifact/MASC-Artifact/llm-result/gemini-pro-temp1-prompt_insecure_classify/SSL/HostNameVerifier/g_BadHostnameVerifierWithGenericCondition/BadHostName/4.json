    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}",
    "description": "The code overrides the default hostname verifier, which is used to verify the hostname of the server in SSL connections. The overridden verifier always returns true, which means that any hostname will be accepted, regardless of whether it matches the hostname in the server's certificate. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and intercept communications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that checks the hostname of the server against the hostname in the server's certificate."
