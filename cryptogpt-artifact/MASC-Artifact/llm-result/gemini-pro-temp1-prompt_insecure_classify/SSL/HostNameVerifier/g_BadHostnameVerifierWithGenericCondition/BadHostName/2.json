[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}", "description": "The code snippet overrides the default hostname verifier and always returns true, which means that any hostname will be accepted. This can lead to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, where an attacker can impersonate a trusted website and intercept communications between the client and the server.", "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that checks the hostname against a trusted list or uses a certificate authority to verify the server's identity."}]
