[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)", "description": "This code is vulnerable to the Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation because it unconditionally accepts any cipher suite, including weak or insecure ones. This could allow an attacker to downgrade the security of the connection to a less secure algorithm, making it easier to intercept or decrypt the communication.", "recommendation": "The code should be modified to only accept secure cipher suites. For example, it could use the following code: `if (session.getCipherSuite().equals(\"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\")) { return true; }`"}, {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)", "description": "This code is vulnerable to the Inadequate Encryption Strength because it does not ensure that the cipher suite used has sufficient encryption strength. An attacker could use a weak cipher suite to decrypt the communication, compromising the confidentiality of the data.", "recommendation": "The code should be modified to only accept cipher suites that provide sufficient encryption strength. For example, it could use the following code: `if (session.getCipherSuite().equals(\"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\")) { return true; }`"}, {"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)", "description": "This code is vulnerable to the Improper Certificate Validation because it does not properly validate the server's certificate. An attacker could present a fake or expired certificate, which could allow them to impersonate the server and intercept or decrypt the communication.", "recommendation": "The code should be modified to properly validate the server's certificate.
