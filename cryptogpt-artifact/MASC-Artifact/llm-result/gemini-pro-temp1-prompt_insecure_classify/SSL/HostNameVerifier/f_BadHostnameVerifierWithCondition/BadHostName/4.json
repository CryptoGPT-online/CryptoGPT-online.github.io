    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
    "description": "This code checks if the length of the cipher suite is greater than or equal to 0, which is not a meaningful check for cipher suite strength. Cipher suite strength should be checked using appropriate cryptographic libraries and algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographic library to check the strength of the cipher suite, such as the `CipherSuite.getAlgorithm()` method in Java."
