    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){....}",
    "description": "The code uses an anonymous class that implements the `HostnameVerifier` interface to verify the hostname and SSL session. However, the verification logic is weak as it always returns `true` if the `CipherSuite` length is greater than or equal to 0. This can lead to accepting insecure connections and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a proper hostname verification mechanism that checks the hostname against a trusted list or uses other validation techniques."
