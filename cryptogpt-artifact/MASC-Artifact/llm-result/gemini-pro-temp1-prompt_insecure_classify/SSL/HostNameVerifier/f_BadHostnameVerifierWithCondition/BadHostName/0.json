    "vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
    "description": "The code is using a weak check to determine the security of the cipher suite. It checks if the length of the cipher suite string is greater than or equal to 0, which is not a valid check for cipher suite security.",
    "recommendation": "The code should use a more robust check to determine the security of the cipher suite, such as checking for specific supported cipher suites or using a library that provides this functionality."
