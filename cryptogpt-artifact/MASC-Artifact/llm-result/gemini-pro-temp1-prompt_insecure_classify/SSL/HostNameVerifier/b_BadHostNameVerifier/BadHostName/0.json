    "description": "This code creates a custom HostnameVerifier that always returns true, effectively disabling certificate validation. This is insecure as it allows connections to servers with invalid or expired certificates.",
    "recommendation": "Use the default HostnameVerifier provided by the JVM or implement a custom verifier that performs proper certificate validation."
