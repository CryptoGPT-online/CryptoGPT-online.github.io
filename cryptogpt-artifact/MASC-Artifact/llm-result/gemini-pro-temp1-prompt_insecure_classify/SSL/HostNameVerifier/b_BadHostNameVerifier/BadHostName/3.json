    "vulnerable_code": "new HostnameVerifier(){...}",
    "description": "The code is using a custom hostname verifier that always returns true, which means that it will accept any certificate presented by the server, regardless of its validity. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and intercept sensitive data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that validates the server's certificate against a trusted certificate authority."
