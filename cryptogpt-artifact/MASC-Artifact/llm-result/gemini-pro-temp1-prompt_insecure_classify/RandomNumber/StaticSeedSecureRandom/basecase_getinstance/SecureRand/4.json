    "description": "The code uses the same seed value for both `rand1` and `rand2`, which means that the generated random numbers will be predictable and not truly random.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, use a secure random number generator (such as `SecureRandom`) and generate a new seed value for each instance."
