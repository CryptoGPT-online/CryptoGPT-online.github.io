    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "vulnerable_code": "rand1.setSeed(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed seed to initialize the `SecureRandom` instance, which makes the generated random numbers predictable. This can be a security risk if the random numbers are used for cryptographic purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and seed it with a truly random source, such as `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows."
