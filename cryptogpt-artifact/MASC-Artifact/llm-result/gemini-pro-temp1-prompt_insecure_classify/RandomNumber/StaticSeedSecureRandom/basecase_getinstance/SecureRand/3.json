    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\");\nrand1.setSeed(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The `NativePRNG` algorithm is deterministic, which means that if the seed is known, then the output of the random number generator is also known. This makes it unsuitable for use in security-sensitive applications.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA1PRNG\")`, which is based on a cryptographic hash function."
