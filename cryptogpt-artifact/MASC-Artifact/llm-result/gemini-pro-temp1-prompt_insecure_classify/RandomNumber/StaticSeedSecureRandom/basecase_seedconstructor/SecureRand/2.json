    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] seedBytes = \"Seed\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);",
    "description": "The code uses a fixed seed value to initialize the `SecureRandom` instances, which makes the generated random numbers predictable and less secure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and provide a truly random seed value, such as from `/dev/urandom` or a hardware-based RNG."
