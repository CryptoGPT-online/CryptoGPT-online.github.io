    "vulnerable_code": "byte[] seedBytes = \"Seed\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n\nSecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that generates random numbers. The PRNG is seeded with a byte array, and the seed is used to generate a sequence of random numbers. In this case, the seed is the same for both SecureRandom instances, which means that the random numbers generated by both instances will be the same.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, you should use a different seed for each SecureRandom instance. This can be done by passing a different byte array to the SecureRandom constructor."
