    "recommendation": "The getAcceptedIssuers method should return a non-empty array of certificates that the system can trust by default, or if the TrustManager is intended to trust all certificates (usually not recommended), then the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods should not be made void, but rather should implement proper validation."
