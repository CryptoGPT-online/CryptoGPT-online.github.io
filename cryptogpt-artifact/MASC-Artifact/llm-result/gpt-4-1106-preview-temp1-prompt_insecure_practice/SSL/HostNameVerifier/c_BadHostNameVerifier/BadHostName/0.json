  "misuse": "Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)",
  "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; }",
  "description": "This HostNameVerifier implementation will accept any SSL session without checking the host name against the certificate, making the code vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Do not use a HostNameVerifier that bypasses hostname verification. Instead, rely on the default hostname verification or implement proper validation according to your application's requirements."
