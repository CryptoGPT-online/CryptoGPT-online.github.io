        "description": "The overridden `verify` method of `HostNameVerifier` always returns true, which disables hostname verification. This makes the code vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks as it accepts any SSL certificate even if it doesn't match the hostname.",
        "recommendation": "Do not implement a HostNameVerifier that disables hostname verification. Instead, use the default hostname verification or implement proper verification logic."
