    "description": "The HostnameVerifier is implemented in such a way that it bypasses all hostname verification by always returning true. This makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks as it does not verify if the certificate hostname matches the hostname of the server.",
    "recommendation": "Implement the HostnameVerifier in a way that it properly checks that the hostname of the server matches the hostname in the certificate. Use the default HostnameVerifier or customize it to appropriately verify hostnames."
