    "vulnerable_code": "return true;",
    "description": "The HostnameVerifier is set to return true regardless of what hostname is provided, effectively bypassing hostname verification. This means that the verifier will not properly validate that the certificate presented by the server matches the expected hostname, leading to potential Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification matching the hostname against the CN (Common Name) or SAN (Subject Alternative Name) of the certificate presented by the server."
