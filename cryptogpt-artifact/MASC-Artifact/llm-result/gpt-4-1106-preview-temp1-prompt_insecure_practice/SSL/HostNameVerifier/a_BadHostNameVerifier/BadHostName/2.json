    "description": "The overridden `verify` method of `HostnameVerifier` always returns true, which disables hostname verification. This allows man-in-the-middle attacks as it accepts any SSL certificate even if it does not match the hostname of the target server.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by checking that the server's hostname matches the hostname in the server's SSL/TLS certificate."
