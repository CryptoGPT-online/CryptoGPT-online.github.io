        "description": "This code snippet disables hostname verification, which is a critical part of SSL/TLS protection. By always returning true, it accepts any hostname, even if it doesn't match the certificate presented by the server, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement a proper hostname verification mechanism that checks the server's certificate matches the hostname of the server being connected to."
