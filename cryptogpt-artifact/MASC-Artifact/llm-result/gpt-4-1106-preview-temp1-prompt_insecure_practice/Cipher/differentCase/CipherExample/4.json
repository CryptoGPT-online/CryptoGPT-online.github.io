    "description": "DES is considered a broken encryption algorithm due to its 56-bit key space which can be brute-forced relatively easily with modern hardware.",

    "misuse": "Unspecified Encryption Mode and Padding",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"des\")",
    "description": "By not specifying an encryption mode and padding scheme, the crypto API uses a default which could be insecure like ECB mode for block ciphers, which may lead to security vulnerabilities like pattern leakage for identical blocks of plaintext.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a secure mode (such as CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM) along with an appropriate padding scheme (like PKCS5Padding or PKCS7Padding) when initializing the Cipher instance. For example, use 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding'."
