    "description": "By not specifying the mode of operation and padding, the code defaults to ECB mode which is insecure for encrypting more than one block of data because it does not use an IV (Initialization Vector) and identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to identical ciphertext blocks.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a mode of operation that uses an IV, such as CBC, and ensure that a secure padding scheme like PKCS5Padding is used."
