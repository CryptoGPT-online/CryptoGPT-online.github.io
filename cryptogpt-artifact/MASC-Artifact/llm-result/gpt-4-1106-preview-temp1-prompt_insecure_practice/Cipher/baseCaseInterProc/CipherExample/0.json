        "description": "When operating in block cipher modes that require an IV (like CBC mode), failing to specify an IV or using a predictable IV can lead to vulnerabilities. While the DES algorithm by itself in ECB mode doesn't use an IV, if it were modified to use a mode that does (like CBC), using a predictable IV would be a serious flaw.",
        "recommendation": "Always provide a secure random IV when initializing ciphers in modes that require an IV (apart from ECB), even though the current code does not demonstrate the generation or use of an IV. Also, consider using more secure cipher algorithms."
