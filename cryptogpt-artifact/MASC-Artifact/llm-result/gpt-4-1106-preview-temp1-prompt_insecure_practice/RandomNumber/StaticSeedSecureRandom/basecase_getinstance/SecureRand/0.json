        "description": "Using a static seed value for SecureRandom's setSeed method defeats the purpose of using a SecureRandom which should be unpredictable. Two instances of SecureRandom that are seeded with the same value will produce the same sequence of numbers, which can be a severe security risk if used for cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid setting a predictable static seed for SecureRandom; allow it to self-seed from an unpredictable entropy source. If you need reproducible results for testing, consider using a different approach that does not compromise security in production."
