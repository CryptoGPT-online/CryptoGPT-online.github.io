    "description": "Setting the same seed on two instances of SecureRandom `rand1` and `rand2` will produce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers. This can reduce the randomness and security of the values produced by the SecureRandom instances in contexts where predictability is a security concern.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the manual seed initialization to allow SecureRandom to self-seed with a unpredictable value or use a stronger, ideally non-deterministic method to generate a seed."

    "recommendation": "Prefer a more consistently secure random number generator, such as 'SHA1PRNG' when possible, or use the platform's default if it offers adequate security."
