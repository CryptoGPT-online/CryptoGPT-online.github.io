"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\")",
"description": "The cipher instance is using the AES/GCM/NoPadding algorithm, which is considered broken and risky. GCM is a stream cipher mode that is not semantically secure, and it can be vulnerable to attacks such as the Bellare-Neven attack. Additionally, NoPadding is a weak padding scheme that can lead to padding oracle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure cipher suite, such as AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding or AES/GCM/PKCS5Padding, and make sure to use a secure padding scheme such as PKCS5Padding."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(c.toString())",
"description": "The code is logging the cipher instance, which may contain sensitive information such as the encryption key. It is important to validate the certificate of the cipher instance to ensure that it is trusted and not compromised.",
"recommendation": "Validate the certificate of the cipher instance using a trusted certificate authority and log only the necessary information."
