 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\")",
"description": "The use of AES/GCM/NoPadding algorithm is considered broken and risky due to its usage of a hardcoded initialization vector (IV) and lack of proper key management.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm that generates a random IV for each encryption operation, such as AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding, and properly manage the encryption key using a secure key management system."
