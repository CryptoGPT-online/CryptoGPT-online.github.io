        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"DE$S\".replace(\"$\", \"\"));",
        "description": "The Cipher instance is created with the algorithm \"DES\", which is a weak encryption algorithm and should not be used. DES has a 56-bit key, which is considered too short and vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Additionally, DES is outdated and has been replaced by newer and more secure algorithms such as AES.",
        "recommendation": "Replace the use of DES with a more secure algorithm such as AES. AES has a larger key size, typically 128 bits or higher, and is considered more secure against brute-force attacks."
