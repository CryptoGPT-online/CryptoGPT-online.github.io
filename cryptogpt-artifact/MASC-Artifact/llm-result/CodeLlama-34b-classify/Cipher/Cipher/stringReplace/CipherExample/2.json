        "description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure. It uses a small key size (56 bits) and is susceptible to brute force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, with a larger key size (at least 128 bits) and a secure mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM."
