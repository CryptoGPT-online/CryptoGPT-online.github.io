        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\").replace(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\", \"DES\")",
        "description": "The code uses the Cipher class to get an instance of the \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\" transformation, but then replaces the transformation with \"DES\", which is a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm. DES should not be used for new applications, as it has been superseded by AES and other more secure algorithms.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the code should be updated to use a secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithm, such as AES with a strong key size and a secure mode of operation, and to avoid using broken or risky algorithms like DES."
