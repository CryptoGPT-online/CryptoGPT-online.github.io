 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\".replace(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\", \"DES\"));",
"description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for new implementations. DES has a 64-bit key, which is too small for secure encryption. AES, on the other hand, has a 128-bit key and is considered secure. The code should be updated to use AES.",
"recommendation": "Update the code to use AES instead of DES. Use a secure key length, such as 128-bit or 256-bit."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "System.out.println(c.toString());",
"description": "The code prints the cipher object to the console, which includes the algorithm and key size. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the implementation, which could be used by an attacker to compromise the security of the system.",
"recommendation": "Do not print sensitive information, such as the cipher object, to the console or any other output stream."
