        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\").replace(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\", \"DES\")",
        "description": "The code uses the `replace` method to change the cipher algorithm from AES/GCM/NoPadding to DES. DES is a weak and broken encryption algorithm that should not be used for new development. It has a small key size of 64 bits, which makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
