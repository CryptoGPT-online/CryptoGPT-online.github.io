"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\".replace(\"A\", \"D\"))",
"description": "The code uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, specifically the 'D' version of the AES algorithm. This is because the 'D' version is not a standard algorithm, and it is not secure to use it for encryption purposes. Additionally, the algorithm is not randomly generated, which makes it vulnerable to pre-computation attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and standard cryptographic algorithm, such as the 'CBC' mode of the AES algorithm, and make sure to use a randomly generated key and initialization vector."
