        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"des\");",
        "description": "The code uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used in new work. The algorithm uses a 56-bit key, which can be brute-forced in a few hours with a simple computer.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as AES, with a key length of at least 128 bits. Also, avoid using hardcoded keys and use a secure key exchange mechanism to distribute the keys."
