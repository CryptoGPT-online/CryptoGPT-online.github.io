        "description": "The SecureRandom class is initialized with a seed that is derived from a hardcoded string. This is a predictable seed, which makes it possible for an attacker to predict the random values generated by the SecureRandom instance.",
        "recommendation": "Use a stronger, unpredictable seed for the SecureRandom instance, such as a random number generated by the operating system or a hardware random number generator."
