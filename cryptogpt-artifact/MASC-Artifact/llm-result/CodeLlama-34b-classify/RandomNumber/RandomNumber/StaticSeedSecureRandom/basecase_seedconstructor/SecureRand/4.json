    "description": "The use of the `SecureRandom` class with a predictable seed is insecure. It allows an attacker to predict the random numbers generated, which may compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure source of randomness, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`, to generate cryptographically strong random numbers."
