        "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);",
        "description": "The IvParameterSpec class is a risky algorithm because it uses a fixed initialization vector (IV) that is derived from a date string. This can lead to predictable and repeated initialization vectors, which can be vulnerable to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm that generates random initialization vectors, such as the SecureRandom class in Java."

        "description": "The toString() method of the Date class returns a string representation of the date, which may not be sufficiently random for cryptographic use. This can lead to predictable and repeated values, which can be vulnerable to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure random value generation algorithm, such as the SecureRandom class in Java."

        "description": "The IvParameterSpec class uses a fixed initialization vector (IV) with a length of 8 bytes, which is too short for secure encryption. This can make the encryption vulnerable to attacks.",

        "description": "The IvParameterSpec class uses a risky algorithm that is not recommended for cryptographic use. This can make the encryption vulnerable to attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a secure key length and a random initialization vector."
