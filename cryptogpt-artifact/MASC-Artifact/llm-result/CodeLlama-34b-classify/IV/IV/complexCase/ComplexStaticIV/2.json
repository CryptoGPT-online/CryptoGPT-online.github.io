 Here is the JSON output with the identified security issues and their explanations:

[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);",
    "description": "The use of a static IV is insecure as it can be easily predicted by an attacker, allowing them to potentially decrypt the encrypted data. It is recommended to use a random IV for each encryption operation.",
    "recommendation": "Use a random IV for each encryption operation. It can be generated using a secure random number generator, such as the Java SecureRandom class."
