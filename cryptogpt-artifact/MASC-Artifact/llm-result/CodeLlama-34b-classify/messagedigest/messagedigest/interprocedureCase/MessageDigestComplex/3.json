        "description": "The `A()` and `B()` methods set the `digestName` field to \"SHA-256\" and then \"MD5\" respectively. The `getName()` method returns the value of `digestName`, which is then used to select the message digest algorithm. This is vulnerable to downgrade attacks, where an attacker could trick the system into using a weaker algorithm, such as MD5.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm selection mechanism, such as the `MessageDigest.getInstance()` method with a hardcoded algorithm name, or use a secure negotiation protocol, such as TLS."
