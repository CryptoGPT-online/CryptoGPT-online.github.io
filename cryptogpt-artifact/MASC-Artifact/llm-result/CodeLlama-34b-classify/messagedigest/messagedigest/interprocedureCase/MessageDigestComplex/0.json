 The code sample you provided contains several security misuses related to cryptography. Here is a list of these misuses and how they can be fixed:

1. Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327):
The code uses the "MD5" algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purpose. Instead, a more secure algorithm such as "SHA-256" or "SHA-512" should be used.

Vulnerable code:
```java
digestName = "MD5";
```
Fix:
```java
digestName = "SHA-256";
```
2. Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):
The code does not validate the certificate of the cryptographic algorithm provider. This could allow an attacker to use a fake certificate to masquerade as a trusted provider and intercept the cryptographic data.

Vulnerable code:
```java
cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName());
```
Fix:
```java
cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName(), true);
```
3. Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE-330):
The code uses a hardcoded salt value, which can be easily guessed and brute-forced by an attacker. Instead, a more secure approach would be to generate a random salt value for each encryption operation.

Vulnerable code:
```java
digestName = "SHA-256";
```
Fix:
```java
digestName = "SHA-256";
salt = new byte[32];
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
random.nextBytes(salt);
```
4. Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326):
The code uses a low key length (256 bits) for the encryption key. This could allow an attacker to perform a successful key recovery attack and decrypt the encrypted data.

Vulnerable code:
```java
digestName = "SHA-256";
```
Fix:
```java
digestName = "SHA-512";
```
5. Use of Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798):
The code hardcodes the encryption key in the source code, which can be easily discovered and extracted by an attacker. Instead, a more secure approach would be to store the encryption key in a secure location, such as a secure database or a secure file, and only use it when it is needed.

Vulnerable code:
```java
private static final String ENCRYPTION_KEY = "mysecretkey";
```
Fix:
```java
// Load the encryption key from a secure location
String encryptionKey = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("encryptionKeyFile")));
```
6. Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation (CWE-757):
The code uses a less secure algorithm for the encryption negotiation. Instead, a more secure algorithm such as "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384" should be used.

Vulnerable code:
```java
cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName(), true);
```
Fix:
```java
cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384", true);
```
In summary, the code sample contains several security misuses related to cryptography, including the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, improper certificate validation, use of insufficiently random values, inadequate encryption strength, use of hardcoded credentials, and selection of less-secure algorithm during negotiation. These misuses can be fixed by using a more secure cryptographic algorithm, validating certificates, generating random salts, using a stronger encryption key, storing encryption keys in a secure location, and selecting a more secure algorithm for encryption negotiation.
