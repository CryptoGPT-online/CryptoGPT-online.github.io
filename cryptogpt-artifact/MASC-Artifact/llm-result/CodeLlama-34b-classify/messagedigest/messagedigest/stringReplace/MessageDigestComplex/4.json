"description": "The use of MD5 as a cryptographic hash algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for any security related purposes. It has been shown to be vulnerable to collisions, which can lead to attacks such as hash flooding and collision attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure and modern cryptographic hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, instead of MD5."
