"description": "The use of MD5 as a cryptographic hash function is considered broken and should not be used for any security-related purposes. It is vulnerable to collisions and can be easily cracked.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, instead of MD5."

"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD$5\".replace(\"$\", \"\"))",
"description": "The use of the MD5 algorithm without proper security considerations can lead to insecure negotiation and potential attacks.",
"recommendation": "Implement secure negotiation mechanisms and use a secure algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, for hashing purposes."
