        "description": "The code uses the MessageDigest.getInstance() method to create an instance of a cryptographic hash function. However, it uses the replace() method to replace the algorithm name \"SHA-256\" with \"MD5\", which is a broken and insecure algorithm.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, and avoid using broken or insecure algorithms like MD5."
