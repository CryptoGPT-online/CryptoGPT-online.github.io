"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"MD5\"))",
"description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. The use of MD5 in this context can lead to collision attacks and other security vulnerabilities.",
"recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, or a keyed hash function like HMAC-SHA-256."
