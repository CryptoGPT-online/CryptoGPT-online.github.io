        "description": "The code is using the MD5 algorithm, which is broken and should not be used for any cryptographic purpose. It is also using the SHA-256 algorithm in a way that is not secure, as it is using a hardcoded key. This can lead to weak encryption and potential attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-3 or SHA-2 with a secure key generation method such as PBKDF2."
