 {
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")",
"description": "The code uses the MD5 hash algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for secure applications. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and should be replaced with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-2.",
"recommendation": "Replace the use of MD5 with a more secure algorithm such as SHA-2."
