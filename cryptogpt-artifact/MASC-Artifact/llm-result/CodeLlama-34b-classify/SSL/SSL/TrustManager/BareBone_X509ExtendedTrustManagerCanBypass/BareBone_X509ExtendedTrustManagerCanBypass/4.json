        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "The code is not validating the certificates properly. The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods are empty, which means that any certificate will be accepted without validation.",
        "description": "The `X509ExtendedTrustManager` class is used to manage the trusted certificates for a specific context. The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods are used to validate the certificates for a specific context. However, in the provided code, these methods are empty, which means that any certificate will be accepted without validation. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, as an attacker could potentially use a certificate that is not trusted by the application.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the code should be modified to properly validate the certificates. This can be done by adding code to the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods to validate the certificates using a trusted certificate store, or by using a library that provides a more secure implementation of the `X509ExtendedTrustManager` class."
