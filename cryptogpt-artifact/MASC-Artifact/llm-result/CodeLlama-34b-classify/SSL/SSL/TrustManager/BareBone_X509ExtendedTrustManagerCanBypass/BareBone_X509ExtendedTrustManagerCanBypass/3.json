        "vulnerable_code": "new X509ExtendedTrustManager()",
        "description": "The code is using the `X509ExtendedTrustManager` class, which is a deprecated class that uses a hardcoded public key to verify the authenticity of the server certificate. This is a risky practice, as it allows any certificate to be trusted, regardless of whether it has been revoked or not.",
        "recommendation": "Instead, use the `X509TrustManager` class, which allows you to specify the trust anchor store and the host name verifier. This ensures that only certificates that have been issued by a trusted certificate authority and are valid for the hostname being accessed are trusted."

        "description": "The code is printing a hardcoded message to the console. This is a potential security issue, as it may expose sensitive information or allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.",
        "recommendation": "Instead, use a secure method of communication, such as a secure shell (SSH) or a virtual private network (VPN), to encrypt the communication between the system and the user."
