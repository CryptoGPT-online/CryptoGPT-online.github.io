        "description": "The `getAcceptedIssuers()` method returns `null`, which means that no certificates are accepted for trust. This is a potential security issue, as it may allow any certificate to be trusted.",
        "recommendation": "The `getAcceptedIssuers()` method should be implemented to return a list of trusted certificates. The `checkServerTrusted()` and `checkClientTrusted()` methods should also be implemented to validate the server and client certificates respectively."
