        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "checkServerTrusted() and checkClientTrusted() methods",
        "description": "The certificate validation is not properly implemented in the `getTrustmanager()` method. The `getAcceptedIssuers()` method returns `null`, which means that the `checkServerTrusted()` and `checkClientTrusted()` methods will not perform any validation on the certificate chain. This can lead to potential security issues, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation in the `getTrustmanager()` method by populating the `getAcceptedIssuers()` method with a list of trusted certificate authorities and using the `checkServerTrusted()` and `checkClientTrusted()` methods to validate the certificate chain."
