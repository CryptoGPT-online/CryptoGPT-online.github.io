        "description": "The getX509TrustManager() method trusts any certificate, regardless of its validity or trustworthiness, which can lead to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The method should validate the certificate's issuing authority and expiration date.",

        "recommendation": "Use the `TLSv1.2` protocol instead of `SSL` for secure communication."
