        "vulnerable_code": "Ir.java",
        "description": "The `Ir` class uses the `X509TrustManager` interface, which is a legacy interface that may use weak or broken cryptographic algorithms for certificate validation. Additionally, the `Ir` class does not provide any information about the specific algorithm used for certificate validation.",
        "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure and updated cryptographic library or interface, such as the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) or the Bouncy Castle library."
