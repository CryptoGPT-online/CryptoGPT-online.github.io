 Here is the JSON output:

[
{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "new ITrustManager()",
"description": "The use of `ITrustManager` as a trust manager in Java is a less secure approach than using a standard trust manager implementation, such as `X509TrustManager`. This is because `ITrustManager` does not provide a mechanism for negotiating the use of a secure algorithm, and may result in the use of a less secure algorithm, such as an older version of SSL or TLS, which could be vulnerable to attack.",
"recommendation": "Use a standard trust manager implementation, such as `X509TrustManager`, to ensure the use of a secure algorithm during negotiation."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "getAcceptedIssuers()",
"description": "The `getAcceptedIssuers()` method is not being used to validate the certificate chain, and the `checkClientTrusted()` and `checkServerTrusted()` methods are not being used to validate the certificate chain.",
"recommendation": "Use the `getAcceptedIssuers()` method to validate the certificate chain, and use the `checkClientTrusted()` and `checkServerTrusted()` methods to validate the certificate chain."
