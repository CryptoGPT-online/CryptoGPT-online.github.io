        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "checkClientTrusted, checkServerTrusted",
        "description": "The certificate validation is not properly implemented. The `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods should validate the certificate chain and throw a `CertificateException` if the certificate is not valid.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation using a trusted certificate authority (CA) and a revocation list."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_code": "getAcceptedIssuers",
        "description": "The `getAcceptedIssuers` method returns an empty array of `X509Certificate` objects, which means that any certificate issued by any CA is accepted. This can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker can present a fake certificate to the client and impersonate the server.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper list of trusted certificate authorities and validate the certificate chain properly."
