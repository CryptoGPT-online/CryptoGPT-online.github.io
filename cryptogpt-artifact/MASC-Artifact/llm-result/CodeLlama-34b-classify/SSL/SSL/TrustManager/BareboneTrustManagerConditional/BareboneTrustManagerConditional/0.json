{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "X509TrustManager",
"description": "The X509TrustManager implementation in this code always returns an empty array of X509Certificate, which means that any certificate will be accepted without validation. This can lead to a potential Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.",
"recommendation": "Replace the X509TrustManager implementation with a proper one that validates certificates before accepting them."
