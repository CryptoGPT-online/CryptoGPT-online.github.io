        "vulnerable_code": "checkClientTrusted() and checkServerTrusted() methods",
        "description": "The trustAll TrustManager implementation does not verify the validity of the certificates, it only checks if the certificate is of type RSA and has a length of at least 314 bytes. This is a vulnerability because it allows any certificate, even if it is not valid or trusted, to be used for encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper Certificate Validation algorithm, such as the one provided by the Java Security API."

        "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom() constructor without a seed",
        "description": "The SecureRandom() constructor is used to create a random number generator, but it does not take any seed, which can lead to predictable random numbers. This can be a vulnerability because it can allow an attacker to predict the random values and use them to compromise the encryption.",

        "description": "The trustAll TrustManager implementation has a hardcoded string constant \"RSA\", which is used to check if the certificate is of type RSA. This is a vulnerability because it allows an attacker to easily detect and bypass the trustAll TrustManager.",
