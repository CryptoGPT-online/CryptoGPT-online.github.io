        "description": "The `BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass` class is not secure because it hardcodes a trust manager that accepts all certificates. This means that any certificate presented by the server will be accepted without verification, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure trust manager that verifies the authenticity of the server's certificate."
