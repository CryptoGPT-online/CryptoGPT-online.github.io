        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "new BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass();",
        "description": "The code uses a custom trust manager that does not perform any validation of the server's certificate. This can lead to a vulnerability known as a 'man-in-the-middle' attack, where an attacker can intercept the communication between the client and the server and eavesdrop, tamper with, or even generate fraudulent data.",
        "recommendation": "Use a trusted and validated certificate for the server, and implement proper certificate validation in the client code to ensure the authenticity of the server."
