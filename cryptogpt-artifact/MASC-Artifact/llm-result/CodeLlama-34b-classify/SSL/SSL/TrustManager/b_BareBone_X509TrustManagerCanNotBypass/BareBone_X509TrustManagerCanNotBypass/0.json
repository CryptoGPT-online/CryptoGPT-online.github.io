        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass",
        "description": "The certificate validation in the BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass class is not adequate, as it does not verify the server's certificate properly. This can lead to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the server and presents a fake certificate as if it were from the legitimate server.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation mechanism that checks the certificate's expiration date, issuing CA, and subject alternative names (SANs) to ensure that the certificate is valid and belongs to the legitimate server."
