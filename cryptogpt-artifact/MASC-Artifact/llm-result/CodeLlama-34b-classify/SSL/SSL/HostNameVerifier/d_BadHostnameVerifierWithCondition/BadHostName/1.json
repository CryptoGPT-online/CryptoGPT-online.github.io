{
"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)",
"description": "The code is always returning true, regardless of the certificate being valid or not. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Implement a proper certificate validation mechanism, such as checking the certificate chain and expiration date."

{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
"description": "The code is using a weak cryptographic algorithm (hardcoded length of cipher suite) to verify the certificate, which is easily brute-forced. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"recommendation": "Use a proper and secure cryptographic algorithm to verify the certificate, such as checking the certificate chain and expiration date."
