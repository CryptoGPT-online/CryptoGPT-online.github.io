 {
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
"description": "The code selects a cipher suite based on its length, which can lead to the use of a weaker encryption algorithm. This can compromise the security of the communication.",
"recommendation": "Implement a more robust algorithm selection mechanism, such as using the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) to select the appropriate algorithm based on the available information."
