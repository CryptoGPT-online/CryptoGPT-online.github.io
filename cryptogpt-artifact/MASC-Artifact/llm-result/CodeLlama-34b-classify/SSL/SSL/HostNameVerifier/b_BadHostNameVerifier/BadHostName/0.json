        "description": "The code uses a custom `HostnameVerifier` that always returns `true`, which allows the connection to be established with any SSL/TLS server, regardless of the hostname. This creates a vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept the communication and impersonate the server.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure `HostnameVerifier` implementation, such as the one provided by the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), to ensure that the connection is established with the expected server."
