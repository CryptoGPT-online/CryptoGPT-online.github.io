        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "return true;",
        "description": "The `HostnameVerifier` interface is used to verify the hostname of the SSL/TLS server during the handshake process. The `verify` method is called with the hostname and the `SSLSession` object. However, the current implementation always returns `true`, which means that it does not perform any validation of the hostname. This allows an attacker to use a fake certificate to impersonate the legitimate server and intercept the communication.",
        "recommendation": "The `HostnameVerifier` implementation should be updated to perform proper validation of the hostname. This can be done by comparing the hostname with the subject of the certificate or by using a public suffix list to verify that the hostname is a valid domain name."
