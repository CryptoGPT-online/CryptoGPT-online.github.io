        "description": "The `HostnameVerifier` interface is implemented with a hardcoded `return true` statement, which allows any hostname to be verified. This implementation is insecure because it does not verify the hostname and allows any hostname to be used, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure implementation of the `HostnameVerifier` interface that verifies the hostname and ensures that the certificate presented by the server matches the expected hostname."
