        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "return true",
        "description": "The custom HostNameVerifier implementation always returns true, which means that it does not verify the certificate at all. This is a vulnerability because it allows for man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the communication between the client and the server.",
        "recommendation": "Use a proper HostNameVerifier implementation that verifies the certificate, such as the default implementation in the Java SSL/TLS implementation."
