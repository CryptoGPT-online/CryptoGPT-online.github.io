        "description": "The code hardcodes a value of `true` for the `HostNameVerifier` interface, which allows any hostname to be verified without checking the certificate. This is a security vulnerability as it allows an attacker to impersonate the intended server.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded value and use a more secure method to verify the hostname, such as using the `javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier` class."
