        "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}",
        "description": "The code uses a HostNameVerifier to verify the hostname of an SSL session. However, the implementation of the HostNameVerifier is not secure, as it always returns true, regardless of the hostname and SSL session provided. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a trusted host and intercept the communication between the client and the server.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure implementation of HostNameVerifier, such as the one provided by the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), to verify the hostname of an SSL session."
