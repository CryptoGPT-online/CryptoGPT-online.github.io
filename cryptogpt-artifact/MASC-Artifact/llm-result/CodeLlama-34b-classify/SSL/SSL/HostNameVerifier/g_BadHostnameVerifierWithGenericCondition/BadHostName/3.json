 {
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}",
"description": "The hostname verifier is always returning true, which means it will accept any certificate regardless of the hostname. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker could potentially use a self-signed certificate or a certificate from an untrusted CA to impersonate the server.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure hostname verifier that checks the hostname against the certificate's subject alternative names (SANs) or common name (CN) to ensure the certificate is valid for the given hostname. Alternatively, you can use a library that provides a secure hostname verifier implementation."
