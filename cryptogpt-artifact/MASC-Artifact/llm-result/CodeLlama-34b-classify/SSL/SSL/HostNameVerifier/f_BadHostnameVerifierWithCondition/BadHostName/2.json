{
"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
"vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
"description": "The SSL/TLS cipher suite negotiation is done insecurely by checking the length of the cipher suite instead of the actual cipher suite itself. This can allow an attacker to downgrade the connection to a less secure cipher suite, making it easier for them to intercept and decrypt the data.",
"recommendation": "Use a secure negotiation method, such as TLS 1.2 or higher, and avoid using the length of the cipher suite as a determining factor for cipher suite selection."
