        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
        "description": "The code is not properly verifying the certificate used by the SSL/TLS connection. By checking the length of the cipher suite, the code is not checking whether the certificate is trusted or not, which can lead to a vulnerability known as 'Man-in-the-middle' attack.",
        "recommendation": "To fix this misuse, the code should check the certificate's validity and use a trusted certificate authority to verify it. The code should also use a secure protocol such as HTTPS instead of plain HTTP."
