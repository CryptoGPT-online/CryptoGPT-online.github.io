  ],
  "description": "The implemented methods 'checkClientTrusted' and 'checkServerTrusted' of X509TrustManager do not throw any exceptions or perform any certificate chain validation. This can lead to trusting any certificate presented during SSL/TLS negotiations, which makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation in 'checkClientTrusted' and 'checkServerTrusted' methods. It is important to check that the presented certificate is trusted by examining if it is issued by a trusted CA and that the certificate chain is valid."
