    "description": "The X509TrustManager implemented does not perform any validation when checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are called. This allows any certificate, either valid or not, to be trusted which makes the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",

    "description": "The getAcceptedIssuers method returns an empty array, meaning no issuers are trusted, which in practice means that the trust manager does not use any trust anchor to validate the certificate chain.",
