    "description": "While SecureRandom generally provides sufficient randomness, it should be ensured that SecureRandom is properly initialized and not using a predictable seed. As there is no seed shown in the code, it's presumed to be secure, if SecureRandom is properly implemented on the platform. Additionally, cryptographic operations should ensure that random values/IVs are appropriately used when required.",

Note: The second misuse regarding SecureRandom may not be a misuse at all; the note is based on a general best-practice assumption since there are no specifics in the seeded value in the provided code. The SecureRandom instance is initialized without a specified seed and is expected to be safe, but we cannot be sure without seeing more of the system's code and its context.
