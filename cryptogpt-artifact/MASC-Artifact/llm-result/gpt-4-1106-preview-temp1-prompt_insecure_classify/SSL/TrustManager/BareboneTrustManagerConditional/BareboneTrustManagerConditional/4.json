        "description": "The X509TrustManager implemented in the code does not validate certificate chains properly, allowing any certificate regardless of its issuing authority. Both checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods do not perform any validation, throwing an exception only if the AuthType is not RSA. getAcceptedIssuers method returns an empty array, effectively disabling certificate chain validation.",
