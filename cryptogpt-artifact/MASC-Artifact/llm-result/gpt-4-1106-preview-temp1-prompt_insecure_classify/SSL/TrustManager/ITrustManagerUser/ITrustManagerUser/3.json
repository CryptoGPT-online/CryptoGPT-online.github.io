        "description": "The methods checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted are empty, which means they do not perform any certificate validation. In a real-world scenario, this would allow any certificate to be accepted without verification, leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic within checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods. Do not accept all certificates by default."
