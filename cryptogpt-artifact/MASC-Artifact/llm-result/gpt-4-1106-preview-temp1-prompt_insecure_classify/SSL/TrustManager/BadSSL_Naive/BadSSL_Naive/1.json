        "description": "The implemented 'checkServerTrusted' method does not perform any validation on the provided certificate chain, effectively allowing all server certificates, including malicious ones. This means that the TLS connection is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement certificate validation logic that checks the certificate chain against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), or use the default trust manager provided by the Java platform."

        "description": "The usage of 'SSL' as a parameter to 'getInstance' is outdated and insecure. It does not sufficiently ensure the use of a strong cryptographic protocol, and could allow deprecated SSL protocols to be negotiated.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'SSL' with 'TLS', which is the secure and recommended protocol. Specifically, specify a more recent version such as 'TLSv1.2' or 'TLSv1.3'."
