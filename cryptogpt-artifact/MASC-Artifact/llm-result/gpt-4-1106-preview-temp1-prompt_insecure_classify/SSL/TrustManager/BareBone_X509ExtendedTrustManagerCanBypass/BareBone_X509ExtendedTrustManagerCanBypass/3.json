        "vulnerable_code": "new X509ExtendedTrustManager()",
        "description": "The custom X509ExtendedTrustManager defined in the code is not actually performing any validation of the certificate chain, which means it would trust any certificate provided to it. All the methods responsible for checking if the client or server can be trusted are empty, thus bypassing any form of proper certificate validation.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic inside the overridden methods (`checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted`) that actually verify the certificate's validity, issuer, expiration, and revocation status using a trust anchor or a Certificate Authority (CA)."
