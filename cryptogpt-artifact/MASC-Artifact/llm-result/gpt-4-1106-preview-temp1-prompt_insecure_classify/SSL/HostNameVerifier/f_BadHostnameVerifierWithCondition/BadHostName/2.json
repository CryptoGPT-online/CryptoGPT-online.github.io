        "description": "This code defines a custom HostNameVerifier that always returns true, effectively disabling hostname verification. This can allow man-in-the-middle attacks because the client would accept any certificate presented by the server, regardless of the hostname it specifies.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by comparing the server's hostname with the one specified in the server's certificate subject's Common Name (CN) or one of the Subject Alternative Names (SAN)."
