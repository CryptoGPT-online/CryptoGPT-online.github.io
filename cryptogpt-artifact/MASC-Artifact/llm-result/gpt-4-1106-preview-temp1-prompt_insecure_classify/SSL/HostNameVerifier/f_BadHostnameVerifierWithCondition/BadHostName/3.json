    "description": "The HostNameVerifier method returns true regardless of what hostname is provided or what session details are, bypassing the hostname verification entirely. It will accept any SSL certificate presented by the server which makes it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Do not implement a HostNameVerifier that bypasses hostname verification. Ensure that hostname verification is properly implemented to check that the hostname from the server's certificate matches the host you intend to connect to."
