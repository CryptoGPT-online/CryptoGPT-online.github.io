    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; }",
    "description": "The verify method in the HostNameVerifier interface always returns true, which means it does not perform any hostname verification. This disables any form of SSL/TLS security checks, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement hostname verification logic in the verify method or use the default hostname verifier provided by the Java runtime, which complies with the HTTPS specification."
