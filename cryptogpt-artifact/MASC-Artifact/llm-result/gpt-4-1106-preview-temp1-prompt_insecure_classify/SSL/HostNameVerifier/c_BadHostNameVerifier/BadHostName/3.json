        "description": "The custom HostNameVerifier implementation always returns true, which means it will accept any hostname as correct for the certificate, effectively bypassing hostname verification. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Do not implement a trust manager that unconditionally accepts all hostnames. Instead, use the default hostname verifier, or implement proper hostname verification."
