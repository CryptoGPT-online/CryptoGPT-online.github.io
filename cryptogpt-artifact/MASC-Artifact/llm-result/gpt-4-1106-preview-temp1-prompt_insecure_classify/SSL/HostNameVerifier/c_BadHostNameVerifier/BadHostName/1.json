        "description": "The verify method of HostNameVerifier is set to always return true, which means it is not verifying the hostname against the certificate presented by the server. This could allow man-in-the-middle attacks because any hostname would be accepted as valid.",
        "recommendation": "Implement hostname verification by checking that the hostname matches the certificate's common name (CN) or one of the subjectAltName fields if present. Alternatively, use the default hostname verifier provided by the library."
