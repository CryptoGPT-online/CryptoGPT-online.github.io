        "description": "The HostnameVerifier is set to always return true which bypasses hostname verification, thus accepting any SSL certificate presented by the server without validation. This opens the application to man-in-the-middle attacks as it no longer assures that the server is who it claims to be.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification, by verifying that the certificate's hostname matches the server's hostname, or use the default HostnameVerifier provided by the SSL library that carries out this check."
