    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; }",
    "description": "This HostnameVerifier implementation bypasses all the hostname verification by simply returning true for any hostname or SSLSession, which makes man-in-the-middle attacks possible as it will accept any SSL certificate.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by comparing the hostname to the CN field and/or SAN fields of the certificate presented by the server in the SSLSession. Alternatively, use the default HostnameVerifier provided by the Java runtime."
