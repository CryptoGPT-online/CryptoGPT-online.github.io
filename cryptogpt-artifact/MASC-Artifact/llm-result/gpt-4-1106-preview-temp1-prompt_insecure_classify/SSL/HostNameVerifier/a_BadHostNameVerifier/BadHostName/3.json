    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; }",
    "description": "The method verify() always returns true, which disables hostname verification. This means it would trust any certificate presented by the server, even if it's not valid for the host it's supposedly issued to. Trusting all certificates makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement a proper hostname verification method that checks the SSL certificate to ensure it's valid for the requested hostname."
