        "description": "The HostnameVerifier is implemented to always return true, which means it bypasses all the hostname verification checks and accepts any SSL certificate presented without checking if it matches the hostname. This makes it susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by comparing the server's hostname with the domain name in the server's SSL certificate."
