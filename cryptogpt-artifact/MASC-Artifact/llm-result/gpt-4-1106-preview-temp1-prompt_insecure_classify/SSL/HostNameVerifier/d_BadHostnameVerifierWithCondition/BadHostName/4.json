        "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0){\n    return true;\n}",
        "description": "The verify method of HostnameVerifier always returns true, regardless of the hostname or SSLSession. This means it doesn't check if the certificate hostname matches and doesn't throw any exception for certificate mismatches. Essentially, this bypasses all hostname verification, making the SSL/TLS connection susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Remove the override of the verify method to use the default hostname verification or implement proper hostname verification logic."
