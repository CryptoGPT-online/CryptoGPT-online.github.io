        "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){\n    return true;\n}",
        "description": "This code defines an anonymous class that implements HostnameVerifier interface and always returns true, regardless of what the hostname or SSL session is. This means it will accept any SSL certificate presented by the server, which is a severe security flaw because it makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification according to the expected hostnames or by using the default hostname verifier provided by the SSL context."
