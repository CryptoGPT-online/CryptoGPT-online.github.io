        "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){\n    return true;\n}",
        "description": "The verify method of HostNameVerifier is overridden to always return true, which means it's not doing any actual verification of certificates. This makes the code susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification according to the HTTPS server's certificates. It's often best to not implement custom verifiers but to rely on the default hostname verification provided by the Java platform."
