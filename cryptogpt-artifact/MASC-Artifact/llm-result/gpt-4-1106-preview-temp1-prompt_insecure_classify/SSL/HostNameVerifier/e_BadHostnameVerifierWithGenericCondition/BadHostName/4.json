        "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){\n    return true;\n}",
        "description": "The implemented HostNameVerifier accepts any hostname as valid by always returning true, which means it does not enforce any hostname verification against the certificate presented by the server during an SSL/TLS connection. This opens the communication to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
