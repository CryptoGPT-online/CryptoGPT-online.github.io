        "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){ return true; }",
        "description": "The verify method always returns true regardless of the hostname or SSLSession, which means it does not perform any certificate validation. This could allow man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification logic to validate the certificate against the hostname. A common approach is to leverages the default hostname verifier from the javax.net.ssl package or a custom verifier that checks the hostname against the certificate subject."
