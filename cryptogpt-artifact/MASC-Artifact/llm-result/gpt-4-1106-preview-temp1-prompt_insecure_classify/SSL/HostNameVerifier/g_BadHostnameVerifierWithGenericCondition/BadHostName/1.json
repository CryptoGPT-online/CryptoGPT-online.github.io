  "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
  "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){ return true; }",
  "description": "The code implements a HostnameVerifier with a verify method that always returns true, effectively bypassing hostname verification and making it prone to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Remove the 'always true' condition and properly implement hostname validation consistent with the security policy of the application."
