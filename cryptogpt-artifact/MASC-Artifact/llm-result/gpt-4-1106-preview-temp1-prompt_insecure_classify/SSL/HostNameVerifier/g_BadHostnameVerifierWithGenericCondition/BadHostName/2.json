        "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){\n    return true;\n}",
        "description": "The code snippet always returns true for the hostname verification method, essentially disabling any form of SSL/TLS host name verification. This allows man-in-the-middle attacks because the client trusts any SSL certificate presented by the server, regardless of the hostname.",
        "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification by removing the 'true' condition and checking that the hostname matches the CN (Common Name) or SAN (Subject Alternative Names) fields of the certificate presented by the server."
