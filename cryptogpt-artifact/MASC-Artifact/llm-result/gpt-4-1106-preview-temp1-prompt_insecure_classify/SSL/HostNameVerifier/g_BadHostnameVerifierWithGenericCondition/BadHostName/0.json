    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session == null){\n    return true;\n}",
    "description": "The verifier method is implemented to return true unconditionally, which means it will accept any SSL/TLS connection regardless of the hostname. This defeats the purpose of SSL/TLS hostname verification, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement hostname verification correctly, by checking that the hostname matches the one the certificate was issued for. Consider using default hostname verifiers provided by the SSL library, if available."
