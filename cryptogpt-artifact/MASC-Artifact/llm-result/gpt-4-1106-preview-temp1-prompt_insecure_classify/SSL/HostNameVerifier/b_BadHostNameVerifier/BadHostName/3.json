        "description": "The HostnameVerifier implementation always returns true, which means it bypasses all hostname verification and accepts any certificate presented by the server. This opens up the application to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Implement a proper hostname verification mechanism according to the identity assertion provided by the server's certificate, or use the default hostname verifier that checks hostname against the certificate."
