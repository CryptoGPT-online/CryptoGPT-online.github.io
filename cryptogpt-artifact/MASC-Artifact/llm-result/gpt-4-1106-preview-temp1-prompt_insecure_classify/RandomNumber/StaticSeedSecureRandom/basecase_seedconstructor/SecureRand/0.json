  "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "vulnerable_code": [
    "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);",
    "SecureRandom rand2 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);"
  ],
  "description": "By using a fixed seed for the SecureRandom instance, the randomness of the values is compromised, making it predictable, which is not suitable for cryptographic operations where unpredictability is crucial.",
  "recommendation": "Remove the seed, allowing SecureRandom to self-seed with values likely to be more unpredictable. If a seed is necessary, ensure it is generated using a high-entropy source."
