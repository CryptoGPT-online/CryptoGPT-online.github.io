        "description": "Setting the same seed on two instances of SecureRandom makes them produce the same sequence of numbers, which is predictable and not sufficiently random for secure applications.",
        "recommendation": "Avoid manually seeding SecureRandom unless it is really necessary, and never with a fixed, predictable seed. Let the implementation gather enough entropy on its own."
