        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is derived from the current time formatted as a string, which is predictable and not cryptographically random. This can lead to predictable IVs which can be exploited in certain cryptographic attacks.",

        "description": "The IV is being truncated to only 8 bytes (64 bits), which does not match the typical block size of modern encryption algorithms (e.g., 128 bits for AES). This can lead to weak encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the IV length matches the block size of the encryption algorithm used (e.g., 16 bytes for AES)."
