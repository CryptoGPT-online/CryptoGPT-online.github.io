        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is derived from the current timestamp which is predictable and therefore not cryptographically random. Furthermore, only the first 8 bytes of the timestamp are used, which may not provide adequate randomness even if the source were secure.",

        "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);",
        "description": "Using only the first 8 bytes of the IV can be inadequate for encryption strength, especially for ciphers like AES which typically expect a 16-byte IV.",
        "recommendation": "Use an IV that matches the block size of the cipher (e.g., 16 bytes for AES)."
