The provided code does not contain enough context or actual cryptographic operations to assess cryptographic API misuse fully. The code snippets you've shared are mostly related to date formatting and printing, and the only piece that relates to cryptography is the creation of an `IvParameterSpec` object, which could potentially be part of a cryptographic operation, but without the accompanying encryption or decryption code, it is not possible to definitively identify misuses.

The provided code is insufficient for a complete analysis, but there are potential concerns with using parts of a timestamp as an Initialization Vector (IV) which might not be random or unique enough for cryptographic purposes. However, due to the lack of actual cryptographic operations using this IV, it is not possible to classify it under any of the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories you've listed.
