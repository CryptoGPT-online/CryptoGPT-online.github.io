        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is created from a deterministic source (a string of sequential ASCII characters), which is predictable and not random. This can lead to IV reuse or predictability, reducing the security of cryptographic operations.",

        "recommendation": "Use an IV that is at least as long as the block size of the cipher being used (typically 16 bytes for AES) and ensure it is generated using a secure random source."
