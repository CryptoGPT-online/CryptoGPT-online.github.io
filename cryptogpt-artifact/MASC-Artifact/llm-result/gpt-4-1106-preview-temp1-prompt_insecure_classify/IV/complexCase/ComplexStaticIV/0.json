        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) for the cipher is generated using a non-random, predictable method, which can make cryptographic operations vulnerable to certain attacks, such as chosen-plaintext attacks.",

        "recommendation": "Use an IV that is the same size as the block size of the cipher algorithm, typically 16 bytes for AES."

        "description": "The IV is generated in a hardcoded, deterministic way, which could be considered a form of hardcoded credentials, making the encryption less secure since the IV should be unpredictable and unique for each encryption operation.",
        "recommendation": "Never hardcode the IV. Always generate it randomly and securely for each encryption operation."
