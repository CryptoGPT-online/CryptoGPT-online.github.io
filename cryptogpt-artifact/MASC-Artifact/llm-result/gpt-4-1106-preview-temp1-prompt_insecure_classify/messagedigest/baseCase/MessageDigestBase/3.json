    "description": "MD5 is a widely considered broken and risky cryptographic hash function. Collisions have been found, which makes it unsuitable for further use, especially in secure hashing scenarios such as password storage, digital signatures, or certificate verifications.",
    "recommendation": "Replace MD5 with a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or higher."
