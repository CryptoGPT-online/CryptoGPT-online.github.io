    "description": "DES is considered a broken and risky cryptographic algorithm because its key size is too small (56-bit keys) to protect against brute-force attacks with modern computing power.",
    "recommendation": "Switch to a more secure encryption algorithm like AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
