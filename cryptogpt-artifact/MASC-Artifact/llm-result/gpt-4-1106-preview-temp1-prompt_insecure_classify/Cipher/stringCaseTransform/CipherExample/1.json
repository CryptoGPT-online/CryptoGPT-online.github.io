        "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered insecure due to its short key length of 56 bits, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks. Modern applications should use stronger algorithms like AES.",
        "recommendation": "Replace DES with a more secure algorithm such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
