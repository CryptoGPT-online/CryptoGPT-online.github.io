        "description": "The code is using DES which is considered to be weak due to its small key size of 56 bits. Modern applications should use stronger algorithms like AES with a key size of 128 or more bits.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'DES' with a more secure algorithm such as 'AES/GCM/NoPadding' along with a key size of at least 128 bits."

        "description": "DES is known to be a broken algorithm due to vulnerabilities like the Sweet32 attack and should not be used in secure applications.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'DES' with a secure algorithm like 'AES'. Additionally, you might want to use authenticated encryption modes such as GCM to provide both privacy and integrity."
