        "description": "The use of 'DES' (Data Encryption Standard) is insecure as it is an outdated encryption algorithm with a key size of 56-bits, which is considered to be too small and can be broken relatively easily with modern computing power.",
        "recommendation": "Replace 'DES' with a more secure encryption algorithm such as 'AES' (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key size of at least 128 bits."
