  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"des\")",
  "description": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered to be a broken and insecure cryptographic algorithm due to its short key length of 56 bits, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key size of at least 128 bits."
