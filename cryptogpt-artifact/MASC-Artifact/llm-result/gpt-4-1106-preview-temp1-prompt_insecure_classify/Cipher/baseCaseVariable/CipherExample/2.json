        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(algorithmName)",
        "description": "Cipher.getInstance is called without specifying the mode and padding. This could result in defaults that might not be secure, such as ECB mode which is insecure for data of any significant length and PKCS5Padding which might not be suitable for all cases.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the cipher transformation fully including mode and padding (e.g., AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding) and ensure that you use a secure mode of operation such as CBC, CFB, OFB, or GCM."
