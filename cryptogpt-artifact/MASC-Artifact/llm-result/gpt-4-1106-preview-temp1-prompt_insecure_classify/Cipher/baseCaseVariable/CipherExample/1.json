    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(algorithmName)",
    "description": "The code does not specify a mode of operation or padding scheme when getting an instance of the Cipher class for AES. This means it defaults to ECB mode which is not secure for data that spans more than one block and PKCS5Padding which might not be the most secure option available.",
    "recommendation": "Specify a secure mode of operation and padding scheme when getting an instance of the Cipher class, for instance 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding'."
