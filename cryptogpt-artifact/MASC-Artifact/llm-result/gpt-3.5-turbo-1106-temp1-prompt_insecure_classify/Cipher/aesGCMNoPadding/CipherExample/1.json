[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");", 
  "description": "The use of \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\" may potentially be less secure due to the lack of padding, which can expose information about the message length. Additionally, the lack of padding may make the ciphertext susceptible to padding oracle attacks.", 
  "recommendation": "Prefer using authenticated encryption modes like AES/GCM with proper padding (e.g., \"AES/GCM/PKCS5Padding\")."}]
