[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");", "description": "The code uses the AES/GCM/NoPadding transformation which does not include authentication. GCM mode should be used with authenticated encryption, such as GCM with a required padding scheme like PKCS5Padding.", "recommendation": "Use AES/GCM/NoPadding only in combination with an authenticated encryption mode or consider using a different padding scheme like PKCS5Padding."}]
