[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\")", "description": "The code is using the AES algorithm in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with no padding. However, GCM mode should use an authentication tag for secure encryption. Not using an authentication tag may lead to security vulnerabilities.", "recommendation": "Use AES/GCM/withPKCS5Padding or AES/GCM/withNoPadding to enable authentication tag for secure encryption."}]
