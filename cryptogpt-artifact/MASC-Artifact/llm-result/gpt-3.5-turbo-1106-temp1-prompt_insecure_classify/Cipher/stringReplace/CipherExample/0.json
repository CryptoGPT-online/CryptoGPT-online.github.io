[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"DE$S\".replace(\"$\", \"\"));", 
  "description": "The code is replacing a character in the algorithm name before obtaining the Cipher instance, which may lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm during negotiation.", 
  "recommendation": "Avoid dynamically modifying the algorithm name before obtaining the Cipher instance. Use a secure and standard algorithm name like AES/GCM/NoPadding for symmetric encryption."}]
