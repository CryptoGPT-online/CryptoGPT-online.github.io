    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\".replace(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\", \"DES\"));",
    "description": "The code attempts to dynamically replace the secure AES/GCM/NoPadding algorithm with the less-secure DES algorithm, which can lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm during encryption/decryption.",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to use a secure algorithm directly without dynamically replacing it, and to carefully review and select the appropriate cryptographic algorithm based on security requirements."
