[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(algorithmName)", "description": "The code directly uses the algorithm specified in the algorithmName variable without considering the strength or security of the algorithm. This can lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm during negotiation.", "recommendation": "Instead of directly using the algorithm specified in the variable, consider using a more secure algorithm like AES/GCM/NoPadding for AES encryption."}]
