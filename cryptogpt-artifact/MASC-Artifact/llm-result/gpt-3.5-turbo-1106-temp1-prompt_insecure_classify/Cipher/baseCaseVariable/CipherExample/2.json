[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", "vulnerable_code": "String algorithmName = \"AES\"; Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(algorithmName);", "description": "The code does not specify the mode and padding for the AES algorithm, which can lead to the selection of less-secure defaults. Depending on the JRE version and provider, the default mode and padding may not provide the desired level of security.", "recommendation": "Specify the mode and padding explicitly when obtaining the cipher instance. For example, use Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\") for GCM mode with no padding."}]
