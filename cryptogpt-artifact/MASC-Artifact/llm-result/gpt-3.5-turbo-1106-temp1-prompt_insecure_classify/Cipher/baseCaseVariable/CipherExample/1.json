[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
  "vulnerable_code": "String algorithmName = \"AES\";",
  "description": "The code directly specifies the algorithm to be used without considering the strength or security level of the algorithm. This can lead to the selection of a less-secure or outdated algorithm.",
  "recommendation": "Instead of hardcoding the algorithm name, use a secure algorithm selection mechanism and consider using algorithms from a known, reputable provider like the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) standard algorithms."}]
