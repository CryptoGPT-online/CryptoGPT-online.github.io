[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(new CipherExample().methodA().methodB().getCipherName());", 
  "description": "The code dynamically changes the cipherName based on method calls, which can lead to the selection of less-secure algorithm during the cipher instance initialization.",
  "recommendation": "Use a fixed, known secure algorithm and mode such as AES/GCM/NoPadding and remove the dynamic cipherName assignment in the methods."}]
