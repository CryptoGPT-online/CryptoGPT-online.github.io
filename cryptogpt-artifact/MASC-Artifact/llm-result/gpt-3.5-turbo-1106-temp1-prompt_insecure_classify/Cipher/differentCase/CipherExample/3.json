[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"des\");", "description": "The DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm is considered broken and insecure for modern cryptographic standards due to its small key size and vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Its usage is not recommended for secure communications.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a sufficient key size."}]
