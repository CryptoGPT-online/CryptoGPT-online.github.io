[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(\"des\")", "description": "The DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm is considered insecure and should not be used for encryption in new systems. It has been widely deprecated due to its small key size and known vulnerabilities.", "recommendation": "Use a strong encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of DES. For example, use Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\") to instantiate a Cipher object with AES algorithm."}]
