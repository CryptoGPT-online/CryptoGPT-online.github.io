[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", 
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"des\");",
  "description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered to be insecure and should not be used for any purpose. It is susceptible to brute-force attacks and does not provide an adequate level of security.",
  "recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm such as AES for encryption. AES is currently considered the standard for symmetric key cryptography and provides a high level of security."}]
