    "description": "The DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm is considered broken and insecure for modern applications due to its small key size and vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Its usage should be avoided in favor of stronger algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).",
    "recommendation": "Use AES or another strong encryption algorithm instead of DES."
