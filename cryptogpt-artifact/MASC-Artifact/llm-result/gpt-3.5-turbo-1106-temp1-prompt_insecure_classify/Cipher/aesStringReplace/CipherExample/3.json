    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\".replace(\"A\", \"D\"));",
    "description": "The code is dynamically replacing characters in the algorithm name, which can lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm during the negotiation process.",
    "recommendation": "Use a fixed, standard algorithm name (e.g., \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\") for Cipher.getInstance() method to ensure a secure and consistent algorithm selection."
