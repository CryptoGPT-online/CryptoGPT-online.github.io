    "description": "The custom implementation of checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods does not perform proper validation of the client or server certificates. It only checks if the authentication type is not RSA and the length of X.509 certificates is greater than or equal to 314, which is not a standard or secure way of validating certificates.",

    "recommendation": "Specify a secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm and provider when initializing the SSLContext, such as \"SHA1PRNG\" for algorithm and \"SUN\" for provider."
