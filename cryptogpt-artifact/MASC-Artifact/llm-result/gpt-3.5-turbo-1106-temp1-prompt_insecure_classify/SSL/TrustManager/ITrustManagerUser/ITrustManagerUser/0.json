[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {}",
  "description": "The custom implementation of X509TrustManager's checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods does not perform any validation of the X.509 certificate, which makes the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and other certificate-based attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation mechanism inside the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods to validate the X.509 certificate and verify its authenticity. This can be done by using standard TrustManager implementations or by implementing a custom validation mechanism following best practices."}]
