[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "public interface ITrustManager extends X509TrustManager { }", "description": "The code is creating a custom TrustManager by implementing the X509TrustManager interface directly instead of extending the built-in X509ExtendedTrustManager. This may lead to improper certificate validation as the custom TrustManager may not perform all necessary checks for secure certificate validation.", "recommendation": "Extend the X509ExtendedTrustManager instead of implementing the X509TrustManager directly, and override the checkServerTrusted and checkClientTrusted methods to provide custom validation logic while ensuring all necessary checks are performed."}]
