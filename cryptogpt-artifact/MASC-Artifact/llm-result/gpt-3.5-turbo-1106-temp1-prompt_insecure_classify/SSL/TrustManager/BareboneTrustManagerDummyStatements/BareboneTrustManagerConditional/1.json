[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "TrustManager[] trustAll = new TrustManager[] {...}", "description": "The code uses a custom TrustManager with overridden checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods which do not perform any actual certificate validation, making the SSL/TLS communication vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.", "recommendation": "Properly validate the server's certificate by implementing the TrustManager interface to perform certificate validation based on trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and hostname verification."}]
