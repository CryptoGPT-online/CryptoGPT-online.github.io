It only checks if the authentication type is RSA and if the certificate array length is greater than or equal to 314, which is not a secure or comprehensive validation.",

Consider using a standard trust manager implementation such as TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm()) to obtain the default trust manager, which performs proper certificate validation."
