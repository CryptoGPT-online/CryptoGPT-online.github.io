[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", 
  "vulnerable_code": "public X509TrustManager getTrustmanager(){...}",
  "description": "The code uses a custom TrustManager implementation with empty or incomplete validation logic in checkServerTrusted and checkClientTrusted methods. This can lead to accepting invalid or self-signed certificates, exposing the application to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic in the checkServerTrusted and checkClientTrusted methods to ensure the server's and client's certificates are verified effectively. Consider using a standard TrustManager implementation from a trusted library."}]
