  "description": "The custom X509TrustManager implementation does not perform any certificate validation in the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods, which can lead to insecure connections being trusted without proper validation of the server's certificate.", 
  "recommendation": "Ensure that the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods perform appropriate validation, such as checking the server's certificate chain, expiration, revocation status, and hostname."}]
