[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "public class Bt implements X509TrustManager {...}", "description": "The implemented checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are empty, so they are not performing any actual certificate validation. This can lead to improper certificate validation and make the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.", "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic inside the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods to verify the received certificates against the trusted CA certificates or custom trust anchors."}]
