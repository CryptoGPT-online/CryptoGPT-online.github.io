[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "new BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass();", "description": "The code instantiates a custom X509TrustManager called BareBone_X509TrustManagerCanNotBypass without validating the server's certificate. This can lead to insecure SSL/TLS connections as it bypasses certificate validation checks.", "recommendation": "Replace the custom X509TrustManager with a properly implemented trust manager that performs certificate validation checks, or use the default system trust manager."}]
