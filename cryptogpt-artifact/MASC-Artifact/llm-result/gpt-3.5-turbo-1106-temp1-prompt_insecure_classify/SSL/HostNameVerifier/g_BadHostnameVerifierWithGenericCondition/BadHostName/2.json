[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "public class Be { public static void main(String[] args) { new HostNameVerifier(){ @Override public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { if(true || session == null){ return true; } return false; } }; } }", "description": "The code is implementing a custom HostNameVerifier for SSL/TLS connections, but the implementation does not perform any actual hostname verification, as it always returns true regardless of the input. This can lead to improper certificate validation and may expose the application to man-in-the-middle attacks.", "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification logic within the verify method to ensure that the SSL/TLS connection is securely established without being vulnerable to impersonation or interception."}]
