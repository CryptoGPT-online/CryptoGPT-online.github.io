[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.", 
  "vulnerable_code": "public class Be {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new HostNameVerifier(){\n            @Override\n            public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}",
  "description": "The code creates a custom HostnameVerifier that blindly returns true, which effectively disables the SSL/TLS certificate validation. This can expose the application to man-in-the-middle attacks and other security threats.", 
  "recommendation": "Proper certificate validation should be implemented in the verify method to ensure the SSL/TLS connection is secure. Consider using standard HostnameVerifier implementations provided by the Java platform, or implement custom validation logic following best practices for SSL/TLS certificate validation."}]
