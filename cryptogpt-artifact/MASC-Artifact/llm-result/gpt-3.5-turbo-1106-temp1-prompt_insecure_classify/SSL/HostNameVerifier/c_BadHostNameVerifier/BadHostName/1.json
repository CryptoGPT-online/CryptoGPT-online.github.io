    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { return true; }",
    "description": "The custom HostnameVerifier implementation blindly returns true, which essentially disables hostname verification in SSL/TLS connections. This can make the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper hostname verification logic in the verify method to ensure the hostname of the server's certificate matches the hostname of the server being connected to."
