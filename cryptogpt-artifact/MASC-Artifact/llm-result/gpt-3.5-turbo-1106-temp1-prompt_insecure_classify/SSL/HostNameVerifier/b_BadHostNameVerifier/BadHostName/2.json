[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "public class Be {...}", "description": "The code overrides the hostnameVerifier to unconditionally return true, which means it will accept any SSL certificate presented by the server without validation. This can lead to potential man-in-the-middle attacks or server impersonation.", "recommendation": "Ensure proper certificate validation by implementing a custom HostnameVerifier to perform validation based on the server's certificate."}]
