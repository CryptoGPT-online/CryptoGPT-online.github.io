[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {...}", "description": "The custom implementation of HostnameVerifier's verify method does not perform any certificate validation, it simply returns true unconditionally. This means that the SSL/TLS connection will not validate the hostname of the server against the certificate it presents, potentially exposing the client to man-in-the-middle attacks.", "recommendation": "Ensure that the custom HostnameVerifier implementation performs proper certificate validation by checking the hostname against the certificate presented by the server in the SSLSession parameter."}]
