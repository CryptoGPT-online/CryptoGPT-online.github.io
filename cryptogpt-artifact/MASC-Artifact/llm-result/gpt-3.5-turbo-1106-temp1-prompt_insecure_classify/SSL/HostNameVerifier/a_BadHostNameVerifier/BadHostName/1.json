[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {return true;}", "description": "The implementation of the verify method simply returns true, which means it is not validating the SSL certificate of the host. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and other security risks related to improper certificate validation.", "recommendation": "Implement proper certificate validation logic inside the verify method using standard SSL/TLS certificate validation mechanisms."}]
