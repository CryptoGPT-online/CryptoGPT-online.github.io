    "vulnerable_code": "session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0",
    "description": "The code uses a non-standard method to check the strength of the cipher suite, which could lead to the selection of a less secure algorithm during the SSL/TLS negotiation process.",
    "recommendation": "Use standard and recommended methods to check the strength of the cipher suite during SSL/TLS negotiation. Avoid using non-standard or custom logic for cipher suite strength evaluation."
