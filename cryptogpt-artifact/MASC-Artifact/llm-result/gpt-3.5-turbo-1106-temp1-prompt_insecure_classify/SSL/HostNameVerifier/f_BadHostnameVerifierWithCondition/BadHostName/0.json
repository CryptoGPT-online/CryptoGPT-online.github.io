    "description": "The code contains a condition 'if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0)' which always evaluates to true, allowing any cipher suite to be accepted during SSL/TLS negotiation, potentially resulting in the selection of less-secure cryptographic algorithms.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the SSL/TLS server enforces the use of secure cryptographic algorithms by properly validating the cipher suite and rejecting any weaker or deprecated algorithms."
