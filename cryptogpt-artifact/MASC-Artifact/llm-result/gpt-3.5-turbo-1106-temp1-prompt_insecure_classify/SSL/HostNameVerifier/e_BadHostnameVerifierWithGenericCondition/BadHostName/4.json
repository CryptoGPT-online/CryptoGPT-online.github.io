[{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation", "vulnerable_code": "public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { if(true || session == null){ return true; } return false; }", "description": "The code contains an improper certificate validation where it returns true without checking the server's certificate. The 'if(true || session == null)' condition allows any host to be trusted, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks.", "recommendation": "Properly implement the hostname verification logic by checking the server's certificate and hostname for secure SSL/TLS connections."}]
