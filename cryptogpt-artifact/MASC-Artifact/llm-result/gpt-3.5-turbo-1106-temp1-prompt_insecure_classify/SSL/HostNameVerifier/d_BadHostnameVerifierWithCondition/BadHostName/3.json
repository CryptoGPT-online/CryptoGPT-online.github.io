[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation", "vulnerable_code": "if(true || session.getCipherSuite().length()>=0){", "description": "The code always evaluates the `if` condition to true, making it possible for less secure cipher suites to be accepted during SSL/TLS negotiation.", "recommendation": "Ensure that the condition in the `if` statement properly evaluates the cipher suite strength and does not unconditionally accept it. Consider using a secure default configuration or allowing configuration through a trusted and secure mechanism."}]
