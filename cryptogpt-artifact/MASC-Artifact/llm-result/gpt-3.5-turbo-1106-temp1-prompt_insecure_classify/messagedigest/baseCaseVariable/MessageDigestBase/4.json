[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(algorithmName);", "description": "The code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm which is considered broken and risky for cryptographic operations due to its vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use a more secure algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 for hashing operations.", "recommendation": "Replace the MD5 algorithm with a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."}]
