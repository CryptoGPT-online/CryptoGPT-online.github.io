[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
 "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName());",
 "description": "The code uses method chaining to select the algorithm for the MessageDigest instance, potentially resulting in the selection of a less secure algorithm. The chaining of methods A() and B() sets the algorithm name to 'MD5', which is known to be less secure compared to 'SHA-256'.",
 "recommendation": "Use a direct assignment to specify the algorithm name, and avoid method chaining for algorithm selection. Ensure that only secure algorithms are used for cryptographic operations."}]
