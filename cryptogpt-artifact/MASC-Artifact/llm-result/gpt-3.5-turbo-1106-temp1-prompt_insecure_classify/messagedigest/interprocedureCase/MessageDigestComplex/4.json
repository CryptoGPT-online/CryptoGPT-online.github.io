[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "digestName = \"MD5\";","description": "The code snippet uses the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure for certain cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities in its design. It should not be used for secure hashing or other cryptographic operations.","recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."}]
