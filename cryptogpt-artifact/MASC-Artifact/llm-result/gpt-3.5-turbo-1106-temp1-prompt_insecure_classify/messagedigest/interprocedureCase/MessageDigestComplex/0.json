        "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(new MessageDigestComplex().A().B().getName());",
        "description": "The code is using method chaining to obtain a MessageDigest instance without explicitly specifying the algorithm. This can lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm during the negotiation process, as it calls both A() and B() methods on the MessageDigestComplex instance, potentially changing the algorithm to MD5, which is less secure.",
        "recommendation": "Specify the desired algorithm explicitly when obtaining the MessageDigest instance to ensure that a secure algorithm is used."
