[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"md5\".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH));", "description": "The code is using the MD5 algorithm which is considered broken and insecure for most cryptographic purposes due to its vulnerabilities. It should not be used for any security-sensitive operations.", "recommendation": "Use a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead of MD5 for cryptographic operations."}]
