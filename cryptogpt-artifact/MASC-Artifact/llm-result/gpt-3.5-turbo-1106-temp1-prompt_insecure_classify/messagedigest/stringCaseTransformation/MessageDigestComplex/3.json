[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"md5\".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH));", "description": "The code is using the MD5 algorithm which is considered broken and insecure for most purposes due to its vulnerabilities. Additionally, the attempt to obfuscate the algorithm selection by converting it to upper case does not address the underlying issue.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."}]
