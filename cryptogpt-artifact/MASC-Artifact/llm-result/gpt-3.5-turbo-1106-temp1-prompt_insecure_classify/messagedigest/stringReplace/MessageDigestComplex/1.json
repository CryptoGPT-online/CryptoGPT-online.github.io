[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD$5\".replace(\"$\", \"\"));", "description": "The code is attempting to use the MD5 hashing algorithm, but it is using a non-standard algorithm name 'MD$5' and replacing the '$' character with an empty string, resulting in 'MD5' algorithm being used. This is risky as it may lead to unexpected algorithm usage.", "recommendation": "Use the standard algorithm name 'MD5' directly without any string manipulation."}]
