[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.", "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD$5\".replace(\"$\", \"\"));", "description": "The code is attempting to replace the dollar sign ($) in the algorithm name with an empty string, resulting in the algorithm \"MD5\" being used. This is a potential security risk as MD5 is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.", "recommendation": "Use a secure cryptographic algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead."}]
