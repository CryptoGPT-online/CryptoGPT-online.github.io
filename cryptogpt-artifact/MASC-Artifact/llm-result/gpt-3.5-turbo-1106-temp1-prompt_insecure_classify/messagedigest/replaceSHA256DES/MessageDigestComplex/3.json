[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"MD5\"));", "description": "The code is attempting to use the SHA-256 algorithm, but then replaces it with the less-secure MD5 algorithm. This could result in the selection of a less secure cryptographic algorithm.", "recommendation": "Ensure that the correct algorithm is used without any unnecessary replacements or modifications. In this case, the code should be modified to simply use MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\"); without any string replacements."}]
