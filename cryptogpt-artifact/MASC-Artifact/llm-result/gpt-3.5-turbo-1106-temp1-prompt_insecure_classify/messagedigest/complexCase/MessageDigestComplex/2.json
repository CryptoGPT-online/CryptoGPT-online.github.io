[{"misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.", "vulnerable_code": "cryptoDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\".replace(\"SHA-256\", \"md5\"));", "description": "The code is attempting to replace the SHA-256 algorithm with MD5, which is less secure. This could lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm during negotiation.", "recommendation": "Use the correct algorithm name directly without any replacement. If dynamic algorithm selection based on certain conditions is required, ensure that only secure algorithms are allowed."}]
