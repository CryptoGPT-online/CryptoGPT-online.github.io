[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "rand1.setSeed(seedBytes); rand2.setSeed(seedBytes);", "description": "Setting seed with a constant value 'Seed' can lead to insufficiently random values for the SecureRandom instances.", "recommendation": "Use a more secure and random seed, such as using SecureRandom.generateSeed or reading from a secure source of randomness like /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems."}]
