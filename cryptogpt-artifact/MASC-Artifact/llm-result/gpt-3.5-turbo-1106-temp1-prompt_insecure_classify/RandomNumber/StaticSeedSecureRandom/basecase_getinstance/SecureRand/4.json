[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", 
  "vulnerable_code": "rand1.setSeed(seedBytes);\nrand2.setSeed(seedBytes);", 
  "description": "The setSeed method is used to provide initial seed for the random number generator. In this code, the same seed is used for both rand1 and rand2, which can lead to predictability and reduced randomness of the generated numbers.", 
  "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator without setting a fixed seed or use a more secure source of randomness, such as SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()."}]
