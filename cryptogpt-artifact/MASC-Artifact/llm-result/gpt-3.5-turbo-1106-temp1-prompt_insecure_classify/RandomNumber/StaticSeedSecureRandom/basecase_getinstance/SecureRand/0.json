        "description": "The code sets the seed of two different SecureRandom instances with a static value, which does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic purposes.",
        "recommendation": "Use a more secure and random source of seed data, such as SecureRandom.generateSeed() or /dev/urandom on Unix-based systems, and remove the explicit seeding with setSeed()."
