[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);", "description": "Using a fixed seed for a SecureRandom instance results in insufficiently random values, as the same seed will produce the same sequence of random numbers each time the program runs.", "recommendation": "Use SecureRandom without a seed to obtain cryptographically strong random values, or consider using SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() for better randomness."}]
