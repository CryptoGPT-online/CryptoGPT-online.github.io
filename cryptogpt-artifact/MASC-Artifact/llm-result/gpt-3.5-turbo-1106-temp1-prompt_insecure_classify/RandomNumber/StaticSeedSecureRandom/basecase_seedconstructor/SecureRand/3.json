[{"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);\nSecureRandom rand2 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);", "description": "The same seed is used to initialize two SecureRandom instances, which can lead to predictable and non-uniform random number generation.", "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically strong random seed to initialize the SecureRandom instances, and ensure that different seeds are used for different instances to improve randomness and unpredictability of the generated numbers."}]
