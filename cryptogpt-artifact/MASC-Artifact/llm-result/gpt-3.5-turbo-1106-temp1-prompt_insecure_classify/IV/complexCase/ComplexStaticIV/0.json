[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);",
  "description": "The initialization vector (IV) length is set to 8 bytes, which is the minimum length required for most block cipher modes of operation. It is recommended to use the full IV length required by the specific cipher mode to ensure strong encryption.",
  "recommendation": "Use a full IV length required by the specific cipher mode, or generate a secure random IV of appropriate length."}]
