[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);", "description": "The initialization vector (IV) length is set to 8, which is too short for many encryption algorithms. A standard IV length for AES encryption should be 16 bytes (128 bits).", "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate a proper IV with the required length, such as SecureRandom class in Java."}]
