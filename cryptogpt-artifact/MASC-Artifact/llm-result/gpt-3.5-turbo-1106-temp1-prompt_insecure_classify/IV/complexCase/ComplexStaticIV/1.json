[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.", "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);","description": "The initialization vector (IV) length should match the block size of the cipher being used. In this case, the IV length is set to 8 bytes, which may not be suitable for all ciphers. Additionally, using a non-random or predictable IV can weaken the encryption.", "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate the IV, and ensure that the IV length matches the block size of the cipher being used."}]
