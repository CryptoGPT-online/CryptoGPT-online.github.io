[{"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength", 
  "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);", 
  "description": "The initialization vector (IV) size should be equal to the block size of the cipher. Using a hardcoded IV of length 8 may weaken the encryption strength.",
