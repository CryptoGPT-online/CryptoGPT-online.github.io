    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(val.getBytes(),0,8);",
    "description": "The initialization vector (IV) length should be the same as the block size of the cipher. Using a fixed IV length of 8 bytes may weaken the encryption strength and make it more vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator to generate an IV with the appropriate length for the chosen block cipher."
