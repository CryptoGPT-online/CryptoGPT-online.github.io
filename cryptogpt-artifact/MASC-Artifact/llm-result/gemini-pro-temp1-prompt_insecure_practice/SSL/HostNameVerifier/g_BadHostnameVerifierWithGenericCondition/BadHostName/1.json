This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can intercept and modify the traffic between the client and the server. A malicious server with a certificate for any hostname can impersonate the intended server and establish a secure connection with the client.", "recommendation": "Hostname verification should be performed correctly to ensure that the client is connecting to the intended server. The `verify` method should check if the hostname in the certificate matches the hostname of the server being connected to."}]
