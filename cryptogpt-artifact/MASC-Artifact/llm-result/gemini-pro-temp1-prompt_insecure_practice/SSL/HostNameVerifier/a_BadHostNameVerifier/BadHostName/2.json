    "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate Trust",
    "vulnerable_code": "new HostnameVerifier(){....}",
    "description": "This code creates a custom hostname verifier that always returns `true`, which means that it will accept any SSL certificate, regardless of whether it is trusted or not. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept the connection and impersonate the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that checks the certificate chain and hostname against a list of trusted certificates."
