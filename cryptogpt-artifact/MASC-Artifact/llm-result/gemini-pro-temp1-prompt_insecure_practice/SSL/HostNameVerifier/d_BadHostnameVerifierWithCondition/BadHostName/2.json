    "description": "This code is vulnerable to the Broken Crypto Algorithm weakness because it uses a weak cipher suite. The length of the cipher suite is not a reliable indicator of its strength. Attackers could exploit this weakness by sending a specially crafted request that uses a weak cipher suite, which could allow them to decrypt the traffic or impersonate the server.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong cipher suite that is appropriate for the application's security requirements."
