    "misuse": "CWE-295",
    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){...}",
    "description": "This code overrides the default hostname verification, which can lead to accepting a connection to a server with an invalid certificate. This could allow an attacker to impersonate the server and intercept or modify the communication.",
    "recommendation": "Use the default hostname verification mechanism, or implement a custom hostname verifier that checks the certificate's hostname against a trusted list or uses a more secure algorithm."
