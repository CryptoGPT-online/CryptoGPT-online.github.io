    "misuse": "CWE-297",
    "vulnerable_code": "session == null",
    "description": "This code checks if the SSLSession is null. If it is, it returns true, which means that the hostname will be verified regardless of its validity. This is a security risk because it could allow an attacker to spoof the hostname and trick the user into connecting to a malicious website.",
    "recommendation": "The code should be changed to check if the SSLSession is not null and if the hostname is valid."
