    "vulnerable_code": "new HostNameVerifier(){ ... }",
    "description": "The code overrides the default hostname verifier and always returns `true`, which means that any hostname will be accepted. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use the default hostname verifier or implement a custom verifier that validates the hostname against a trusted certificate authority."
