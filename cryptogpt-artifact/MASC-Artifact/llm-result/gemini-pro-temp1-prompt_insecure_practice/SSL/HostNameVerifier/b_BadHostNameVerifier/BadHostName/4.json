    "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "new HostnameVerifier(){...}",
    "description": "The code overrides the `HostnameVerifier` and always returns `true`, which means that any hostname will be accepted for the TLS connection. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate server and intercept the communication.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper hostname verifier that validates the hostname against a trusted certificate authority (CA)."
