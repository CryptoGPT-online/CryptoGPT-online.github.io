    "vulnerable_code": "new HostnameVerifier(){...}",
    "description": "The HostnameVerifier interface is intended to be implemented by a class that knows how to determine whether a hostname is trusted for a given SSL session. By implementing this interface as an anonymous inner class, the programmer is creating a new instance of the class each time the verify() method is called. This could lead to unexpected results, such as the hostname being verified differently each time the method is called.",
    "recommendation": "Implement the HostnameVerifier interface in a separate class and create a single instance of that class. This will ensure that the hostname is verified consistently."
