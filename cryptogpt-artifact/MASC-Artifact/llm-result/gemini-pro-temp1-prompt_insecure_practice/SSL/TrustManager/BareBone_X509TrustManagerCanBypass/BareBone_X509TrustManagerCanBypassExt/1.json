There is one crypto API misuse in the code:

{
  "misuse": "Missing certificate path validation",
  "vulnerable_code": "you didn't perform any certificate chain validation in the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted",
  "description": "In Java, a custom X.509 trust manager can be created by implementing the javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager interface. This interface provides three methods: checkClientTrusted, checkServerTrusted, and getAcceptedIssuers. The checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods are used to validate the certificate chain of a remote peer. However, in your code, you have not implemented these methods. This means that any certificate will be considered valid, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "recommendation": "Implement the checkClientTrusted and checkServerTrusted methods to perform certificate chain validation."
