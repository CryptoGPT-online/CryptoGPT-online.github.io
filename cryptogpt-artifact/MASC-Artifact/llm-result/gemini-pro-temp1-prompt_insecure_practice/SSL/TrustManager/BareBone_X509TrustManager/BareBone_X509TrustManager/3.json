    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Entropy",
    "vulnerable_code": "`getTrustmanager` method",
    "description": "The `getTrustmanager` method creates a new `X509TrustManager` instance without specifying a source of entropy. This leaves the implementation vulnerable to weak random number generation, which could allow an attacker to predict the generated keys and compromise the security of the application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (such as `SecureRandom`) to generate the entropy for the `X509TrustManager` instance."
