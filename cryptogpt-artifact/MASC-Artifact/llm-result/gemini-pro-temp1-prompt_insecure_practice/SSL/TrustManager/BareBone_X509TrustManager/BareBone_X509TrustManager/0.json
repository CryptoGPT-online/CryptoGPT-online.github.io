    "description": "The code creates a custom X509TrustManager without implementing all the required methods, such as `checkServerTrusted` and `checkClientTrusted`. This can lead to insecure behavior, such as trusting all certificates or failing to validate certificates properly.",
    "recommendation": "Implement all the required methods of the `X509TrustManager` interface, and ensure that the implementation properly validates certificates according to the intended security policy."
