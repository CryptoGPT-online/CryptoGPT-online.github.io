    "description": "This code defines a custom `X509TrustManager` that always trusts any certificate, regardless of its validity or issuer. This can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, as it allows attackers to impersonate trusted entities and intercept or modify sensitive data. Using a custom `TrustManager` without proper validation can compromise the security of your application.",
    "recommendation": "Use a default or well-established `TrustManager`. If you must use a custom `TrustManager`, ensure that it performs proper validation of certificates before trusting them."
