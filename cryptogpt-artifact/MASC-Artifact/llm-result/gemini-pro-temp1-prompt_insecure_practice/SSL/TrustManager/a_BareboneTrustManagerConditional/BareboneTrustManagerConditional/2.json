    "description": "The code is not validating the certificate chain properly. It is only checking if the certificate is of type RSA and if the chain length is greater than or equal to 314. This does not ensure that the certificate is valid or that it is issued by a trusted CA.",
    "recommendation": "Use a proper certificate validation library to validate the certificate chain. For example, you can use the `javax.net.ssl.TrustManager` interface to implement your own trust manager that performs proper certificate validation."
