    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "vulnerable_code": "Ir.main()",
    "description": "The code creates a new instance of an anonymous inner class that implements the `ITrustManager` interface. This class overrides the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods to do nothing, effectively disabling certificate validation. This is insecure because it could allow an attacker to impersonate a trusted server or client.",
    "recommendation": "Do not create instances of `ITrustManager` that disable certificate validation. Instead, use the `TrustManagerFactory` class to create a `TrustManager` that uses a specific trust store."
