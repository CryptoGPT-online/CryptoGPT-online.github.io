    "vulnerable_code": "new ITrustManager() {...}",
    "description": "The code defines and creates an instance of an anonymous inner class implementing the `ITrustManager` interface. Without any additional logic in the anonymous class, it will accept any certificate without any validation, which may lead to security issues like man-in-the-middle attacks or impersonation.",
    "recommendation": "Implement proper trust management logic in the anonymous inner class, including certificate validation and revocation checking."
