    "description": "The code creates a new instance of an anonymous inner class that implements the `ITrustManager` interface. This is not a secure way to implement trust management, as it allows any certificate to be trusted. An attacker could create a self-signed certificate and use it to impersonate a trusted server.",
    "recommendation": "Implement trust management in a more secure way, such as using a `TrustManagerFactory` to create a `TrustManager` that trusts a specific set of certificates."
