    "description": "The application instantiates an SSLContext instance with the protocol string \"SSL\" which enables the SSLv3 protocol, which is obsolete and considered insecure. Attackers can exploit this to perform downgrade attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Replace the protocol string \"SSL\" with a more secure protocol such as \"TLSv1.2\" or \"TLSv1.3\" when instantiating the SSLContext."
