    "description": "The code uses a custom `X509TrustManager` to trust all certificates, which is insecure. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and decrypt the transmitted data.",

    "description": "The code uses the default TLS protocol, which may use a weak session key length. This can lead to the session key being compromised, allowing an attacker to decrypt the transmitted data.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong TLS protocol, such as TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3, and specify a strong session key length, such as 256 bits."
