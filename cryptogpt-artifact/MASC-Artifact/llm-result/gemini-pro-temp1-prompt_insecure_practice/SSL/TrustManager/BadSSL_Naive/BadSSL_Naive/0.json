    "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Password Storage",
    "vulnerable_code": "public static final String userURL = \"https://self-signed.badssl.com\";",
    "description": "The URL used is for a self-signed certificate which should not be used in production as it can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
