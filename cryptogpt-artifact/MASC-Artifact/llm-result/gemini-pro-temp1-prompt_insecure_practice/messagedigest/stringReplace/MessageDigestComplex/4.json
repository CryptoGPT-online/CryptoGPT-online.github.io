    "description": "The code uses the `MD5` algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.  `MD5` is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as `SHA-256` or `SHA-512`."
