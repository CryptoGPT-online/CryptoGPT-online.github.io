    "description": "The code uses the MD5 algorithm, which is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same MD5 hash. This makes MD5 unsuitable for applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
