    "description": "MD5 is a broken and outdated hashing algorithm that is no longer considered secure. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. This can be used to create fraudulent messages or data that appears to be authentic.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3."
