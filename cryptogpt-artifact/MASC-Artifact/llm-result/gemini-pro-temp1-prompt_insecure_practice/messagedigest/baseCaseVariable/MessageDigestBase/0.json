    "description": "MD5 is considered a weak hashing algorithm and should not be used for security purposes. It is susceptible to collision attacks, meaning that two different inputs can produce the same hash output. This weakness makes it unsuitable for applications where data integrity is critical.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead."
