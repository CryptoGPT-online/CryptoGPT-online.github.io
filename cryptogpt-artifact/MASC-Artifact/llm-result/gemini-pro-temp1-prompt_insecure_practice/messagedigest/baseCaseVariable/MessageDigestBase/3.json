    "description": "MD5 is a weak hashing algorithm that is no longer considered secure. It is susceptible to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. This can be used to compromise digital signatures and other security mechanisms that rely on MD5.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
