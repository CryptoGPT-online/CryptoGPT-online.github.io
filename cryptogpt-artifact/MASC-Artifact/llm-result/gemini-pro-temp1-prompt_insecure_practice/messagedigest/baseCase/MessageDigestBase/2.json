    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered insecure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This makes it unsuitable for applications where data integrity is critical, such as password storage or digital signatures.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
