    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_code": "MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");",
    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is no longer considered secure and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that an attacker can find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This can be used to create fraudulent messages or to impersonate legitimate users.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
