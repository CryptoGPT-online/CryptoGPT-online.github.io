    "description": "The MD5 algorithm is considered broken and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that it is possible to find two different messages that hash to the same MD5 value. This can be used to create fraudulent messages or to impersonate other users.",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512."
