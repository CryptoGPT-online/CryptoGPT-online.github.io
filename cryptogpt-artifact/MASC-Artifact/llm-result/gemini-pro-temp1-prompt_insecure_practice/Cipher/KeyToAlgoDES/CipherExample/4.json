    "description": "The code uses the DES algorithm, which is considered weak and no longer recommended for secure applications. DES has a key size of 56 bits, which is too small to provide adequate security.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
