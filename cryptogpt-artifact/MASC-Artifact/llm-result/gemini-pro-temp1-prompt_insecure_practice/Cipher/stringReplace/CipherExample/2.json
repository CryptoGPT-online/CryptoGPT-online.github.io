{
  "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"DE$S\".replace(\"$\", \"\"));",
  "description": "The code uses DES algorithm which is considered weak and insecure. DES has a key size of only 56 bits, which is too small to provide adequate security. Attackers can easily brute-force DES keys, making it unsuitable for protecting sensitive information.",
  "recommendation": "Use a more secure cryptographic algorithm, such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits."
