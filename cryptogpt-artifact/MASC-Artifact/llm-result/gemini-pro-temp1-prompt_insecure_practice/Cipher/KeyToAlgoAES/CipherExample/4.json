    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "c.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);",
    "description": "The code uses `AES` encryption algorithm without specifying the key size. `AES` supports different key sizes such as 128, 192, and 256 bits. Not specifying the key size can lead to using a weak key size, which can reduce the security of the encryption.",
    "recommendation": "Specify the key size explicitly when generating the key. For example, `KeyGenerator keygen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\"); keygen.init(256);`"
