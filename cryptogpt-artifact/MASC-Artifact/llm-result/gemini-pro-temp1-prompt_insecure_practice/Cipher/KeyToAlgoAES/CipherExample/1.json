Sure, here is the JSON output for the crypto API misuses in the provided Java code:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
    "vulnerable_code": "String algo = \"AES\";",
    "description": "The code uses a hard-coded cryptographic key, which is insecure because it can be easily obtained by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a random key using a secure random number generator."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inappropriate Encryption",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(keygen.getAlgorithm());",
    "description": "The code uses the default Cipher algorithm, which may not be appropriate for the intended purpose. For example, the default algorithm may not be sufficiently strong to protect the data from being decrypted by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a strong encryption algorithm that is appropriate for the intended purpose."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Key that is Too Short",
    "vulnerable_code": "KeyGenerator keygen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(algo);",
    "description": "The code uses a key that is too short. For example, the default key size for AES is 128 bits, which may not be sufficient to protect the data from being decrypted by an attacker.",
    "recommendation": "Use a key that is of sufficient length to protect the data from being decrypted by an attacker."
  }
