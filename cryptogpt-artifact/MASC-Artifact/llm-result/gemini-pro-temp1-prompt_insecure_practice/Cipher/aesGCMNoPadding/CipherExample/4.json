    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/GCM/NoPadding\");",
    "description": "The code uses \"AES\" with an unspecified key length, which could be insufficient to protect the data. AES should be used with a key length of at least 128 bits (AES-128), but preferably 256 bits (AES-256).",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES-256."
