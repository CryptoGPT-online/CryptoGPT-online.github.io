    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);        \nSecureRandom rand2 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The SecureRandom class uses a SHA1PRNG as the default PRNG, which is a deterministic algorithm that can be vulnerable to statistical attacks. To ensure strong randomness, a more secure PRNG should be used, such as SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA256PRNG\").",
    "recommendation": "Use a more secure PRNG, such as SecureRandom.getInstance(\"SHA256PRNG\"), to ensure strong randomness."
