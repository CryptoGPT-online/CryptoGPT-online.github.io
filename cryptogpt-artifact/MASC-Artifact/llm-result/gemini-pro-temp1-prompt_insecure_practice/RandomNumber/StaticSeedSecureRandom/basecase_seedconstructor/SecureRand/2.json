    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Seeding of Random Number Generator",
    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);        \nSecureRandom rand2 = new SecureRandom(seedBytes);",
    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class is initialized with the same seed value for both `rand1` and `rand2`, which makes them predictable and insecure for cryptographic purposes. Using the same seed value for multiple instances of `SecureRandom` can compromise the security of the application because an attacker could potentially guess the seed value and predict the generated random numbers.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, generate a cryptographically strong random seed using a secure random number generator (RNG) such as `java.security.SecureRandom` and use it to initialize the `SecureRandom` instances."
