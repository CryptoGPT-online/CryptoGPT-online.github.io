    "description": "The `SecureRandom` class should be initialized with a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that has sufficient entropy. Using a fixed seed value, such as a string, can make the generated random numbers predictable and insecure.",
    "recommendation": "Use a secure random number generator (CSPRNG) that has sufficient entropy, such as `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`. Consider using a hardware-based CSPRNG if possible."
