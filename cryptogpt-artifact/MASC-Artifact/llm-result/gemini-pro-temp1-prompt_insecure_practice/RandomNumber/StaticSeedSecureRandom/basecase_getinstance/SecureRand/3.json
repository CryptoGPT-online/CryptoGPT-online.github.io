    "description": "Setting the seed of two different `SecureRandom` instances to the same value makes them generate the same sequence of random numbers, which can be a security risk.",
    "recommendation": "Use a different seed for each `SecureRandom` instance, such as by using `SecureRandom.generateSeed(seedBytes.length)`."
