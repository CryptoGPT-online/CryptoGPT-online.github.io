    "vulnerable_code": "SecureRandom rand1 = SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\");\nSecureRandom rand2 = SecureRandom.getInstance(\"NativePRNG\");",
    "description": "The Java class `SecureRandom` provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (CSPRNG). However, the `NativePRNG` algorithm is not a CSPRNG and should not be used for security purposes. It is only suitable for non-critical applications where high-quality randomness is not required.",
    "recommendation": "Use a CSPRNG algorithm such as `SHA1PRNG`, `SHA256PRNG`, or `DRBG` instead of `NativePRNG`."
