### False Positive Misuse ###
- **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials**
The misuse report claims the default encryption method (cipher) is hardcoded to PBEWithMD5AndDES in the constructor `SunJceCrypt#SunJceCrypt()`. However, the constructor allows users to specify their encryption method when creating a new `SunJceCrypt` object. Therefore, it's not a hardcoded credential issue.
