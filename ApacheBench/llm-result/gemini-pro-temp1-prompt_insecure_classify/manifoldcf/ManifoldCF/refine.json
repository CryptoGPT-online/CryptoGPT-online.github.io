### False Positive Misuse Reports ###
1. CWE-295: DES/RC5/DE
Justification: This misuse is reported for the code snippet that adds a polling hook to the list of polling hooks. However, this code does not perform any certificate validation and is not related to network communication, so it is a false positive.
