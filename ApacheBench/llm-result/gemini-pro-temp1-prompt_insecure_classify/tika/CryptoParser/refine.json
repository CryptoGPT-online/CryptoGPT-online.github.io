### False Positive Misuse ###
* **CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation**
* **CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.**
 - The vulnerability scanner mistakenly identifies the `super.parse` method call as hardcoding credentials or using hardcoded values because the CipherInputStream is not closed explicitly. However, closing the CipherInputStream is the responsibility of the delegating parser (superclass) in this case. The CryptoParser class is not responsible for closing the CipherInputStream.
