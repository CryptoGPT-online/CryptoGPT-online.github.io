Unfortunately, it seems the code does not use user-supplied strings to create `Cipher` instances or to get decryption keys from the parse context. Therefore, these misuse reports are false positives.

False Positive Misuse: 

Misuse Report 1 is not applicable, because the code does not take any transformation string that is user-supplied or tainted. 

Misuse Report 2 is also not applicable as the parse context is not used to retrieve keys or other sensitive information. The code uses a key, but it comes from a fixed source in the constructor.

Misuse Report 3 and 4 are also not applicable, because the code uses a transformation string that is hard-coded, and no user-provided strings are used to create a Cipher instance. 

Misuse Report 5 is also not applicable as the code retrieves a key from the parse context, but it's not user-supplied and the parse context itself is hard-coded in the code.

So, the only false positive misuses are misuse reports 3, 4, and 5. The false positive misuses need to be removed from the list.

Optimized Misuse JSON: 

The only misuse left in the list, i.e., Misuse Report 1, 2, and 5 are removed.
