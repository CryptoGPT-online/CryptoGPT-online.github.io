    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance()",
    "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(transformation)",
    "description": "The use of a cryptographic transformation which is not secure and known to be vulnerable may lead to serious vulnerabilities. The Java JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) provides transformations that are known to be vulnerable. The transformation in this case is passed as a parameter in the constructor of the `CryptoParser` class. If the transformation passed as an argument is not a well-known and secure one, it can be vulnerable to attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Check the transformation passed as argument in the `CryptoParser` class constructor. Use only transformations which are known to be secure and recommended by the security community."
