    "vulnerable_method": "java.lang.Object",

    "description": "The Cipher class in Java uses a default cryptographic algorithm called 'DESede'. This algorithm is susceptible to attacks such as timing attacks. Choosing a different cryptographic algorithm or at least ensuring that one is not used is highly recommended to mitigate against this risk.",
    "recommendation": "Use a different cryptographic algorithm or switch to a library that supports a more secure algorithm. In the case of encryption and decryption operations, consider using a higher quality algorithm like 'AES' instead of 'DESede'."
