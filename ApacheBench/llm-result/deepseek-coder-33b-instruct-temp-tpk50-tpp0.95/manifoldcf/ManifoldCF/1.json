The code is an implementation for the application server based on Apache Tomcat and PostgreSQL database. The code seems to involve configuration management (properties loading, property manipulation and etc.), file and directory management, database connectivity, logging, encryption/decryption, system polling and shutdown sequence definition.

The mentioned code snippet appears to have no specific mentions of cryptographic algorithms. 

However, the encryption methods seem to use the java.security.MessageDigest, javax.crypto.Cipher, and javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory libraries which are used for cryptographic operations in Java.

Please note that the code could potentially have issues depending on how it is used and the context where it is executed.

Here are a couple of considerations for potential misuses with regards to cryptography in the code:

1. The "hash" function uses the "SHA" algorithm, which is known to be vulnerable to hash collision attacks. Consider switching to a safer algorithm such as "SHA-256" or "SHA-3".

2. The "encrypt" function uses "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" for ciphering, which is fine for symmetric cryptography. If there is a requirement for non-repudiable encryption or a need to sign data, consider using algorithms such as "RSA" for these purposes.

3. No encryption/decryption key rotation is mentioned in the code. If the encryption keys are compromised, they could be used to decrypt the data.

4. The "obfuscate" and "deobfuscate" functions use some simple transformations for encryption and decryption. These transformations are not secure and can be easily reversed by anyone. Consider using a proven encryption algorithm and approach (e.g., AES with a secure key management).

5. The passwords stored in the properties are neither encrypted nor hashed. Consider using a secure way to store sensitive information.

6. The "getMasterDatabasePassword()" function directly returns the database password. This could potentially be a security issue if the password is stored in plain text. Consider using a secure storage mechanism for passwords.

7. The "obfuscate" and "deobfuscate" functions use hardcoded values for the salt and pass code. These should be generated and stored in a secure manner.

8. The code lacks any mechanism for error handling, input validation, and other security best practices.

Please note, in a professional environment, cryptography is a sensitive topic. Always consult with a security expert when dealing with cryptography.
