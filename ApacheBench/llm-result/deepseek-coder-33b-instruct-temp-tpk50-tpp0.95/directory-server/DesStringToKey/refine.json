Considering the code snippets and analysis provided, it is clear that there are some security misuses that are not applicable due to the specific context and functionality of the provided code. Here are the False Positive Misuse instances, based on the analysis and JSON given:

False Positive Misuse #1:

The CWE-256: Insecure Cryptographic Storage misuse is not applicable because in this context, the checksum isn't used for secure storage. It's just returned without any secure storage or further processing, which wouldn't result in a security vulnerability.

False Positive Misuse #2:

The CWE-297: Use of Null References misuse is not applicable here as there are no methods or code snippets involving `nsae` which could potentially be null. The exception handling in this case is just a logging action, not a security issue.

False Positive Misuse #3:

The CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm misuse is not applicable here as the code uses an encryption algorithm (DES/CBC/NoPadding) that isn't considered broken or risky in the context of cryptographic security. DES is indeed considered broken, but here it's used for an intended purpose of providing a DES key from a passphrase or a specific string (not for real encryption/decryption as per DES/CBC/NoPadding).

Optimized Misuse JSON:

Based on the False Positive Misuse instances and the JSON given, the optimized list of Cryptographic API misuses would be:

```json
[{
    "misuse_category": "Cryptographic Issues",
    "vulnerable_method": "Cipher.getInstance(\"DES/CBC/NoPadding\");",
    "vulnerable_code": "getKey methods",
    "description": "The Cipher object is being created and the method uses the DES algorithm without any mechanism to ensure the integrity and secureness of the used algorithm",
    "recommendation": "Use a proven cryptographic algorithm. Algorithms that are not secure should be avoided whenever possible. If the use of a non-secure algorithm is absolutely necessary, the code should ensure it has been tested thoroughly and is known to be secure."
}, {
    "misuse_category": "Security Misuse",
    "vulnerable_method": "null and blank string checks",
    "vulnerable_code": "getKey methods",
    "description": "The code does not handle null values or blank strings in the \"getKey\" and \"generateKey\" functions. This will cause NullPointerException.",
    "recommendation": "Add checks to ensure that passPhrase is not null and not a blank string."
}, {
    "misuse_category": "Security Misuse",
    "vulnerable_method": "SecurityManager implementation",
    "vulnerable_code": "N/A",
    "description": "It is generally a good practice to have a SecurityManager set, which helps restrict certain operations and makes the code sandbox-based if needed.",
    "recommendation": "Consider adding a SecurityManager to restrict potentially dangerous operations."
}]
