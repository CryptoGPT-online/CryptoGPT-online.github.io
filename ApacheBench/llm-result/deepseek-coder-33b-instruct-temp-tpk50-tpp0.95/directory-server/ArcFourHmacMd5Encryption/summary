After consolidating the duplicates and arranging the information, here's the formatted result:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The ArcFourHmacMd5Encryption class is using an insecure, outdated RC4 (ARCFOUR) encryption algorithm, which is vulnerable to various attacks, and doesn't ensure the confidentiality or integrity of the encrypted data."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "description": "The getEncryptedData method is returning an EncryptedData object without actually encrypting the plaintext, leading to data integrity issues."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Weak Cryptographic Hash",
    "description": "The calculateIntegrity method uses HMAC MD5 which is susceptible to hash collision attacks and is no longer considered secure, limiting the ability to ensure data integrity."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-320: Key Management Errors",
    "description": "The keys used for encryption and MAC computation are not properly protected, potentially compromising their confidentiality."
  }
]
```

Each entry in the JSON array represents a cryptographic API misuse accompanied by a brief description.
