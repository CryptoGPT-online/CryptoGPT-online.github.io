There seems to be a misuse with the Cryptographic Provider in the code provided. The use of an unsupported "AES/CTS/NoPadding" in the Cipher.getInstance method call for Cipher encryption and decryption.

According to Oracle's security updates, AES/CTS is no longer recommended as it has been found to potentially leak data through a timing leakage vulnerability (CVE-2016-109C), as it uses the same Nonce for encrypting and decrypting the same data.

Here't the correct code modification for the encrypt and decrypt methods:

Replace "AES/CTS/NoPadding" with "AES/CBC/PKCS15Padding" for proper padding and initialization vector (IV) usage for encryption and decryption.

This is a problem of using a vulnerable algorithm and it does not use randomized encryption for sensitive data. It's a violation of CWE-338, specifically because the encrypted data is not properly authenticated, thus resulting in susceptible to many attacks. Please consider using a different crypto algorithm that provides authenticated encryption for sensitive data.
