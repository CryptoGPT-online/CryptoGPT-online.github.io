Here is a general suggestion:

CWE-256 - The issue here would be with a fixed encryption key. In many cases, using a fixed key for encryption and decryption is a security risk. A fixed key can be easily discovered through a brute force attack if the key is weak, and the attacker could decrypt and potentially gain access to the data.

It would be better to use a randomly generated key that is stored separately and kept secure. The key should also be encrypted at the time of encryption and decrypted at the time of decryption.

The code does seem to use DESede for encryption which is a weaker algorithm. Consider using a modern algorithm like AES which is more commonly used and recommended.

Additionally, this code is lacking any checksum mechanism to detect if the data has been altered during transmission. Adding a mechanism to ensure integrity (such as a MAC, as in the case here) should be considered.

Given the context, it's not possible to provide an exact list of identified vulnerabilities as those would require a deeper analysis of the code and understanding of the particular threat model.

If possible, consider applying code analysis tools like SonarQube or FindBugs, they can help find potential vulnerabilities in your code.

Here's a suggested fix, you could use a KeyGenerator to generate a random key for encryption and decryption.

KeyGenerator generator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("DESede");
SecretKey key = generator.generateKey();

In this way, you ensure that a unique key is used for encryption and decryption, ensuring the security of your application.

For CWEs 321, 326, 327, you should consider enabling Java's Secure Mode. In particular, this disallows weak cryptographic algorithms. CWE-321 and CWE-327 relate specifically to the lack of a randomized, unique salt for passwords.

CWE-295 is a vulnerability of using hard-coded credentials, where the key or password is hardcoded within a software. Your code does not provide such information, but using hard-coded credentials is never recommended.

Remember, the actual severity of a vulnerability is dependent on the context where the code will be used: the data it encrypts, the software environment where it will run, who has access to it, etc.
