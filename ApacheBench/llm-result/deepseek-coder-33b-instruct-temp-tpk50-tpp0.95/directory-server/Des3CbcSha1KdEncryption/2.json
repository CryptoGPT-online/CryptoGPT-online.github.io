I'm sorry, there aren't any security issues in the provided Java code. However, I can still see some improvements that could be made. For example, the use of static hardcoded values for the IV (Initial Value), the hard-coded checksum length, and the hardcoded key sizes for the encryption and checksum. It would be better to define these values as constants and make them configurable. This would allow for more flexibility in the system and easier modification of these values in the future. Here's how you might do that:

```java
private static final byte[] IV = new byte[]
    { ( byte ) 0x00, ( byte ) 0x00, ( byte ) 0x00, ( byte ) 0x00, ( byte ) 0x00, ( byte ) 0x00, ( byte ) 0x00, ( byte ) 0x00 };

private static final int CONFOUNDER_LENGTH = 8;
private static final int CHECKSUM_LENGTH = 20;
private static final int KEY_LENGTH_N = 64;
private static final int KEY_LENGTH_K = 168;
```

For the derivation of keys, the use of bitwise operations seems confusing and inefficient. It would be better to use a cryptographic function for generating keys and use a salt when necessary.

The use of DESede/CBC/NoPadding is also not recommended as the cipher has been known to be vulnerable to various attacks and it is no longer recommended to use the NoPadding mode. Instead, use a padding scheme such as PKCS1.

It's also worth mentioning that the processCipher method uses a fixed IV, which is not recommended for security purposes. It would be better to use a different IV for every encryption, which can be done using a random number generator.

Lastly, there's no mechanism for handling errors and exceptions in the code. While it's not a security issue, it could be a good practice to make sure that exceptions are handled and that appropriate error messages are logged for debugging purposes.

You can also consider using a well-established cryptographic library or framework, such as Apache Crypto, for handling cryptographic operations. It would make the code easier to read and maintain, and it would have been developed in a way that it minimizes the risk of security vulnerabilities.
