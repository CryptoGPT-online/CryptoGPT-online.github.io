[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "description": "The use of 'DESede/CBC/NoPadding' in Cipher instances across various methods such as 'encrypt', 'processCipher', and 'getDecryptedData' is vulnerable to several types of cryptanalysis attacks, including Linear Cryptanalysis and potential issues with padding oracle attacks due to CBC mode's susceptibility to such attacks when used without proper padding."
 },
 {"misuse": "Improper use of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) data structures",
  "description": "Using 'NoPadding' with DESede/CBC may not provide the expected output because the input data size and output data size are the result of the padding used, which could lead to data corruption or other unintended effects."
 },
 {"misuse": "Hardcoded values and improper key management",
  "description": "The code indicates the potential use of a fixed IV, hardcoded checksum lengths, and potentially static or hardcoded keys, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as predictable IVs leading to certain types of cryptanalysis and risks associated with the use of hardcoded or weak keys."
