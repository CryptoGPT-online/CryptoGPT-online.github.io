There are a few security issues with this code. 

Firstly, the constant "iv" used for the IV (Initialization Vector) for the DES CBC encryption is not random and is hardcoded. This is a security vulnerability known as "static IV" which can potentially lead to predictable keys and, as a result, potentially predictable ciphertext.

Secondly, the code does not seem to take into account "padding" when using the DES algorithm, which is a mandatory requirement for CBC encryption. Java's Cipher class automatically applies padding when needed, but if an incorrect padding mode is set (e.g., Cipher.NO_PADDING), an exception will be thrown.

Here is the JSON response:
