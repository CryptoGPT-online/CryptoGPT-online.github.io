}
```

The response indicates that the application uses the DES (Data Encryption Algorithm) for encryption and the MD5 for integrity check. These are known to be vulnerable and should be replaced with modern cryptographic algorithms like AES.

The recommendation is to replace DES with a safer algorithm, at least to improve the security of the encryption, and speed if needed.

However, this response assumes that the cryptographic algorithms are used in the code, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet. Therefore, please provide the actual implementation details to get a more accurate result.
