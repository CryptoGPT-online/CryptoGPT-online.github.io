After consolidating the duplicated items and rearranging the others, here is the structured format describing the cryptographic API misuses identified:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)",
        "description": "The application uses DES (Data Encryption Algorithm) for encryption, which is vulnerable to exhaustive search attacks and considered outdated. The usage of MD5 for integrity check is also insecure due to its collision vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Use of Cryptographic Misconfiguration",
        "description": "NoPadding mode is being used with DES, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as timing attacks and data corruption. Padding is essential in cryptographic algorithms for data integrity."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "Cryptographic Weakness",
        "description": "Hardcoded and static IVs (Initialization Vectors) are being used in CBC mode. IVs should be random and unique for each encryption to prevent predictability and subsequent attacks."
    }
]
