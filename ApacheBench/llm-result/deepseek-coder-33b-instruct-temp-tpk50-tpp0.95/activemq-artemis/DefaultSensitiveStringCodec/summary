[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "description": "The code uses the 'Blowfish' algorithm, which is considered to be a weak cryptographic algorithm and vulnerable to attacks such as the Sequential Attack."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
  "description": "The secret key is hardcoded in the BlowfishAlgorithm class as 'clusterpassword', presenting a security risk since it's the same across different instances and can be easily compromised."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort",
  "description": "The iteration count for PBKDF2 is set to 1024, which is a relatively low value and might not provide the desired security level."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt OR CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt",
  "description": "The salt in PBKDF2 is either not stored along with the hashed value, potentially leading to loss of the salt, or the salt length is hard-coded to 32, which could be improved to be randomly generated each time."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-327: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
  "description": "The keys used in the 'PBKDF2' and 'Blowfish' algorithms are not long enough and have been hardcoded as 'clusterpassword', thus not meeting appropriate encryption standards."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions",
  "description": "The code lacks proper error handling for the encryption and decryption processes, which could lead to unhandled exceptions and potential security vulnerabilities."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm",
  "description": "The input password during verification is not cleaned or processed, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if used for comparison without proper input validation."},
 {"misuse": "CWE-780: Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP",
  "description": "The code may be missing cryptographic padding, which is needed to ensure secure encryption when using block ciphers."}]
