### False Positives
The provided analysis does not report any false positives for the identified cryptographic API misuses. The usage of Java's Random class for generating random values is a common practice, and it is not necessarily a misuse. The methods provided do not involve cryptographic algorithms or protocols in a way that is insecure.

For instance, the `randomString()` method generates a version 4 UUID, which is not a cryptographic-strength random number. While it could potentially be used in a context where a unique identifier is required (e.g., as a session token), it does not serve any security purpose in this code.

Similarly, the `randomPositiveInt()` and `randomInt()` methods generate random integers, which are not used for cryptographic operations in this code.

### Optimized Misuse JSON
The optimized JSON format misuse report is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "RandomUtil.randomInt()",
    "vulnerable_code": "return RandomUtil.random.nextInt();",
    "description": "The `randomInt()` function uses the Random.nextInt() function which may not be sufficiently random depending on the underlying algorithm.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a cryptographic secure random instead of using java.util.Random. If you need to generate random number sequences for testing, at least do not use it for sensitive cryptographic operations."
  },

    "misuse category": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "vulnerable_method": "RandomUtil.randomPositiveInt()",
    "vulnerable_code": "return Math.abs(RandomUtil.randomInt());",
    "description": "Similar to the previous method, `randomPositiveInt()` uses the Math.abs() function to convert the negative random integer into positive integer. The Math.abs() function is susceptible to the integer overflow problem which is a potential vulnerability in cryptographic applications.",
    "recommendation": "Do not use the Math.abs() function to convert negative random number to positive ones, if the value could potentially be negative."
  },
  {
    "misuse category": "CWE-269: Inadequate Randomness in Generating Random Numbers",
    "vulnerable_method": "RandomUtil.randomByte()",
    "vulnerable_code": "Integer.valueOf(RandomUtil.random.nextInt()).byteValue();",
    "description": "The `randomByte()` function uses the nextInt() function of Random class for generating bytes. The problem is the nextInt() may produce an integer exceeding Integer range thus producing wrong bytes.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using Random.nextBytes() for generating random bytes."
