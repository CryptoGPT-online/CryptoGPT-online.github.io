    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The code uses the non-secure Random class for operations that may require cryptographic strength randomness which is not provided by this class. The Random class uses a linear congruential generator that is not suitable for cryptographic purposes."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Potentially Insecure Cryptographic Protocols or Algorithms",
    "description": "The `randomString()` method generates strings using `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()`. Though UUIDs are not inherently insecure, the use of UUIDs in security-sensitive contexts, such as session IDs or tokens, could pose risks if the UUID generation algorithm is predictable or not cryptographically strong."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-269: Inadequate Randomness in Generating Random Numbers",
    "description": "Methods such as `randomByte()` leverage the `nextInt()` function of the Random class, which may exceed the range of valid byte values and is not cryptographically secure. This could lead to insufficient randomness for cryptographic operations."
