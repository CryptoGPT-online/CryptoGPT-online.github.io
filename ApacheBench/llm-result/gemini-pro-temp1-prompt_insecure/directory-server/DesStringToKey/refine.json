### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-297 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
   **Vulnerable Method:** Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/NoPadding")
   **Vulnerable Code:** Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/NoPadding");
   **Reason:** The misuse report for this potential misuse is a **false positive** because the context in which the DES/CBC/NoPadding cipher is used is for calculating the checksum on the initial passphrase+salt. This is done to generate an intermediate key, which is then used to encrypt the data. The final eight-byte block of the encrypted data is returned as the checksum. In this context, using DES for checksum calculation is not considered a security risk.
