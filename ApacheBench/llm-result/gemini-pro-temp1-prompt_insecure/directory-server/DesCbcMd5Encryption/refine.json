### False Positive Misuse ###

1. **Misuse:** CWE-326
   **Vulnerable method:** calculateIntegrity
   **Vulnerable code:** MessageDigest digester = MessageDigest.getInstance( LdapSecurityConstants.HASH_METHOD_MD5.getAlgorithm() );
   **Description:** MessageDigest instance should be thread local or created per use and not reused.
   **Recommendation:** MessageDigest instance should be thread local or created per use and not reused. There are many ways to achieve this. One possibility is using ThreadLocal.
   **Reason:** This misuse is not applicable because the MessageDigest instance is created per use, not reused.
