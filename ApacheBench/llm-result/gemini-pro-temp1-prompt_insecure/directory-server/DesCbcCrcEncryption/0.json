    "description": "This code hard coded the IV parameter which makes it vulnerable to IV reuse attack. A fixed IV weakens block cipher by allowing an attacker to perform a related-key attack. Furthermore, CBC mode is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks when IV is fixed for different ciphertexts encrypted using the same key (see Sweet32 attack).",
    "recommendation": "Instead of using a fixed IV, generate a random IV for each encryption operation and send it along with the ciphertext. The Initialization Vector (IV) should be unique/random for each encryption and unpredictable."
