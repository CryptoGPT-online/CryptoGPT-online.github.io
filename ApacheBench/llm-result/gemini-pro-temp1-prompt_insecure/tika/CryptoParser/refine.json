### False Positive Misuse ###
1. **Broken Crypto Algorithm (Cipher.getInstance())**: The misuse report flags `Cipher.getInstance()` as vulnerable because it uses a hardcoded `transformation` string. However, the `transformation` string is not hardcoded in this code. It is provided as a parameter to the constructor of the `CryptoParser` class. Therefore, this misuse report is a false positive.
