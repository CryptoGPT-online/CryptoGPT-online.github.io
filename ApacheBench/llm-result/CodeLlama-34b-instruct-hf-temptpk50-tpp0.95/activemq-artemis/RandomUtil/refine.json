 Here is the optimized JSON response without any false positive misuses:

In this JSON response, we have removed the false positive misuses and kept only the relevant misuses. The misuses are categorized based on the CWE category and the vulnerable method is provided along with the vulnerable code snippet. We also provide a description of the misuse and a recommendation on how to fix it.
