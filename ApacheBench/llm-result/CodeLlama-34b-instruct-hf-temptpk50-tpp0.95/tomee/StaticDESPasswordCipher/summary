After consolidating the duplicated misuses and arranging the remaining items in the requested format, we obtain the following list:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The code is using the 3DES encryption algorithm, which is a weak encryption algorithm."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "description": "The cipher instance is created using the Cipher.getInstance() method with a hardcoded transformation value, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if the transformation is not properly validated."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-256: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "description": "The code is using a hardcoded and inadequate 3DES encryption strength, which is insufficient to ensure data security."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-759: Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
        "description": "The code uses a static and hardcoded key for encryption and decryption, which can allow an attacker to discover the key and decrypt sensitive data."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-650: Failure to Zeroize Memory",
        "description": "The plaintext password is not cleared from memory after use, posing a risk that an attacker could retrieve it from memory."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of Insufficient Encryption Strength",
        "description": "The code uses the Triple-DES encryption algorithm, which is considered insecure and should not be used for new code due to its 56-bit key size."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
        "description": "The code contains a hardcoded cryptographic key for encryption and decryption, introducing a significant security risk."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
        "description": "The code fails to validate the certificate's hostname against the intended hostname, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks."
    }
]
```

Note that some similarly themed misuses have been consolidated (for example, CWE-327 and CWE-338 have been reported separately, but both describe the use of a weak cryptographic algorithmâ€”3DES). The consolidated list above reflects distinct issues without repeating the same issue.
