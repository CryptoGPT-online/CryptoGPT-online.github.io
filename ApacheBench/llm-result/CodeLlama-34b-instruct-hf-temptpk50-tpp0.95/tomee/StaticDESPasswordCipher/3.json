{"misuse": "CWE-256: Use of Incorrect ECE in Appointment Scheduling",
"vulnerable_method": "StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt()",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(plaintext);",
"description": "The cipher.doFinal() method is used for both encryption and decryption, which can lead to incorrect data being encrypted or decrypted. This can cause data integrity issues or even allow unauthorized users to access sensitive information.",
"recommendation": "Use a different method for encryption and decryption, such as Cipher.update() for encryption and Cipher.doFinal() for decryption."},

{"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
"vulnerable_method": "StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt()",
"vulnerable_code": "final Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION);",
"description": "The cipher instance is created using the Cipher.getInstance() method with a hardcoded transformation value. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the transformation is not properly validated, as an attacker could potentially modify the transformation value to exploit a known vulnerability in the cipher algorithm.",
"recommendation": "Always validate the transformation value to ensure that it is a known and secure cipher algorithm. You can use the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) providers to validate the transformation value."},

"vulnerable_method": "StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt()",
"vulnerable_code": "final String plaintext = plainPassword.getBytes();",
"description": "The plaintext password is used as part of an SQL command without being sanitized, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.",
"recommendation": "Always sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL command to prevent SQL injection attacks."},
