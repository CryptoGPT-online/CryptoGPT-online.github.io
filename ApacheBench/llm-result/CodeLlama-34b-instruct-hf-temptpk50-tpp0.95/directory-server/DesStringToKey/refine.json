 Here is the false positive misuse:

{
"misuse": "CWE-759: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
"vulnerable_method": "DesStringToKey.generateKey",
"vulnerable_code": "byte[] secretKey = fanFold( paddedByteArray );",
"description": "The function generates a DES key without proper salting, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
"recommendation": "Implement proper salting when generating the DES key to protect against security vulnerabilities."
}
