Below is a consolidated and arranged list of potential cryptographic API misuses in the described Java files:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "Multiple instances indicate the usage of weak cryptographic algorithms like Triple DES (3DES), DESede, and HmacSHA1 which are considered broken or risky due to their susceptibility to attacks, small key sizes, or lack of integrity checks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "description": "There is a failure to perform proper certificate validation which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Certificate Validation / Weak or Broken Key Derivation Function",
        "description": "The code does not check the revocation status of certificates and uses weak key derivation functions which can be vulnerable to exploits due to deterministic methods."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The code uses HmacSHA1 algorithm for calculating checksums, which is no longer recommended."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-547: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "description": "The code utilizes a random number generator that may not be cryptographically secure, increasing the risk of predictable values that can be exploited."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757/759/760: Use of Insufficiently Random Values / Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "Repeated issues with static values being used for random seed generation with algorithms like DES3. This practice can be vulnerable to attacks, highlighting the need for secure randomness."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-650: Failure to Zeroize De-Allocated Memory",
        "description": "The code does not zero out de-allocated memory before setting new values, which can lead to data leakage."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage / Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The code stores some data in plaintext and utilizes the DESede encryption algorithm, which lacks integrity and confidentiality measures."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-760: Use of One-Way Hash Without Integrity Check",
        "description": "The checksum generation method does not perform integrity checks, making it vulnerable to undetected data manipulation."
    }WI

```

The list consolidates repeated CWE instances and contains refined descriptions to cover the overlapping security concerns among the different misuse types. It ensures that all unique misuses are captured and that duplicated ones are merged. Recommendations for each case generally include adopting stronger cryptographic practices, using secure algorithms like AES, implementing proper validation and integrity checks, and using secure sources of randomness.
