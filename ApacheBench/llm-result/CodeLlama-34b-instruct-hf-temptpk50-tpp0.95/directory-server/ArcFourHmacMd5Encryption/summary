After consolidating the duplicated types and arranging the unique ones according to the format provided, the resulting JSON array is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "description": "The use of the ARCFOUR encryption algorithm is insecure due to vulnerabilities such as CipherBlockChaining (CBC) Forgery Attacks, FluentDetection, and the FLUSH+RELOAD cache timing attack. The RC4_HMAC encryption algorithm is also weak and can be easily broken, making it susceptible to similar attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch.",
        "description": "The code fails to validate the domain name of the encryption key, potentially allowing an attacker to utilize fraudulent keys for encryption or decryption."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-338: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "description": "The use of 'HmacMD5' as a message authentication code is not recommended due to security flaws such as Replay Attacks and Collision Attacks. HMAC-MD5 is weak and vulnerable to attacks such as the length-extension and collision attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-650: Failure to Sanitize Data into an XML Document.",
        "description": "The construction of an XML document through the 'EncryptedData' constructor is susceptible to XML external entity injection, leading to possible Denial of Service (DoS) or Information Disclosure."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
        "description": "There is an absence of proper validation for the authenticity of the encryption key. Furthermore, the HmacMD5 algorithm is used for message authentication without proper certificate validation."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key.",
        "description": "Hard-coding cryptographic keys in the source code makes the application vulnerable to attacks, as the key might be extracted by an attacker, and it lacks flexibility for key rotation and key management."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-256: Unprotected Transport of Sensitive Information.",
        "description": "Sensitive information is transmitted over the network without proper encryption, exposing it to potential interception by attackers."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "description": "Weak encryption key versions are used, which can be easily broken, thus compromising the encryption's effectiveness."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-547: Improper Use of Key Exchange.",
        "description": "A weak encryption algorithm, RC4_HMAC, is used for key exchange, which affects the security of the data being encrypted."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "description": "The RC4_HMAC encryption algorithm used is weak and can be cracked with relative ease, exposing it to various attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "description": "The keyBytes variable used is not cryptographically secure, making it predictable, which jeopardizes the security of the encryption process."
    }
]
```

Please note, some CWE entries might be reported with slightly different numbers across sources but describe the same or very similar issues, like CWE-327 and CWE-256, which both refer to the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms but are listed differently in the provided misuse lists.
