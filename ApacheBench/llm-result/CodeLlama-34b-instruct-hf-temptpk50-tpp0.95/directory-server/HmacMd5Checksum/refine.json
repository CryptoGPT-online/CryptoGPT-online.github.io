 ### False Positive Misuses

{
"misuses": [
{
"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
"vulnerable_method": "HmacMd5Checksum.calculateChecksum",
"vulnerable_code": "Mac.getInstance( \"HmacMD5\" );",
"description": "The code uses the HmacMD5 algorithm, which is a weak hash function and can be easily broken. It is recommended to use a stronger hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead.",
"recommendation": "Use a stronger hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 in place of HmacMD5."
},
{
"misuse": "CWE-256: Use of a Hidden Function",
"vulnerable_method": "HmacMd5Checksum.calculateChecksum",
"vulnerable_code": "mac.doFinal( data );",
"description": "The code uses the doFinal() method of the Mac class, which is not part of the standard Java API and may be hidden from the public API.",
"recommendation": "Use the standard update() method of the Mac class instead of the doFinal() method."
