{"misuse": "CWE-256: Unprotected Transport of Sensitive Data",
"vulnerable_method": "parse(InputStream, ContentHandler, Metadata, ParseContext) in CryptoParser class",
"vulnerable_code": "new CipherInputStream(stream, cipher)",

"vulnerable_method": "parse(InputStream, ContentHandler, Metadata, ParseContext) in CryptoParser class",
"vulnerable_code": "Provider provider = context.get(Provider.class);",
"description": "The method retrieves a Provider instance from the ParseContext without validating its authenticity. This may lead to the use of a tampered or compromised Provider, resulting in untrusted or malicious cryptographic operations.",

"vulnerable_method": "parse(InputStream, ContentHandler, Metadata, ParseContext) in CryptoParser class",
"vulnerable_code": "super.parse(new CipherInputStream(stream, cipher), handler, metadata, context);",
"description": "The method passes untrusted input data (i.e., the CipherInputStream) to an XML parser without sanitizing it. This may lead to XML injection attacks.",
