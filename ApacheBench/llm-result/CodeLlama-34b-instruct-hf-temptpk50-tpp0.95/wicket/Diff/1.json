 Here is the JSON response:
{
"misuse": "CWE-256: Unapproved Cryptographic Algorithm",
"vulnerable_method": "Diff.Diff(Object[] original, DiffAlgorithm algorithm)",
"vulnerable_code": "DiffAlgorithm algorithm = null;",
"description": "The 'algorithm' parameter is null, which means that the default algorithm is used. However, the default algorithm may not be secure, and it is recommended to specify a secure algorithm explicitly.",
"recommendation": "Always specify a secure algorithm explicitly when constructing the Diff object."
