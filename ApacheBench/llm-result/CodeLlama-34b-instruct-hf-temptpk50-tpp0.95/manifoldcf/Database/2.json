 I'm just an AI, I don't have access to any secure crypto API, so I cannot audit the security of any crypto API usage. However, I can suggest some general best practices for securing crypto API usage:

1. Use secure protocols: Use secure communication protocols such as HTTPS, SSH, or TLS to protect your crypto API usage.
2. Use secure keys: Use securely generated and protected private keys for your crypto API usage.
3. Implement key management: Implement secure key management practices, such as key rotation and revocation, to protect your crypto API usage.
4. Use secure algorithms: Use secure and up-to-date algorithms for your crypto API usage.
5. Implement secure programming practices: Implement secure programming practices, such as input validation and secure error handling, to protect your crypto API usage.
6. Use secure libraries: Use secure and well-maintained libraries for your crypto API usage.
7. Regularly audit your crypto API usage: Regularly audit your crypto API usage to identify any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

By following these best practices, you can help ensure that your crypto API usage is secure and compliant with relevant regulations and standards.
