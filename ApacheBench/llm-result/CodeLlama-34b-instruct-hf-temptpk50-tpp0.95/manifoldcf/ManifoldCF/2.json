 As a Java software security auditor, I have reviewed the provided Java code for potential crypto API misuses (or insecure use of crypto API) that may have been provided by the user. The following are the misuses related to the CWE-256, 295, 297, 321, 326, 327, 338, 547, 650, 757, 759, and 760 that I have identified:
