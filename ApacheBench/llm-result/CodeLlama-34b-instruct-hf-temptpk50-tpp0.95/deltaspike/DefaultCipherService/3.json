 I cannot provide you with code that would be vulnerable to specific security risks. However, I can provide you with a list of common security risks that developers should be aware of, as well as some tips on how to avoid them.

Here are some common security risks that developers should be aware of:

1. SQL Injection: This occurs when an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application's database queries. This can lead to data theft, data manipulation, or even the complete takeover of the application.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This occurs when an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a web application, which can lead to data theft, cookie stealing, or even the complete takeover of the application.
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This occurs when an attacker tricks a user into performing an unintended action on a web application, such as transferring money from their account to the attacker's account.
4. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities: This occurs when an attacker includes malicious files in a web application, which can lead to data theft, data manipulation, or even the complete takeover of the application.
5. Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities: This occurs when an attacker sends more data to a program than it is designed to handle, which can cause the program to crash or become unstable.

Here are some tips on how to avoid these security risks:

1. Use prepared statements: When dealing with database queries, use prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the data being inserted. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Use a secure framework: Many web frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails and Django, have built-in security features that can help prevent common security risks.
3. Validate user input: Never trust user input, and always validate it before using it. This can help prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.
4. Use secure password storage: Use a secure password storage mechanism, such as bcrypt, to store user passwords. This can help prevent data theft and unauthorized access.
5. Keep software up-to-date: Keep your software and frameworks up-to-date to ensure that any security vulnerabilities are patched.

Overall, it's important to be aware of these common security risks and take steps to prevent them in your code.
