        "vulnerable_code": "if ( DESKeySpec.isWeak( secretKey, 0 ) ) { secretKey[7] ^= 0xf0; }",
        "description": "The method getStrongKey uses DESKeySpec.isWeak to check if a secret key is weak and then corrects it by XOR'ing with 0xF0. However, DES is known to be a broken cryptographic algorithm, and it should not be used for security-sensitive applications.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure and modern cryptographic algorithm such as AES instead of DES."
