        "vulnerable_method": "CryptoParser.parse",
        "vulnerable_code": "cipher = Cipher.getInstance(transformation, provider);",
        "description": "The code uses the Cipher.getInstance method that takes a provider parameter, which allows the selection of a cryptographic algorithm and provider. This can lead to the selection of a less-secure algorithm during negotiation.",
        "recommendation": "Use Cipher.getInstance(transformation) method without the provider parameter to ensure a more secure algorithm selection."
