        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in these methods is vulnerable to attacks and not recommended for use. It combines DES, a weak cryptographic algorithm, and MD5 for the password derivation function, which is also known to be insecure. The use of 'PBEWithMD5AndDES' makes the encryption weaker and over-reliance on static, predictable information such as host name for salt also diminishes security."

        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The DES algorithm is insecure due to its short key length and vulnerabilities to brute-force attacks. It has been deprecated in favor of stronger algorithms such as AES."

        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "description": "The salt for the encryption/decryption is not sufficiently random and is derived from predictable information like the machine's host name or properties of the user's home directory. This potentially makes the encryption keys predictable."
