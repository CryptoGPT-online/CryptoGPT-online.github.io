    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "vulnerable_method": "encrypt(), decrypt(), doEncryption() methods in the class Util",
    "vulnerable_code": "PBEWithMD5AndDES",
    "description": "The cryptographic algorithm used in these methods is vulnerable to attacks and not recommended for use. It uses DES, a weak cryptographic algorithm and MD5 for the password derivation function, which is a known vulnerability. Moreover, the salt is derived from the local host's name, making it susceptible to attacks that have been made aware of this specific usage. This may lead to decreased security and integrity of the encrypted data.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a stronger algorithm (e.g., AES) for encryption and a robust password derivation function (e.g., SHA2) instead of using MD5. Also, ensure the salt used for encryption is secure and has high enough length."
