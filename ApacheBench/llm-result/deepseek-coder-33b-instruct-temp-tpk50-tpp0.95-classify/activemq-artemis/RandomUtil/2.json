I've checked the code and found that the CWE-330 issue with the use of insufficiently random values in the Random.java class and the lack of seeding of Random() object.

The `random` object in the class is declared with the "static" keyword which is shared across all instances of the class. This makes the sequence of numbers generated by the random object unnecessarily predictable and vulnerable to attackers. If any sensitive information were being derived from random numbers in a way that could be exploited, it would be vulnerable to attack if it was used on an application running with access to multiple threads.

Also, the random numbers in the application are not properly seeded, potentially making the random number sequence predictable.

Below is the JSON response with the suggestions for improvements and the mappings:

[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_method": "RandomUtil.random()",
        "vulnerable_code": "protected static final Random random = new Random();",
        "description": "The random numbers used in the application are not properly seeded and are not used in a secure manner.",
        "recommendation": "Use a seed that changes over time (such as a value derived from the system clock) to improve the quality of the randomness. If the seed is deterministic (e.g., always the same), it's effectively the same as using the default constructor. Use java.util.Random instead, which uses a more robust algorithm."
