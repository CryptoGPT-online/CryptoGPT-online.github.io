Misuses found in the code are as below:

1. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
Misused methods: randomLong()
Vulnerable code: `public static long randomLong() { return RandomUtil.random.nextLong(); }`
Description: The java.util.Random class does not generate cryptographic-quality random numbers.
Recommendation: Instead of using Random.nextLong(), consider using java.security.SecureRandom or a library that provides cryptographic randomness.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Valels.
Misused methods: randomByte()
Vulnerable code: `public static byte randomByte() { return Integer.valueOf(RandomUtil.random.nextInt()).byteValue(); }`
Description: The java.util.Random class does not generate cryptographic-quality random numbers.
Recommendation: Instead of using Random.nextInt(), consider using java.security.SecureRandom or a library that provides cryptographic randomness.

3. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.
Misused methods: randomBytes() and randomBytes(int length)
Vulnerable code: `public static byte[] randomBytes() { return RandomUtil.randomString().getBytes(); }
public static byte[] randomBytes(final int length) { byte[] bytes = new byte[length]; for (int i = 0ouble randomDouble() { return RandomUtil.random.nextDouble(); }
public static float randomFloat() { return RandomUtil.random.nextFloat(); }
Description: These methods create byte arrays and do not provide a high level of randomness.
Recommendation: Use java.security.SecureRandom to generate random bytes and make sure the generated byte array length is appropriate for the context of the application.

These CWE vulnerabilities are important to address when the code is used to generate random values for cryptographic purposes, as they could lead to vulnerabilities in the system's security.

For instance, randomBytes() and randomBytes(int length) are generating random bytes using a method that does not guarantee high security randomness, while randomLong() and randomByte() are using java.util.Random that does not provide enough security. The recommended alternative for generating random bytes is using java.security.SecureRandom.

These warnings are important because the lack of security in the randomness generation will potentially impact the overall security of the code.

Note: The exact recommendations might vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the code.
