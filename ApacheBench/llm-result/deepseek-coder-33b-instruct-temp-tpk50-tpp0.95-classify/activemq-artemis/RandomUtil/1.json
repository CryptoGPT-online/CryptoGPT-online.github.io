Here are some instances of CWE vulnerability:

CWE-277: Omitted Validation of the Address Field for High-Level Security Logging.
- There is no direct usage here but some uses of this API in classes would need a validation of the server address for security purposes.

CWE-336: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG (Psuedo Random Number Generator)
- The use of the java Random class for generating random values. This class uses a relatively simple algorithm for generating random numbers, known as a linear congruential generator, which is not suitable for generating cryptographic random numbers.

CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
- There is no cryptography involved here, but users of this API would need to validate that they are not using any known vulnerable or unsafe algorithms (e.g., DES, MD5, SHA1, etc.) for cryptographic purposes.

None of these issues can be identified without the specific context or use of this class so I will provide a rough analysis based on the code provided:

Here is an instance of CWE-277, please note that it should be manually checked:
```java
public static int randomPort() {
      return RandomUtil.random.nextInt(65536);
   }
```
It's possible that this method is being used to generate a random port number, in this case, CWE-277 applies. The application might be logging these values without checking if the address of the server is valid.

For CWE-336 and CWE-327, as mentioned previously, the validation and use of cryptographic libraries must be checked in the caller's context and according to the cryptographic policies of the application.

CWE is a broad classification, the actual risk depends on the specific usage of the utilities. Therefore, it needs to be reviewed in the context of the whole system and the cryptographic algorithms and practices used.
