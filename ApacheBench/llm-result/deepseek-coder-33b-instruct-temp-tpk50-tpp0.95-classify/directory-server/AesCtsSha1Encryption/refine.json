Based on the given Java code, I have analyzed and reported several misuses of the cryptographic API. These include:

## False Positives
1. The provided code has hardcoded keys, which are not recommended for a production environment.
2. Incorrect usage of padding, while it's true that CTS mode does involve padding, but 'NoPadding' is still a bad practice because it enables padding attacks.
3. Lack of input validation and error handling in the code.
4. Use of hardcoded IV (Initialization Vector) in CTR mode (Counter mode) which is also a bad practice and could lead to vulnerabilities.

```
In the code, there are no direct issues with the cryptographic misuse. These are false positives as suggested in the code. For complete security, consult with security experts for understanding the exact vulnerabilities and their remediation.
