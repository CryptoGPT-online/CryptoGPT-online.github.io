Here is the list of issues and their details:

1. **"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"**

The method `randomToKey` in class "Des3CbcSha1KdEncryption" uses the deprecated Cryptographic API (deprecated since Java 8). Specifically, this method is using javax.crypto.Mac class to create a MAC (Message Authentication Code), which is an instance of a HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) algorithm. As HMAC uses the underlying block size of the hash function, a key size that is a multiple of the block size is recommended. In this method, the key size is 24 bytes, which is not a multiple of the block size of the SHA-1 hash function.

**Vulnerable Method:** 

- randomToKey( byte[] seed ) in class Des3CbcSha1KdEncryption.

**Description:**
The key used in the HMAC function, specifically in the getBitGroup() and setParity() methods, is not correctly adapted to the block size of the underlying hash function, leading to a potential risk of incorrect or inadequate key size.

**Recommendation:**
Consider using a modern cryptographic algorithm that supports the desired key size, or adapt the key to the hash function's block size.

2. **"Improper Certificate Validation"**

There are no certificate validation processes or checks in the provided code. If this code is a part of a system that involves SSL/TLS, you should consider implementing certificate validation to prevent potential attacks.

3. **"Use of Insufficiently Random Values"**

In the `getDecryptedData()` and `getEncryptedData()` methods in class "Des3CbcSha1KdEncryption", the method `getRandomBytes()` is used to generate a confounder, but the randomness of the generated bytes is not validated or checked. If the generated bytes are not random, the ciphertext will not be adequately randomized and the cryptographic operations will not be secure.

**Vulnerable Method:
getDecryptedData(), getEncryptedData() in class Des3CbcSha1KdEncryption.

**Description:**
The ciphertext structure is built using a pseudo-random generator (PRNG) that might be inadequately seeded or does not provide the necessary level of randomness for cryptographic operations.

**Recommendation:**
Consider using a cryptographic-safe random generator for generating the confounder or any other sensitive random values.

4. **"Inadequate Encryption Strength"**

The DES algorithm is used for encryption and decryption in the provided code. DES is a weak algorithm and is no longer considered secure for most purposes.

**Vulnerable Method:
encrypt(), decrypt() in class Des3CbcSha1KdEncryption.

**Description:**
The DES algorithm is used for encryption and decryption, which is a weak algorithm and is no longer considered secure for most purposes.

**Recommendation:**
Consider using a stronger algorithm for encryption and decryption, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

These are the issues I found in the provided code. Please note that it's always important to consult with a security expert to ensure the correct and appropriate use of cryptographic algorithms and methods.
