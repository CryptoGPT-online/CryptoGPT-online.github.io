The code you provided seems to be an implementation of the DES (Data Encryption System) string-to-key function for the Kerberos protocol. It implements the string-to-key transformation based on the principles outlined in the "Encryption and Checksum Specifications for Kerberos 5" RFC.

However, there are several security issues that can be found in this implementation. The first issue is that the `setBit` and `getBit` methods are ineffective as they do not modify the correct bit in the byte. To fix it, these methods should use bitwise shift operators instead of bitwise and and or operators.

Another issue is the usage of DES encryption for generating a checksum. While this may not seem like an issue for generating a checksum, it actually introduces an additional vulnerability. Using DES to create a checksum is vulnerable to timing attacks, which can potentially reveal the correct checksum.

The fix would be to use a simpler method such as a simple hash function like SHA256 for the checksum calculation.

Here is the corrected code for the `getBit` and `setBit` methods:

```java
protected int getBit(byte[] data, int pos) {
    int posByte = pos / 8;
    int posBit = pos % 8;

    byte valByte = data[posByte];
    int valInt = valByte >> (7 - posBit) & 0x01;
    return valInt;
}

protected void setBit(byte[] data, int pos, int val) {
    int posByte = pos / 8;
    int posBit = pos % 8;
    byte oldByte = data[posByte];
    oldByte = (byte)((0xFF7F >> posBit) & oldByte);
    byte newByte = (byte)((val << (7 - posBit)) | oldByte);
    data[posByte] = newByte;
}
```

Then, for the checksum calculation, instead of using DES encryption, you could use a hash function like SHA256:

```java
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

...

protected byte[] calculateChecksum(byte[] data, byte[] keyBytes) {
    try {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        byte[] checksum = md.digest(data);
        return checksum;
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}
```

These changes would improve the robustness of the implementation against certain cryptographic attacks.

However, note that you're still using a DES key to encrypt the checksum and the use of DES is still considered vulnerable to many attacks. You might want to consider using stronger algorithms, such as AES for encryption and HMAC for authentication.

Also, in modern systems, you should consider using established cryptographic libraries and functions. If the functionality is not available in a library, it is likely that it has been thoroughly tested and considered secure.

Making sure you use trusted cryptographic libraries and functions can help to reduce the likelihood of security vulnerabilities in your code.
