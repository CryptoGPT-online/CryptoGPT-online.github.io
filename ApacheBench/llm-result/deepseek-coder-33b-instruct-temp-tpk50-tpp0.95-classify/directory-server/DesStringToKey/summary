    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "description": "DES is an outdated and insecure cryptographic algorithm vulnerable to several types of attacks, including brute force due to its short key length. The code uses a getStrongKey method that employs DES and attempts to correct weak keys but still relies on DES's deprecated functionality."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "description": "The method calculateChecksum uses DES/CBC/NoPadding, which lacks appropriate encryption strength. DES is too weak, and the lack of padding can lead to issues for data that is not a multiple of the block size. Moreover, the absence of salt makes the scheme susceptible to attacks such as rainbow tables."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
    "description": "The code does not validate keys before using them, which could lead to encryption with a weak or compromised key, undermining the security of the data."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "Use of Codified Bitwise operations",
    "description": "The setBit and getBit methods use codified bitwise operations without proper input validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security weaknesses."
