Based on the provided misuse lists, the recurring issues seem to be with the use of the DES algorithm, the use of a static initialization vector (IV), and the use of MD5 for integrity checks. Here's the consolidated list of cryptographic API misuses, without duplicates and formatted as requested:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The code is using the DES algorithm, which is considered weak and vulnerable to brute force attacks. Furthermore, the MD5 hash function used for integrity checks is prone to collision attacks, making it insecure."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "description": "The initialization vector (IV) is hardcoded and static across different encryption operations, which makes the encryption predictable and vulnerable to certain types of attacks. This could lead to ciphertext that is susceptible to decryption without the need for a key."
    }
]
```

Recommendations to address the above misuses include:
- Switching from DES to a more secure symmetric encryption algorithm like AES.
- Using a secure hash algorithm like SHA-256 instead of MD5 for integrity checks.
- Generating a random IV for each encryption operation using a secure random number generator, and securely transmitting the IV alongside the ciphertext for proper decryption.
