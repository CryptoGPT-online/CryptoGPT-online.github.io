  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "vulnerable_method": "getEncryptedData() and getDecryptedData() from the class DesCbcCrcEncryption",
    "vulnerable_code": "Encryption algorithm used is DES (Data Encryption Standard) which is known to be less secure then other algorithms.",
    "description": "The DES algorithm is used for encryption. DES is considered a weak algorithm and is no longer recommended for use. It uses a key length of 64 bits, which is too short for todayâ€™s purposes.",
    "recommendation": "Consider using a more secure encryption algorithm. It can be AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or algorithms like RSA, SHA, or others. These are algorithms with more bits in their key lengths."

    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_method": "getRandomBytes() in the class DesCbcCrcEncryption",
    "vulnerable_code": "The method getRandomBytes() uses a fixed byte array as a seed for random bytes.",
    "description": "The method getRandomBytes() uses a fixed byte array as a seed for random bytes. This leads to predictable values and is a security weakness if the output is used as an encryption key.",
    "recommendation": "Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate keys or other sensitive data."
