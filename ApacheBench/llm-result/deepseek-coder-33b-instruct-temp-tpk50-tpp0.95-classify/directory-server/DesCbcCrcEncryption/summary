    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "description": "Multiple instances of using DES, a known weak encryption algorithm susceptible to various attacks such as brute-force, are present within the provided methods. DES_CBC_CRC and DES/CBC/NoPadding implementations are outdated and vulnerable."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
    "description": "The usage of DES indicates inadequate encryption strength due to its short key length of 64 bits. There are instances in the 'padString()' method that could also introduce vulnerabilities as padding the plaintext data for DES is not necessary and could be exploited through timing attacks."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "description": "The method 'getRandomBytes()' uses a fixed byte array as a seed, which leads to the generation of predictable values that compromise the system if used for cryptographic purposes like generating encryption keys."
