Here are the issues found in your code.

1. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
    Misuse Class : StaticDESPasswordCipher
    Misuse Method: encrypt() and decrypt()
    Misuse Code Snippet: `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION);`
    Description: The transformation used for creating the cipher object is "DESede", which is a weak algorithm known for vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use a more secure algorithm like "AES".
    Recommendation: Update the transformation to "AES" or any other recommended cryptographic algorithm.

2. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.
    Misuse Class : org.apache.openejb.cipher.PasswordCipher
    Misuse Method: encrypt() and decrypt()
    Misuse Code Snippet: `_3desData` variable
    Description: The `_3desData` variable in your code contains hardcoded values, it's a potential vulnerability as if someone gets access to the code, then they have hardcoded password.
    Recommendation: Do not hardcode sensitive information or use static passwords. Use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive data.
