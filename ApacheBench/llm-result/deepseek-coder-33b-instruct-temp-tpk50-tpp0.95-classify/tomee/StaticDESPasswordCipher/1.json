The code you provided appears to use DESede (3DES) encryption with a hard-coded key, which is not a good practice for security. The key is specified as a hard-coded byte array named "_3desData". This key should be randomly generated and stored in a secure way. Furthermore, the cipher instance is created and the encryption/decryption modes are initialized at the beginning of every encrypt/decrypt operation. This is a resource-intensive operation and it would be better to create the cipher once and use it for multiple encrypt/decrypt operations. The decryption operation also uses the `String.valueOf` method to convert the char array to a String and then to byte array, this can potentially cause issues with encodings and characters.

Here's the JSON response for the above:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "vulnerable_method": "StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt(), StaticDESPasswordCipher.decrypt()",
        "vulnerable_code": "SecretKeySpec Key = new SecretKeySpec (_3desData, \"DESede\");",
        "description": "The code uses DESede encryption with a hard-coded key which is risky and not secure.",
        "recommendation": "The key used for encryption should be randomly generated and stored in a secure manner. The Cipher instance should be created once and used for multiple operations."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "vulnerable_method": "StaticDESPasswordCipher.encrypt(), StaticDESPasswordCipher.decrypt()",
        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION);",
        "description": "The code uses the transformation string to decide the algorithm to use, which could lead to the use of less secure algorithms during negotiation.",
        "recommendation": "The transformation should be hard-coded to the specific algorithm used by the application."
    }
]
```

For the second issue (selection of less-secure algorithm during negotiation), it seems like the transformation is hard-coded to DESede in your application, so there should be no issues with selection of less-secure algorithms during negotiation in this case. But, if there is a possibility for changing the transformation dynamically based on the situation, then a warning should be issued in this case.

Please note, these are general issues, the code might be fine for a specific context or use case.
