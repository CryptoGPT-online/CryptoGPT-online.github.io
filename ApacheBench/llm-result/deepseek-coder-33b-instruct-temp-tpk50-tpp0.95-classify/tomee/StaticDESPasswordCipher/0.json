I have identified the misuses in the provided code. Here they are:

1. Using the DESede encryption algorithm which is a 3-DES (Three-way DES) instead of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). DES is a very weak algorithm, easily broken by modern computers.

Code part:
```java
private static final byte[] _3desData = {
    (byte) 0x76, (byte) 0x6F, (byte)...
};

private static final SecretKeySpec KEY = new Secret KeySpec(_3desData, "DESede");

private static final String TRANSFORMATION = "DESede";

```

Description: This uses the DESede algorithm for encryption, which is susceptible to attacks and less effective as compared to AES.

Recommendation: Use AES encryption algorithm instead of DESede.


2. Hardcoded Credentials.

Code part:
```java
private static final byte[] _3desData = {
    (byte) 0x76, (byte) 0x6F, (byte)...
};

private static final SecretKeySpec KEY = new Secret KeySpec(_3desData, "DESede");
```

Description: The hardcoded credentials used for encryption and decryption are weak, and can be easily identified in the code.

Recommendation: Never hardcode credentials. Instead, use secure key vault services.


3. Not Using Initialization Vector (IV) in the Cipher

Code part:
```java.
// Initialize Cipher for encryption/decryption
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, KEY);
```

Description: Using an unsafe cipher without an IV (Initialization Vector) can be vulnerable to a number of attacks.

Recommendation: Use SecureRandom to generate a random IV and use it for encryption/decryption.

These are the misuses in the provided code. Please note that these issues are extremely critical and may lead to vulnerabilities if exploited.

Therefore, the reported misuses need to be addressed as soon as possible.

Please replace the code with the AES algorithm, and use secure key vault services for credentials, and use random IVs for encryption.
