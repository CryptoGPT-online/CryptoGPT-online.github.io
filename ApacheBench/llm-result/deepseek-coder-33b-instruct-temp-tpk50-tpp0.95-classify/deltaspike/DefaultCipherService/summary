[{"misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "description": "SHA-256 is used for hashing, which is considered less secure than SHA-512 or higher. It is recommended to switch to a more secure hashing algorithm."
 },
 {"misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
  "description": "The code does not perform certificate validation when communicating over a network or loading properties files, which could lead to trust issues or man-in-the-middle attacks."
 },
 {"misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "description": "The 'secureHash' and 'aesEncrypt' methods are using non-secure, fixed, or inadequate sources of randomness for salts and IVs, which compromises the security of the encryption."
 },
 {"misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
  "description": "The AES encryption uses a fixed-sized key (16 bytes) which may result in weaker encryption. Using a longer key size, in this case, a 256-bit key, would be more secure."
 },
 {"misuse": "CWE-757: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt",
  "description": "The hashing method does not use a salt when creating hashes, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks and hash collisions due to unsalted hash computations."
