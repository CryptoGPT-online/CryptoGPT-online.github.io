The code you provided uses a number of cryptographic algorithms and practices which are not recommended for use due to various security issues. Here are the specific issues:

- CWE-327: The use of the "SHA-256" algorithm for secure hash is not considered safe anymore. Instead, the SHA-2 family should be used.

- CWE-330: The "secureHash" method uses a salt value in a non-secure way. The salt hash is just hashed without using any salt. This is a potential security risk, as it allows an attacker to use the same input values to produce identical outputs.

- CWE-757: The AES encryption algorithm is used without any authentication, allowing attackers to modify the encrypted data.

The corrected code would be written in such way that it implements the best practices for cryptography.

Please note: The corrections will need to be implemented carefully, as changing cryptographic algorithms and configurations might lead to compatibility issues with existing data.

Here are some alternative suggestions:

1. Use SHA-256 or better algorithms for hashing.
2. Use a salt with secure hashing.
3. Use a dedicated Cryptography library such as Spring Security or Apache Crypto instead of raw crypto libraries.
4. Use secure, authenticated encryption algorithms such as AES with GCM (Galois Counter Mode) instead of raw AES.
5. Ensure secure handling and storage of encryption keys.

The above recommendations are just suggestions to improve the security of the code, they do not fix the actual issues in the code you provided.
