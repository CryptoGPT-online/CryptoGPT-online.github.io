The JSON output for identified crypto API misuses in the provided code:

        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "vulnerable_method": "aesDecrypt",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] pwdHash = secureHash(password);",
       "description": "The password hash for AES encryption is derived from user input without checking the quality of randomness in the password. If the hash value is predictable or weak, the security of the encryption will be compromised.",
        "recommendation": "Use a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 for password hashing, ensuring that the resulting hash value is sufficiently random and difficult to predict."

        "description": "The password hash for AES encryption is used as a key without any checks for its validity or integrity. The key should be validated against a known good baseline to ensure it is not predictable or weak, or to ensure it is generated correctly.",
        "recommuption": "Use a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 for password hashing, ensuring that the resulting hash value is sufficiently random and difficult to predict. Verify the integrity of the key and use a method that generates it securely and without predictable patterns."

        "vulnerable_method": "getSecretKeySpec",
        "vulnerable_code": "byte[] pwdHash = secure hash(password);",
        "description": "The password hash for AES encryption uses 128 bits of data for the key. Using a key length lower than the recommended 256 bits of data may result in weaker encryption.",
        "recommendation": "Generate a hash of the password and use a portion of this hash as the key for AES encryption. To meet the best security practices, use the 256-bit version of AES."

For the above mentioned misuses, the recommendations provided are general guidelines and the actual implementation might need to adjust based on the specific requirements and constraints.
