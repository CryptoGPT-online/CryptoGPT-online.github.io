Here is the security issue I found in the above code:

1. Default Password and Salt
The provided code hard-codes a default password and salt which are both included in the same source file. This potentially introduces a security risk as the password and salt are not securely stored and should be generated randomly for each user and stored in a secure manner. The password and salt should be stored separately and not be hardcoded in the code.

JSON Format:
```json
{
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "vulnerable_method": "public class SunJceCrypt",
    "vulnerable_code": "private final static int COUNT = 17;\npublic final static byte[] SALT = { (byte)0x15, (byte)0x8c, (byte)a3, (byte)0x4a, (byte)0x66, (byte)0x51, (byte)0x2a, (byte)0bc };",
    "description": "The default password and salt in this code are hardcoded and should be randomized for increased security.",
    "recommendation": "Remove hardcoded password and salt and replace them with a secure random generator to generate a password and salt for encryption."
}
```
