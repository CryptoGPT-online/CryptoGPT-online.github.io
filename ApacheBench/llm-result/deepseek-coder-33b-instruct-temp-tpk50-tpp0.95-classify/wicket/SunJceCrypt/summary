  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
    "description": "The algorithm PBEWithMD5AndDES is used for encryption and decryption, which employs the broken MD5 for key derivation and vulnerable DES for encryption. It lacks resistance to attacks and does not support a block size of anything other than 8 bytes, making it susceptible to the generation of collisions."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
    "description": "The key derivation function does not use a random salt, instead, a fixed salt is employed alongside a hardcoded iteration count of 17, which is considered to be low. Both practices diminish the security of the encryption as they are susceptible to compromise and can facilitate attacks."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
    "description": "The code does not handle certificate validation when handling encryption that should be protected by a certificate. This creates a vulnerability where encryption is performed without ensuring the certificate's validity and trustworthiness."
