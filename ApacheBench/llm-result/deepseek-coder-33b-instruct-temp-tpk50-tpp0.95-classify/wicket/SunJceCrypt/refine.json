        "description": "The provided code uses the PBEWithMD5AndDES method for encryption and decryption. This algorithm is known to be weak and has been criticized for lack of resistance to attacks. It has been suggested to use other cipher algorithms instead.",
        "recommendation": "Use a secure algorithm for cryptographic operations. Candidates are algorithms that are proven to be resistant to attacks. For example, AES with a large number of rounds, or ChaCha20."

        "description": "The salt used for encryption is a hard-coded static value, which means it does not vary, making it predictable and potentially insecure. This could allow an attacker to pre-compute the encryption keys and gain unauthorized access.",
        "recommendation": "Use a randomly generated salt for each encryption operation. This can be done by using a secure random number generator to generate a salt for each encryption."
