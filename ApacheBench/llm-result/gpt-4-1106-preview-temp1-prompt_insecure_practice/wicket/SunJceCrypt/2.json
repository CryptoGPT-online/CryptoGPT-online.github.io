    "description": "The code uses PBEWithMD5AndDES which relies on DES encryption algorithm and MD5 for password-based encryption. DES is considered insecure due to its 56-bit key size, and MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Use a stronger algorithm like 'PBEWithHmacSHA256AndAES_256'. Ensure to also securely generate and store cryptographic keys, and consider using key stretching techniques like PBKDF2 if applicable."

    "vulnerable_code": "public final static byte[] SALT = { ... };",
    "description": "The static salt value is hard-coded within the class which means it is the same for every encryption. This makes the encryption vulnerable to dictionary attacks and pre-computed rainbow tables.",
    "recommendation": "Generate a unique, random salt for each encryption operation. Store the salt alongside the encrypted data so it can be used for decryption."

    "vulnerable_code": "private final static int COUNT = 17;",
    "description": "The iteration count (COUNT) used for key generation is statically set to a low number. A low iteration count makes it easier for attackers to apply brute force attacks.",
    "recommendation": "Increase the iteration count to a minimum value recommended by current standards (at the time of knowledge cutoff, this is typically at least 10,000 iterations). Consider allowing this value to be configurable to adapt to newer recommendations."

    "recommendation": "Catch and handle specific exceptions that could be thrown during cryptographic operations to properly manage error cases and avoid unintended behavior."
