  "description": "The Database class retrieves database connection using potentially sensitive information such as username and password in plaintext. Prepared statements are used which mitigates SQL injection but raw strings are set directly which might be sensitive. Transaction handling does not appear to have a clear mechanism for protecting the integrity of transaction operations.",
  "recommendation": "Sensitive information for database connections should not be passed in plaintext. Use a secured method to store and retrieve sensitive credentials. For better transactional security, use mechanisms that ensure ACID properties are enforced, such as atomic operations, and consider preventing concurrent transaction issues. Also obfuscate query parameters when possible."
