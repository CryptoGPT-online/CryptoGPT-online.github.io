    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The Diff class and its 'diff' method implement a custom diff algorithm (MyersDiff) that may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks. An alternative approach is recommended for enhanced security."

    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "description": "The 'randomSequence' method contains hard-coded credentials that can be exploited if used for authentication or encryption, and the 'diff' method has hardcoded original sequences leading to potential credential exposure."

    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "description": "The implementation assigns 'null' to the 'rev' variable within the 'diff' method, potentially resulting in improper certificate validation issues."
