Here are the consolidated misuses with duplicates removed and formatted as per the requested JSON structure:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "description": "The use of weak algorithms like MD5, PBEWithMD5AndDES or unspecified encryption algorithms can be vulnerable to various types of attacks such as collision attacks and can be exploited to decrypt the encrypted data."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
        "description": "Downloading data or writing an image to a temporary file without proper certificate validation can result in a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker may intercept and potentially modify the data being transferred."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
        "description": "Using hardcoded values (such as a hostname or password) as a salt for key generation or relying on insufficiently random number generators can lead to vulnerabilities where generated values are predictable which can be exploited in brute-force attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
        "description": "Encryption using an insufficient number of iterations or weaker algorithms like JPEG for compression can lead to vulnerabilities due to inadequate encryption strength or lossy compression that might expose sensitive data."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
        "description": "Using a hardcoded password for key derivation or encryption can be a significant security risk if the password is easily obtained by malicious users."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
        "description": "Not specifying the algorithm for encryption or utilizing less-secure image formats can result in the use of a weak algorithm, making it vulnerable to various attacks."
    }
