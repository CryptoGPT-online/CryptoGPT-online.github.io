    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "description": "Weak encryption algorithms used across getCipher(), getVersionProperty(), and encrypt() methods can be easily broken, compromising data security."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
        "description": "Lack of proper certificate validation in obfuscate and ManifoldCF methods can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks."

        "description": "Inadequate encryption strength in encrypt(), ManifoldCF.encrypt(), ManifoldCF.decrypt(), ManifoldCF.obfuscate(), and ManifoldCF.deobfuscate() methods due to the use of insecure algorithms or weak keys."

    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
        "description": "Hardcoded credentials in getMasterDatabaseName() and ManifoldCF methods expose systems to unauthorized access."
    },

        "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation.",
        "description": "Selection of insecure algorithms in getCipher() and ManifoldCF methods, which may lead to a weaker cryptographic scheme being used than intended."
    }

```

Note that several entries have been merged under a misuse category because they refer to a similar problem, just manifested in different parts of the codebase.
