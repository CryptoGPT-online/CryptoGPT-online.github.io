 I have checked the code for any instances of insecure cryptographic usage and potential vulnerabilities, but I did not find any. Here is a JSON-formatted response with the result of the security audit:

{
"misuses": [],
"vulnerable_methods": [],
"vulnerable_code": [],
"description": "No security vulnerabilities or misuses were found in the provided code.",
"recommendation": "None needed."
}
