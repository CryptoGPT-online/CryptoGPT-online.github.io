After removing duplicates and consolidating the records, the sorted list of potential cryptographic API misuses is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
    "description": "The code uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered broken and insecure, in multiple methods including 'DesCbcMd5Encryption.encrypt()' and 'DesCbcMd5Encryption.decrypt()', as it can be compromised relatively easily due to its short key length."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials",
    "description": "The code contains hardcoded encryption keys in methods like 'DesCbcMd5Encryption', posing a risk of key extraction and unauthorized data encryption or decryption because the keys are embedded in the source code."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation",
    "description": "The 'calculateIntegrity' method is used in 'DesCbcMd5Encryption.getEncryptedData' without properly validating the certificate of the encryption algorithm, which could allow attackers to manipulate the checksum."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation",
    "description": "The 'DesCbcMd5Encryption.getEncryptionType()' method selects a less secure algorithm DES_CBC_MD5 during negotiation, which may be vulnerable to attacks."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
    "description": "The 'DesCbcMd5Encryption.getRandomBytes()' method uses an insecure random function that could lead to predictable results, increasing the risk of cryptographic attacks."
  },
  {
    "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength",
    "description": "The 'DesCbcMd5Encryption.getEncryptedData()' method utilizes an encryption algorithm with inadequate strength, such as DES with a short key length, which may be susceptible to attacks."
  }
]
``` 

Since some of the misuses share CWE identifiers but have different descriptions or occur in different methods, they have been listed separately.
