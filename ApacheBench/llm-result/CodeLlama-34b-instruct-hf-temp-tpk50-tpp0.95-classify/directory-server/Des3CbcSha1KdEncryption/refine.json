 ### False Positive Misuses

There are several misuses reported in the code that are not applicable or are not actually misuses. Here is a list of the false positive misuses and the reasons why they are not real misuses:

1. "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" - This misuse is not applicable because the code is using the Triple DES algorithm, which is a widely used and well-established algorithm that is not considered to be broken or risky.
2. "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation" - This misuse is not applicable because the code is not using any certificate validation.
3. "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values" - This misuse is not applicable because the code is not using any random values.
4. "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength" - This misuse is not applicable because the code is not using any encryption strength that is considered to be inadequate.

        "recommendation": "Replace HmacSHA1 with a stronger algorithm, such as HmacSHA256."
    }
]
```
In summary, the provided code has several potential cryptographic security misuses, including using a weak encryption algorithm, using a hardcoded initialization vector (IV), using a hardcoded key, and using a weak key generation method. However, some of the reported misuses are not actually misuses, such as using a random IV and key for each encryption operation. It is important to carefully review the code and consider the context to determine if any reported misuses are actually applicable and should be fixed.
