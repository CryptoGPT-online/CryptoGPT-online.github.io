After consolidating the duplicated misuses and arranging them based on the provided format, the final list is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
        "description": "The code uses the Triple DES cryptographic algorithm (also known as DESede), which is considered insecure and vulnerable to attacks. It is recommended to replace this with a more secure algorithm, such as AES."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.",
        "description": "The code creates a SecretKeySpec object using the DESede algorithm and uses default initialization vectors (IV), which are not secure. Secure practice requires using a random IV for each encryption to prevent attacks."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength.",
        "description": "The code uses a weak encryption key (64-bit) and a small iteration count (168) for the encryption algorithm, as well as the HmacSHA1 algorithm with a 160-bit key. It should consider using stronger encryption keys, higher iteration counts, and more secure algorithms such as HmacSHA256."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials.",
        "description": "The code uses a hardcoded initialization vector (IV) for the encryption algorithm, which is a security risk. It is advised to generate the IV dynamically or use a random value for each encryption operation."
    },
    {
        "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.",
        "description": "The code uses the default key generation method for the encryption algorithm, which is not secure. Using random keys for each encryption enhances the security of the cryptographic process."
