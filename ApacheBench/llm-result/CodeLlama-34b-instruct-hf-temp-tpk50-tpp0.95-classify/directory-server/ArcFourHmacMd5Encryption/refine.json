 ### False Positive Misuse

* CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials
	+ Vulnerable method: `ArcFourHmacMd5Encryption.getDecryptedData`
	+ Vulnerable code: `return data.getCipher();`
	+ Description: The encryption engine uses a hardcoded value for the IV, which could allow an attacker to carry out a plaintext attack.
	+ Recommendation: Use a strong source of randomness for generating the IV, such as the Java `SecureRandom` class.
