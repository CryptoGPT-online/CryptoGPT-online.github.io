### False Positive Misuse ###

The misuse labeled as `CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values for cryptographic context.` is a false positive. The `Diff.randomEdit` method in the provided code uses `java.util.Random`, but this method and its context are designed for non-security purposes (such as generating diff test cases or random modifications in a text), where cryptographic strength randomness is not required nor expected. This is an example of an appropriate use of `java.util.Random` for non-security purposes.
