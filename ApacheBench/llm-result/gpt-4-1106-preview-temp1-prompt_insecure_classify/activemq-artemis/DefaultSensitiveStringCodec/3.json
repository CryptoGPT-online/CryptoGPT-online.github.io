    "description": "The code converts the encrypted byte[] to a BigInteger, then to a hex String. Depending on the byte array, this could lead to loss of leading zeros. It does not directly relate to the strength of the encryption but could lead to predictable/corrupt output from the encryption which could reduce security in certain contexts.",

    "recommendation": "Increase the number of iterations to at least 10000 to improve the strength of the hash."
