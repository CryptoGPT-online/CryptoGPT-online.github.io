### False Positive Misuse ###
The misuse reported for "CWE-798: Use of Hardcoded Credentials" is a false positive. The code in question is hashing a masterSalt provided by the user. While the code does not show where the masterSalt comes from, it is an input to the method, and there is no indication in the code itself that this is hardcoded or non-unique. Therefore, assuming the masterSalt is properly managed, this would not constitute a use of hardcoded credentials, and I am listing this as a false positive.
