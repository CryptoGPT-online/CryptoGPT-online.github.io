### False Positive Misuse ###

1. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
   - This finding suggests "any transformation" might be insecure due to weak algorithms. However, since the code does not specify any predetermined ciphers, keys, modes, or paddings, it's designed to be flexible and use input parameters from a presumably secure source. The caller of this method is assumed to provide secure settings; thus, this misuse can be a false positive if correct parameters are supplied.

2. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
   - SecureRandom usage is criticized for potentially being insecure or not properly initialized. Yet the code rightly depends on the assumption that the caller provides a secure and properly initialized `SecureRandom` instance. The responsibility lies with the caller, and if the caller correctly provides a strong `SecureRandom` instance, then this misuse report is a false positive.

3. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
   - Similar to CWE-326, this finding assumes the transformation could be insecure. Since the transformation string comes from external sources assumed to be secure, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure a secure, NIST-recommended algorithm is used. If that is the case, then this report can be considered a false positive.

Given the abstract nature of `CryptoParser` and the expectation that it's used securely by the calling code, all reported misuses are considered false positives. They could, however, be valid if the calling code provides insecure parameters.

The misuse list has been cleared since, under the assumption of correct usage by the calling code, the previously identified issues are false positives. The responsibility for secure usage lies with the implementers who provide the specific cryptographic parameters.
