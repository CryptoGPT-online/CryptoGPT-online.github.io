  "description": "Triple-DES (3DES) is considered to have inadequate encryption strength due to its effective key length of 112 bits. Modern standards require the use of stronger algorithms such as AES.",
  "recommendation": "Replace Triple-DES with AES and ensure a strong key generation mechanism."

  "vulnerable_code": "private static final byte[] _3desData = ... ; private static final SecretKeySpec KEY = new SecretKeySpec(_3desData, \"DESede\");",
  "description": "The static key _3desData used across the application poses a security risk, as the hardcoded key could be extracted by decompiling the bytecode or through other means.",
  "recommendation": "Use a dynamically generated key or store the key securely outside the application and retrieve it during runtime."
