### False Positive Misuse ###

- There are no false positives in the misuse lists. The misuses listed accurately represent issues related to using weak cryptographic algorithms (Triple DES), hard-coded encryption keys, and failing to use secure random values for initializations vectors (IVs) which can lead to predictable cryptographic operations.

        "vulnerable_code": "Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION)",
        "description": "Triple-DES (3DES) is considered to have inadequate encryption strength due to its effective key length of 112 bits. Modern standards require the use of stronger algorithms such as AES.",
