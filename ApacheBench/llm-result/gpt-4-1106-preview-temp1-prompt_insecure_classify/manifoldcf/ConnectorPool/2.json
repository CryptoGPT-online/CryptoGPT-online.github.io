    "misuse": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values for cryptographic context",
    "vulnerable_method": "ConnectorPool.Pool.pollAll",
    "vulnerable_code": "protected final static Random randomNumberGenerator = new Random();",
    "description": "The class ConnectorPool uses a Random object for distributing the load of connectors. However, Random does not provide a cryptographically strong random number generator. While the specific use in the load distribution mechanism might not be security-critical, it indicates a general misunderstanding of the security implications of randomness, which could lead to vulnerabilities in other contexts where secure randomness is crucial.",
    "recommendation": "Switch to java.security.SecureRandom for cryptographic contexts to generate stronger random numbers."
