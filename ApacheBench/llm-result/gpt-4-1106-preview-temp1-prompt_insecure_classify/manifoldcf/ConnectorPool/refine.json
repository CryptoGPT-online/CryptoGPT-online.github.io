### False Positive Misuse ###
After reviewing the provided code and misuse lists, it is clear that the usage of `java.util.Random` pointed out in the lists is not for cryptographic purposes but for load distribution. The `randomNumberGenerator.nextInt(numServices)` is used to create a fair distribution of resources, not to generate cryptographic keys or other security-sensitive operations. Therefore, the reported misuse of `java.util.Random` in this non-cryptographic context is a false positive.
